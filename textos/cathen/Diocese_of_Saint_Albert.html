<h1>Diocese of Saint Albert</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI ALBERTI).

<p>The immense territories, known today as the Provinces of Manitoba, <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Saskatchewan</a>, and Alberta, formed till 1871 only one diocese under the name of St. Boniface. On 22 Sept., 1871, St. Boniface having been elevated to the rank of archdiocese, the new Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> was canonically erected and Right Rev. Vital J. Grandin, O.M.I. (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 30 Nov., 1859, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13485c.htm">Satala</a> and appointed co-adjutor of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Boniface) was transferred to the new see. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> died on 3 June, 1902, after a long episcopate of nearly forty-five years, and half a century of missionary life. He was succeeded by Right Rev. Emile J. Legal, O.M.I. (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178b.htm">Pogla</a>, 17 June, 1897, and coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>, 3 June, 1902). This diocese, even after having been subdivided in 1891 to form the Vicariate Apostolic of Saskatchewan, comprises the southern half of Province of Alberta and the western part of <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Saskatchewan</a>, an area of some 150,000 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the 110th degree of longitude; on the west by the Rocky Mountains; on the south by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and on the north by the 55th degree of latitude. At the time of its erection, the total population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was from 4000 to 5000 half-breeds, 10,000 to 12,000 Indians belonging to half a dozen tribes, and a few hundred white people, employees of the Hudson Bay Company. The evangelization of this new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was then entrusted to twelve <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>.

<p>Five missions had been established, hundreds of miles apart. The first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was a log-house and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace a small frame building. Three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> were in charge of Sisters of Charity. The whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbered scarcely 10,000.

<p>Though cut off from all means of communication with the civilized world, receiving but a yearly mail, deprived not only of all comfort, but even of the necessaries of life, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to travel long distances, camping outside for weeks and even months consecutively, in cold of 30 to 40 degrees, to spread the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine Faith and establish here and there new centres of missions, the first two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> and their missionaries never despaired or lost <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the future of their work. After several years of hard struggle a great change became apparent. In 1874-75, the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Government having established a few posts of mounted police in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, new settlements were founded. Reservations for the Indians were established; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and missions built. At the same time a considerable number of half-breeds from <a href="../cathen/09602a.htm">Manitoba</a> settled in the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where they soon formed new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions. In 1883-84 the opening of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Pacific Railway brought colonies of immigrants, and soon the work of the missions was much increased. In 1890 the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> was divided, and the Vicariate Apostolic of Saskatchewan created, which in 1911 was erected as a diocese.

<p>Since 1890 the development of the missionary work has been wonderful. An appeal was made in 1891 to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> to come and help the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a> who could no longer attend alone to so many stations, missions, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, already erected or urgently needed. Several <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and later several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders came to help in the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and evangelization. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is now 55,000, of which about 15,000 are Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They are attended by 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; 98 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 20 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; and 33 seminarists. There are: churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 56; missions, 55; stations, 98; communities of men, 9, of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 15; boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 14; 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Indians; boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for Indians, 8; primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 60; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 11; hospices, 2; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 20. The great majority of the Cree Indians have been converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and the Blackfeet have of late manifested better dispositions. French, English, German, and Polish-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions of their own. Thousands of Galicians of the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rite have started three flourishing missions attended by <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Fathers of the same rite. A community of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, belonging also to the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been founded to take charge of their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>.

<p>The Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>, after many years of almost insurmountable obstacles and difficulties, has become one of the most promising of Western <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. It is crossed by the transcontinental lines of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Pacific, the Grand Trunk Pacific and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Northern Railways, and towns and villages spring up almost every ten miles. Immigrants come daily from all parts of the civilized world. Among them a fair proportion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> take possession of the soil, settle on their homesteads, and new fields of missionary labour are incessantly open to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>.
