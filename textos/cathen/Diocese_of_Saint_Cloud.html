<h1>Diocese of Saint Cloud</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI CLODOALDI).

<p>A suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">Archdiocese of St. Paul, Minnesota</a>, comprises the counties of Stearns, Sherburne, Benton, Morrison, Mille Lacs, Kanabec, Grant, Pope, Stevens, Isanti, Traverse, Douglas, Wilkin, Otter-Tail, Todd, Wadena, in the <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">State of Minnesota</a>, an area of 12,251 square miles. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resides in St. Cloud, Stearns county. In 1680 <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a> visited the Indians at Mille Lacs, and for one hundred and seventy years no other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> came to these regions. In 1851, when this part of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a> was thrown open to white settlers, the history of the Diocese of St. Cloud begins. In 1852 Rev. Francis Pierz (Pirc), a native of Carniola, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, came from his former Indian missions at Lake Superior to Minnesota to labour among the <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewa Indians</a>. Finding the country well adapted to agriculture, he announced the fact in some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> German papers, and thus caused a large immigration of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, especially to Stearns county. In 1856 Bishop Cretin of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> sent three <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Fathers Demetrius de Marogna, Cornelius Wittmann, and Bruno Riss, to attend the ever-&igrave;ncreasing numbers of settlers. They settled on a piece of land near the present city of St. Cloud, where they built a small log house and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. In 1857 they erected a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, and opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with five pupils. A change of location, however, was desirable, hence land was secured around St. John's Lake, and in 1866 a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were permanently established. They have now flourishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with more than three hundred students. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Rt. Rev. Rupert Seidenbusch, was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Northern Minnesota (1875). He resided in St. Cloud until 1888 when, on account of poor health, he resigned. He built the present pro-cathedral and died 3 June, 1895. The present Diocese of St. Cloud was created in 1889 with Rt. Rev. Dr. Otto Zardetti as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Dr. Zardetti, a native of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, was born 24 Jan., 1846. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 21 Aug., 1870, and in 1881 became professor of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> in the St. Francis Seminary, near Milwaukee. In 1886 he was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Bishop Marty of Yankton. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Cloud, he was extremely active, and renowned as a <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator. In Feb., 1894, he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03045a.htm">Bucharest</a> in <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 9 May, 1902. When he took charge of the Diocese of St. Cloud, he found about 30,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the charge of 69 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 52 religious and 17 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. When he resigned, there were about 40,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the charge of 33 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 16 religious, besides 19 religious in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. His successor was Rt. Rev. Martin Marty, O.S.B., also a native of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In 1879 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Dakota, residing in Yankton, in 1889 first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14016b.htm">Sioux Falls, South Dakota</a>, and 31 Dec., 1894, was transferred to St. Cloud. He took charge of the new see 12 March, 1895, but died 19 Sept., 1896. Rt. Rev. Mgr. Jos. Bauer was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 28 Sept., 1897, when the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, James Trobec, arrived as third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There are about 62,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 125 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 78 secular and 47 religious; 115 churches and 12 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; 2 academies; 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; 1 home for old people; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> wherever possible. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and the Holy Cross Fathers; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters, who number about 400 and have charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and a home for the aged; the Sisters of St. Francis, who have charge of an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> and three <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; the Sisters of St. Mary of the Presentation.
