<h1>Diocese of Sejny</h1>  

<p>(AUGUST&#211;WO; SEJNESIS, or AUGUSTOVIENSIS).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the northwestern part of Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> near the border of East Prussia, of Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> near the border of East Prussia, German <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Its territory formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Diocese of Vilna</a>, but upon the first partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> it fell to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Consequently a separate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> was desired, and so <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, on 27 March, 1798, carved out the new diocese and established its see at the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Wigry, a village about ten miles east of the present city of Suwalki. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Camaldoli was founded under the patronage of King Jagiello in 1418, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady, which became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, is now the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Wigry. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was the celebrated preacher Michael Francis Karpowicz (b. 1744; d. 1805). His successor was John Clement Golaszewski (b. 1748; d. 1820), who enlarged the Wigry <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After the third partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> this territory was ceded to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in 1818 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the Polish kingdom was reorganized. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> Warsaw was made the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Wigry was changed to August&oacute;wo, a city founded in 1561 by King Sigmund Augustus, after who, it was named, which is still the largest place in that section (population 65,690). The new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and chapter there were inaugurated on December 8, 1819. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Ignatius Czyzewski, the first to rule the newly named diocese, did not remain at August&oacute;wo, but changed his place of residence in 1823 to Sejny, a town founded in 1522 by King Sigmund I, and which is about twenty miles east of Suwalki, the capital of the district. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Nicholas John Manugiewicz, established the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1830, and for many years resided sometimes at August&oacute;wo and then at Sejny. His successor was Stanislaus Choromanski, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. Then next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Straszynski, made the old <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church at Sejny his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and entered it as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 4 February, 1837. He was in frequent collision with the Russian authorities, and on his death in 1847 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was kept vacant by the Russian Government until 1873. Constantine Lubienski was then made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and on his death in 1869 at Nowgrodzie was succeeded by Bishop Wierzbowski. His successor was Anthony Baranowdki, and the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1911) is Anthony Karas. Sejny has the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, chapter and consistory, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Simon managed by the Sisters of Charity. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into eleven deaneries and has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 692,250. There are 119 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and 20 subordinate ones, besides 100 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 352 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, 86 seminarians, 24 lay religious, besides 8 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 26 Sisters of Charity. Owing to the Russian regulations against receiving <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and monastic institutions are dying out.
