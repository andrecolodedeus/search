<p>(S<font size=-2>ANCTI</font> J<font size=-2>OSEPHI</font>)

<p>The City of St. Joseph, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, was founded by Joseph Robidoux, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, who in 1830 became sole proprietor of the trading post at the mouth of what is now called Roy's Branch, just above the Blacksnake Hills. In 1838 an itinerant <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> visited the obscure trading post at this place and said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the rude log house of Robidoux. In 1840 Rev. Father Vogel administered to the spiritual wants of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Robidoux, alive to the importance of his trading post, began preparations to form a town. The population was about two hundred at that time. He had surveys and plats made by Fred W. Smith, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Smith named his plat St. Joseph; it was taken to St. Louis and recorded on 26 July, 1843. The first permanent <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was the Rev. Thomas Scanlon, who began his labours in 1847. On 17 June, 1847, a brick church was begun and in September of the same year was dedicated by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop P.R. Kenrick</a> of St. Louis. The &quot;Overland Period&quot; was the most important one in the infancy of St. Joseph. Early in the spring of 1849 began the rush to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. As a starting point St. Joseph offered advantages which no other place possessed. There was at that time a population of 1900 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866, St. Joseph was among the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> proposed. Rev. John J. Hogan was chosen its first Bishop, 3 March, 1868. The area assigned to the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was that part of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a> lying between the Missouri and Chariton Rivers. On Investigation the bishop-elect found that there were in the Diocese of St. Joseph 600 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, about 3000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, attended by five <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The church edifices were of the poorest kind; the largest (pro-cathedral) was a low, narrow, brick building, built at three different times. Bishop Hogan was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop P.R. Kenrick</a>, 13 September, 1868, and at once took charge of his new field of labour. In 1869 ground was broken for a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which, three years later, was opened for Divine service. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> increased gradually, religious consciousness and enthusiasm were awakened, churches were built, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> erected, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> founded. On 10 September, 1880 Bishop Hogan was transferred to the newly-erected <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Diocese of Kansas City</a>, Mo., and appointed Administrator of St. Joseph. When he resigned his administration of the Diocese of St. Joseph, in 1893, the Rt. Rev. M. F. Burke, D.D., was transferred from the <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Diocese of Cheyenne, Wyoming</a>, to St. Joseph. His reception by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> was most enthusiastic. Under his able administration great progress has been made in the material to well as in the spiritual upbuilding of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> has been liquidated, an episcopal residence built, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> erected at a cost of $60,000, new missions opened and new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> organized.

<p>The City of St. Joseph has at present 8 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 12 resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attended by 1340 pupils, 1 commercial-college conducted by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, 1 academy for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young ladies conducted by the Ladies of the Sacred Heart conducted by the Sisters of Charity. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population: 10,000. Outside of the City of St. Joseph may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey at Conception, established in 1874; the Concepti&oacute;n Classical College conducted by the Fathers of the Abbey; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers at Chillicoth and Wien; two charitable <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, one at Chillicoth conducted by the Sisters of St. Mary, the other at Maryville conducted by the Sisters of St. Francis; an academy for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young ladies at Chillicothe conducted by the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>; the mother-house and academy of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters of Perpetual Adoration at Clyde; an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> at Conception; twenty churches with resident priests; thirty-two mission stations; and seven <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of the Consistory, dated <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 June, 1911, the territory containing the Counties of Adair, Clark, Knox, Lewis, <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, Marion, Monroe, Ralls, Radolph, Shelby, Schuyler, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and that part of Chariton County east of the Chariton River was detached from the Archdiocese of St. Louis and attached to the Diocese of St. Joseph. By reason of this extension the Diocese of St. Joseph now comprises the whole northern part of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a>, extending from the Missouri to the Mississippi River, and is bounded on the south by the Counties of Howard, Boone, Audrain, and Pike. By the increase of territory 16 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have been added, and 20 more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have been affiliated with the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is (1911) about 34,000.
