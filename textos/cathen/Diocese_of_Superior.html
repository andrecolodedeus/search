<h1>Diocese of Superior</h1>  

<p>(SUPERIORENSIS)

<p>Situated in the northern part of <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, Superior comprises the following counties: Ashland, Barron, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, Iron, Lincoln, Oneida, Polk, Price, Rusk, Sawyer, St. Croix, Taylor, Vilas, and Washburn. In area it covers 15,715 square miles, and has its episcopal residence in the city of Superior. On 3 May, 1905, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established, being formed from the northern part of the <a href="../cathen/08735b.htm">Diocese of La Crosse</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08735b.htm">DIOCESE OF LA CROSSE</a>) and the northwestern part of the <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Diocese of Green Bay</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">DIOCESE OF GREEN BAY</a>).

<p>When Superior, which is one of the suffragans of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, was formed, there were 39 secular and 17 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attending to the needs of the people in 93 churches and 33 stations. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population at the time was about 38,000. Besides the English-speaking congregations there were then as there are at present churches in which the spiritual wants of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Poles, French, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, Slovaks and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> were looked after. The spiritual and other needs of the Indians of the district have been well taken care of. There are flourishing industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Odonah, Bayfield, and other places, that are under the charge of the Sisters of St. Francis and are attended by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, ably seconded by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, has started throughout the diocese wherever it was possible <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young. In consequence the various cities and towns have one or more such bringing excellent results, considering the meagre resources available. At Superior and Ashland especially the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are well attended.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, still in office, is the Rt. Rev. Augustin Francis Schinner, D. D. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 July, 1905, and appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Superior 13 May of the same year. He came to Superior from <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, where he had held the position of administrator of the archdiocese after the death of Archbishop Katzer. Bishop Schinner was born in Milwaukee 1 May, 1863. He entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at St. Francis, Wis., and at the age of twenty-two on 7 March, 1886, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Archbishop Heiss of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>. For about a year he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Richfield, Wis., and was then made a professor at St. Francis Seminary, Milwaukee. In 1891 Archbishop Katzer selected him as his secretary, and in 1895 he was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the archdiocese, holding the same position under Archbishop Messmer, until his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Superior.

<p>There are now in the diocese the following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men: <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>; and of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: Fransciscan <a href="../cathen/11698b.htm">Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</a>, Sisters of St. Agnes, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12254a.htm">Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ</a>, Sisters of St. Francis, School-Sisters of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Charity, School-Sisters of Notre Dame, Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother, Sisters of the Divine Saviour, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. There are (1911): <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 56; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 23; churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 55; missions with churches, 65; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 8; stations, 23; high school, 1; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 23; pupils of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 4869; industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2; inmates, 225; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 45; total number of young people under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care, 5094; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 5; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population (Census of 1910): White, 48,028; Indians, 3015.
