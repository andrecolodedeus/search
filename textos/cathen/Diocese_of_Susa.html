<h1>Diocese of Susa</h1>  

<p>(SEGUSIN; SEGUSIENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated at an elevation of about 1600 feet above sea-level, in a wide valley to the right of the Dora Riparia; near by are some valuable marble quarries (<em>verde di Susa</em>). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a> and founded by Ulderico Manfredi, (1029) contains much of interest: specimens of very fine inlaid work in the choir stalls; the <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a> and the bronze group of the "Madonna del Roccia Melone" (Madonna with the Child, <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> transfixing the dragon, and a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> on <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">bended knee</a>); in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> may be seen the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Countess Adelaide with her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in wood, an excellent example of eleventh-century work, In ancient times the city was called Segusio, and in the days of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> it still had a king, who held sway over fourteen other towns. This king submitted <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to the Romans and erected, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, a triumphal arch, which still exists. Under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> the kingdom was abolished and became a municipium. In addition to the arch, there still exist the ruins of the Therm&aelig; Gratian&aelig; constructed by Valentinian I. Susa being situated near one of the principal Alpine valleys was always a place of great strategic importance. Constantine destroyed it while advancing against <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>; after the Langobard invasion, the Byzantine garrison remained there till 593. Later it came into possession of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. It was captured twice by Pepin and once by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (774), who by a skilful man&oelig;uvre compelled the Lombards to fall back on Pavia. From that time it formed part of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. In 942 it became the residence of Ardoino Glabrio, Count of Susa and later Marquis of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, who was succeeded by Manfredo (975), Olderico (1001), and Adelaide (1034). The latter having married Odo of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> in her third marriage, Susa passed into the power of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In the twelfth century it acquired communal liberty; though destroyed (1174) by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, it soon rose again, and in 1197 had already adopted new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the thirteenth century it sided with the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, and was a subject of dispute between the marquises of <a href="../cathen/13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a> and the counts of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; it was definitely given to the latter in 1295. Later during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries it fell on five occasions into the hands of the French (1536-62; 1628-31; 1639-42; 1704-7; 1798-1814); in 1798 the fortifications constructed by the dukes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> were dismantled.

<p>In early days, Susa seems to have belonged to the Diocese of Maurienne. The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a> having been erected in 1029, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had quasi-episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> succeeded the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, and under <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> were replaced by secular canons. In 1772 this prelacy <em>nullius</em> became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the territory of the famous Abbey of Novalesa was added to that of Susa. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Francesco M. Ferraris. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> suppressed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1803, but it was restored in 1817, and its territory increased by the inclusion of the Abbey S. Michele della Chiusa. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, contains 61 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 75,000 inhabitants, and 130 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> priests; 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 7 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; 3 institutes for boys and 3 for girls.
