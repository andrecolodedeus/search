<h1>Diocese of Tarentaise</h1>  

<p>(TARANTASIENSIS)

<p>Tarentaise comprises the arrondissement of Moutiers in the Department of Savoie; it is also sometimes called the Diocese of Moutiers en Tarentaise, and is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>. Legend relates that the "Centrones" were evangelized in the fifth century by James the Assyrian secretary to <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles. He became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Darantasia or Tarentaise, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the "Centrones", and named St. Marcellus as his successor. The first document in which the Diocese of Tarentaise is reliably mentioned is a letter of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> (5 May, 450) which assigns to the Archdiocese of Vienne, among other suffragans, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tarentaise. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Sanctius who in 517 assisted at the Council of Epaon. A plea was brought before the <a href="../cathen/06236a.htm">Council of Frankfort</a> (794) against the decision of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> that had been confirmed by Popes Symmachus and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>. <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> partly acceded to this plea, and made Darantasia a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> with three suffragans, <a href="../cathen/01591c.htm">Aosta</a>, <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, and Maurienne, but maintained the primacy of Vienne. For four centuries this primacy was the cause of conflicts between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Tarentaise and those of Vienne; subsequently Maurienne was again attached to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Vienne.

<p>The city of Darantasia was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in the tenth century, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> moved their residence to the right bank of the Is&eacute;re, calling it their <em>moutier</em> (monastery), and it was at this place that the town of Moutiers began to be built in the second half of the tenth century. In the twelfth century the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Tarentaise were powerful sovereigns. In 1186 a bull of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> recognized the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarentaise as immediate vassal of the empire and prince of the Holy Roman Empire in disregard of the pretensions of Humbert III, Count of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; but in 1358 a transaction between Archbishop Jean de Bertrand and the Count of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, Amadeus VI, fixed the respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and the counts. Tarentaise belonged to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from 1536 to 1559, and from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century was on four occasions wrested for a time by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In 1792 it formed the Department of Mont Blanc. The Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (30 May, 1814) gave it to the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, while the Plebiscite of 22 and 23 April, 1860, gave it to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Archdiocese of Moutiers in Tarentaise was suppressed in 1792 by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1825 a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was re-established at Moutiers, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, and was maintained in 1860 in virtue of a special clause in the treaty ceding <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Moutiers in Tarentaise may be mentioned: St. Peter I (about 1130), the first <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> raised to the episcopate, who founded in a defile the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Tami&eacute;, to serve as a shelter for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and travellers; the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> St. Peter II (1141-74) founded the charity of the <em>pain de Mai</em>, which until the second half of the eighteenth century distributed bread at Moutiers at the expense of the archdiocese during the first twenty-eight days of May; it was he who upheld <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> against <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>, and maintained in obedience to <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> the seven hundred <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>. Alexander decided (3 Feb., 1171) that thenceforth the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> See of Tarentaise should depend only on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; St. Peter III (1271-83); Cardinal Antoine* de Chalant (1402-18), to whom has been ascribed "Le livre du Roi Modus et de la reine Ratio", a much-esteemed treatise on hunting; Cardinal Jean d'Arces' (1438-54), who at the Council of Basle in 1440 supported Duke Amadeus of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, against <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>; Cardinals Christopher and Dominic de la Rov&eacute;re (1472-78 and 1478-83), whose <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> erected at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> del Popolo is a splendid monument of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; Germonio (1607-27), who played an important part in the seventeenth-century reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and whose "Commentaries" and "Acta Ecclesi&aelig; Tarentasiensis" are important documents for the history of the time. As natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Pope Nicholas II</a> (1059), born at Chevron-Villette of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the lords of Miolans; Pierre d'Aigueblanche, who in 1240 became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and for twenty-five years was councillor and minister to Henry III of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Blessed Peter of Tarentaise, who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1276 under the name of <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a>.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame de Brian&ccedil;on, which dates from the victory over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in the tenth century. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and Henry IV visited this shrine; Notre Dame des Vernettes, at Peisey, created in the eighteenth century near a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> fountain; Notre Dame de la Vie at St. Martin de Belleville; Notre Dame de Beaufort; St. Anne at Villette <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1248. Before the application of the Law of 1901 regarding associations there were in the diocese <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Augustinians of the Assumption</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and two orders of teaching brothers. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, nursing and teaching sisters, separated in 1825 from the Congregation of Puy. Several <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> are dependent on their mother-house at Moutiers. At the end of the nineteenth century religious congregations in the diocese were charged with: 4 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 6 infirmaries or <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 4 houses of retreat. In 1905 (end of the period of the Concordat) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> numbered 68,000 inhabitants, 7 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 79 succursal churches, and 21 vicariates remunerated by the Government.
