<h1>Diocese of Terracina, Sezze, and Piperno</h1>  

<p>(TERRACINENSIS, SETINENSIS ET PRIVERNENSIS)

<p>Located in the Province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The city of Terracina is near the estuary of the Amaseno, on a promontory (the old town), and beside the Via Appia (the new town, founded by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>). The harbour, one of the safest in the Mediterranean, is frequented mostly by coasting-vessels engaged in exporting grain from the Pontine marshes, and wine, oil, and vegetables from the Lepinian hills; hunting in the neighbouring woods and the fishing industry are also carried on with profit by the inhabitants. There are ruins of the temple of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, at the place now occupied by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. C&aelig;sareus, containing the pillars of the temple and an <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. On one of the promontories are ruins of the great temple of Venus; also traces of the fortifications and of the palace of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. Terracina, called by the Romans Tarracina, the ancient Auxur, was a Latin city, and was subject to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the kings. Later it was captured by the Volscians, who in 406 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> ceded it to the Romans. Hannibal, after capturing <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, failed to take it. Under <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a> the harbour was enlarged. It was included in Pepin's donation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but about 780 was captured by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, who, however, were expelled by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> landed there on several occasions during the ninth century. Later it was a fief of the Frangipani, but <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> included it among the places which were always to be <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1798, the French commander having been slain during a revolt, the city was sacked. According to tradition, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Terracina was St. Epaphroditus. The most ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> record of the city is that of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Julianus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and St. C&aelig;sareus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who were cast into the sea under <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>; in the third century St. Quartus (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>?) suffered. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose date is known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is Sabinus (313). Among his successors were: an African <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, St. Silvianus, a fugitive during the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (about 443); Petrus (590), during whose episcopate the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> so severely in Terracina that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> had to intervene; under Agnellus, former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fundi, which city had been destroyed, the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were united; the last three letters only of the name of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Terracina, . . . vsa, are preserved in an inscription (Corp. Inscr. Lat., X, I, 6419); other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Joannes (969), who made the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> that the inhabitants of the city should offer each year 6,000 eels to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>; Ambrosius (1066), a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reformer; Gregorius (1106), a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> surnamed <em>Columna Ecclesi&oelig;</em>. About this time, if not earlier, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Piperno</a> (Privernum) and Sezze (Setia), situated on the side of the Lepinian hills, were united to Terracina. The earliest of the seven known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Piperno</a> is Bonifacius (769). There is moreover an <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">ancient Christian cemetery</a> at Piperno. The first mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sezze is a reference to Stephanus (1036) in the time of Pollidius (1046), St. Ligdanus founded the Monastery of St. Cecilia near Sezze: among the others was Lando, who in 1178, under the name of Innocent III, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">usurped</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>. The union of the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1217) during the episcopate of Simeone. Among his successors were: the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fra Giovanni (1362), who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Zaccaria Mori (1510), present at the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a>; Ottaviano Rovera (1545), <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Bernardo M. Conti (1710), brother of <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In 1725 <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> restored the See of <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Piperno</a> and Sezze, declaring them united <em>&oelig;que principaliter</em>. Bishop Francesco Antonio Mondelli (1805) was exiled in 1809, for refusing to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of loyalty to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. The famous <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Fossa Nuova is within the territory of this see. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, contains 22 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 45,000 inhabitants, 94 secular and 15 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men, 10 for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 1 institute for boys and 3 for girls.
