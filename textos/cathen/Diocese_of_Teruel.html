<h1>Diocese of Teruel</h1>  

<p>(TUROLENSIS)

<p>A suffragan of Saragossa, comprises the civil province of the same name, excepting the town of Bechi (Castell&oacute;n). It is believed by some that Teruel and the ancient Turba are the same. Turba was the city whose disputes with the Saguntines gave Hannibal an excuse for attacking Saguntum and beginning the Second Punic War. According to the annals of Teruel it appears that Turba was not situated on the site of the present city of Teruel, but at its boundary line. Teruel was founded in 1176 by Sancho S&aacute;nchez* Mu&ntilde;oz and Blasco Garc&eacute;s Marcilla. It formed a separate community and was governed by the <em>Fuero de Sep&uacute;lveda</em> until 1598, when the inhabitants <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> it before the courts of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, in order to come under the Government of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Jaime I received its support in the conquest of Valencia, and the standards of Teruel were the first to wave in the gateway of Serranos. In 1271 it joined in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Castile, invaded Huete and Cuenca, and sided with Pedro IV in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the "Union". In recognition of this the king visited the city in 1348 and conferred upon it the title of <em>exenta</em> (exempt). <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> at the earnest solicitations of Philip II created the diocese in 1577. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Juan P&eacute;rez de Artieda, was elected but not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> installed was Andr&eacute;s Santos, who was transferred to Saragossa in 1579. All the churches of Teruel are contemporary with its foundation, as the founders built nine churches, one, Santa Maria de Media Villa, in the centre, and the remaining eight in a circle following the circuit of the walls. The central church, was made a collegiate church in 1423 and named the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1577. It was originally built of brick and rubblework, but since the restoration in the seventeenth century it has lost its primitive character. The Doric choir stalls were the gift of Martin Ferrer, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Teruel, and later of <a href="../cathen/14452a.htm">Tarazona</a>.

<p>Ferdinand and Isabella visited Teruel in 1482, took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and received the freedom of the city. The founding of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in 1484 produced serious changes because the converts were numerous and powerful. The inquisitor, Juan de Solivellia, was forced to leave. <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">Property</a> to the amount of 133,000 <em>sueldos</em> was confiscated and turned over to the city. The Churches of San Mart&iacute;n and El Salvador are remarkable for their Arabic towers. The first, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> in style, was built in the twelfth century. Pierre de Bedel, builder of the Arcos de Teruel (Aqueduct) and of the Mina de Daroca, repaired its foundations from 1549 to 1551. The tower of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of El Salvador, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> style of the thirteenth century, was reinforced in the nineteenth century by brick additions. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Pedro rest the bodies of the famous "lovers of Teruel", Diego Mart&iacute;nez de Marcilla and Isabel de Segura. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/14781a.htm">St. Toribio de Mogrovejo</a>, was founded by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Francisco Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez Chico, who after the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1769 was granted the use of their magnificent college by Charles III. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of independence and the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that followed, the building was taken over for military quarters and shortly afterwards the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was suppressed. It was re-established in 1849 by Don Antonio Lao y Cuevas, who gave his own palace for the purpose. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> has since been restored to the order. The episcopal palace is in no way remarkable except perhaps for its courtyard, which has a well-proportioned Ionic <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a>. The <em>Casa del Cap&iacute;tula</em>, where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chapter used to assemble, has an altar dedicated to the Immaculate Conception and to St. Emerentia, patroness of the city.

<p>Among the distinguished citizens of Teruel must be mentioned <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Jer&oacute;nimo Ripalda, S.J.</a>; the jurisconsult Gaspar de Castellot; Miguel Jer&oacute;nimo de Castellot, judge of the courts of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, 1665; Fray Juan Cebrian de Perales, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Albarracin, and Juan Mart&iacute;nez Salafranca, Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, founder of the Academy of History.
