<h1>Diocese of Valence</h1>  

<p>(VALENTINENSIS). <em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/15251a.htm">UNIVERSITY OF VALENCE</a>.

<p>Comprises the present Department of Drome. It was re-established by the Concordat of 1802, being formed of the ancient Diocese of Valence, less the portion comprised in the new <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Diocese of Viviers</a>, and of various portions of the Diocese of Die, Saint Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux, Vienne (see <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF LYONS</a>), Orange, <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a>, <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">Gap</a>, Sisteron (see <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">DIOCESE OF DIGNE</a>). From 1802 to 1821 Valence was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; since 1821 it has been dependent on <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>.
<h2>Ancient diocese of Valence</h2>

<p>A tradition of the early sixth century attributes the establishment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at Valentia to the three missionaries sent from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> by St. Iren&aelig;us; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> St. Felix and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> Sts. Achilles and Fortunatus, all <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The "Chronicles of the Bishops of Valence", probably compiled about the middle of the twelfth century, gives only confused information with regard to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> prior to the ninth century. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. &AElig;milianus (second half of the fourth century), who signed at the Council of Valence in 374. St. Sextus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> during the invasion of Chrocus, was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> introduced into the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Polycarpe de la Riviere. In 450 <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope St. Leo</a> made Valentia a suffragan of Vienne. St. Apollinaris, brother of <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a>, occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for thirty-four years during the first half of the sixth century, and after the conversion of Sigismund, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, was exiled by the latter; he is the patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Maximus II (567), during whose episcopate the city was delivered from besieging Lombards by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/06348a.htm">St. Galla</a>, a virgin of Bourg-les-Valence; Gontard (1082), who received <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> at Valence, 1095; St. John I (1141-6), formerly a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bonnevaux, disciple of St. Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>; Bl. Humbert de Miribel (1200-20); G&eacute;rold (1220-27), formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, later <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <a href="../cathen/02672a.htm">St. Boniface of Savoy</a> (1240-42), later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; Amadeus II, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Saluces (1383-89); John VI, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine (1521); Francois-Guillaume de Castelnau, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Clermont-Lod&egrave;ve (1524-31); Jean de Montluc, brother of the historian Blaise, who assisted in the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the Duke of Anjou as King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1553-79), and was suspected of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> tendencies. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Valence recognized only the sovereignty of the emperor, as King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Arles; under him the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> exercised real dominion. The neighbouring territories bore the title of Countship and Duchy of Valentinois. In 950 Gontard, of the house of the counts of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, made himself master of the Countship of Valentinois, which passed to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> in 1419, and to the Dauphin Louis, son of Charles VII, in 1446, becoming united to the Crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1498 Louis XII made Valentinois a ducal peerage which he gave to Caesar Borgia.
<h2>Diocese of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux</h2>

<p>According to a legend of the fifteenth century, St. Restitutus, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux, was the man born blind, mentioned in the Gospel. Local traditions also make Sts. Eusebuis, Torquatus, Paulus, Amantius, Sulpicius, Bonifatius, Castorinus, and Michael early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux. Mgr. Duchesne regards St. Paulus (fourth or sixth century), patron of the city, as the only known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Owing to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> ravages (827-29) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a>, was united with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Orange until the end of the eleventh century, when the Diocese of Orange was re-established. The Diocese of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux was always dependent on Arles. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Heraclius (525-42), correspondent of <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a>; Saint Martin des Ormeaux (seventh century), who became a solitary.
<h2>Diocese of Die</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Polycarpe de la Riviere gives St. Martinus (220) as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die. The oldest historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is St. Nicasius, who attended the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325. After him are mentioned: <a href="../cathen/11782a.htm">St. Petronius</a>, followed by his brother St. Marcellus (c. 463), confessor and <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracle-worker</a>; Lucretius (541-73), to whom St. Ferreolus of Uzes dedicated his monastic rule. For various reasons Abb&eacute; Jules Chevalier omits from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list: St. Maximus (sixth century); Wulphinus (end of eighth century); Exuperius and Saturninus (ninth century). Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Hugh (1073-83), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the latter, presided over numerous councils for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and subsequently became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; St. Ismido (1098-1115) of the noble house of Sassenage; Bl. Uric (1129-42), who opposed the <a href="../cathen/11781a.htm">Petrobrusian heresy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and became a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>; Bl. Bernard (1173-76); St. Stephen (1203-8), formerly a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Portes; Bl. Didier (Desiderius) de Lans (1213-20). After the eleventh century the Diocese of Die, long disputed between the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Vienne and Arles, became dependent on Vienne. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 25 September, 1275, in order to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Valence in its struggle with the House of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> united the Diocese of Die with that of Valence. This union, which lasted four centuries, was unfortunate for Die. It was annulled in 1687 by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, who, to combat <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die.

<p>Councils were held at Valence in: 374, at which measures were taken for <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>; 530, against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>; 585, King Gontran's donations to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were confirmed; 855, against <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk's</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; 890, Louis, son of Boson, was proclaimed King of Provence; 1100, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> was suspended as a <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniac</a>; 1209, dealt with the conditions on which the Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> should be admitted to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. A so-called Council of Valence, held at Montelimar (1248), <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> and organized the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Notre-Dame-d'Aiguebelle, which was founded in 1045 through Hughues Adhemar, Baron de Grignan, and visited by Paschal II in 1107, subsequently fell to decay. In 1137 the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of Morimond were summoned by Gontard Dupuy, Lord of Rochefort, to found a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the neighbourhood of the first. From the end of the fifteenth century it belonged to commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Since 1816, when Pierre-Francois de Paul Malmy (Pere Etienne), a <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a>, secured possession of it, there has been a <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> congregation at the Abbey d'Aiguebelle. The <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of Sts. Rufus, founded at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1039, opened at Valence in 1158 a house which became their mother house in 1210, were secularized in 1774. Among the canons were: Anastasius IV, <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were: May (Marius), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bodon (d. 550); Barnard (778-842), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, who became a solitary at Romans, where he founded a large <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> which still stands; Hugh (1053-1132), formerly a canon of Valence and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, one of the founders of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>; Hugh, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Lioncel, nephew of the preceding (twelfth century), Blessed Bertrand of Garrigue, companion of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Saint Dominic</a>, died at Bouchet in the Diocese of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux during a mission (1230); <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Blessed Humbert of Romans</a>, general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, author of <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings, died at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Valence (1277). Adh&eacute;mar de Monteil, a native of Grignan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, was accompanied on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> by Bernard of Valence, first patriarch of Antioch in the new <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>, and by Raymond des Agiles, a native of St-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux, one of the historians of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. Marie Teyssonnier, called Marie de Valence (1576-1648), had such a reputation for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal de Berulle</a>, <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, <a href="../cathen/04422b.htm">Father Cotton</a>, and Louis XIII visited her. Christophe d'Authier de Sigaud (1609-67), founder in 1632 of the Congregation of Missionary Priests of the Blessed Sacrament, founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1639.

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> warriors played an important part in the history of this region: Margu&eacute;rite de Laye triumphantly led the inhabitants of Mont&eacute;limar against the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> troops of Coligny; Philis de la Tour du Pin la Charce in 1696 successfully led the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and the neighbouring communes against the invasion of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, the famous writer of letters, died in 1696 in the Chateau de Grignan which belonged to her son-in-law. At Romans Gambretta delivered a famous discourse (18 Sept., 1878) in which he outlined the whole anti-clerical policy of the Third Republic. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Valence a Requiem Mass is sung yearly on 29 August, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, who died at Valence, 29 August, 1799, during his confinement in the citadel. The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Combe at St-Germain d'Hauterives, dating from the twelfth century; Notre-Dame-de Chatenay at Lens-Lestang; Notre-Dame-de Consolation at Arpavon; Notre-Dame-de-Mont-Carmel at Chateauneuf-de-Mazenc; Notre-Dame-la Blanche at Mollans.

<p>Before the application of the Associations Law of 1901 there were at Valence: <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/11187a.htm">Oblates of St. Francis de Sales</a>, and various orders of teaching <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Brothers</a>.

<p>Several orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are native to the diocese: Trinitarians, nursing and teaching sisters, established at Valence since 1695; Sisters of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and teaching sisters, founded by Father Vigne, a convert, with mother-house at Romans, 1715; the teaching Sisters of St. Martha, founded in 1815 by Mlle du Vivier with mother-house at Romans; Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, founded by Baroness de Mont-Rond and Abb&eacute; N&eacute;e in 1851 for the supervision of work-rooms and studios, with mother-house at Recoubeau. At the end of the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders had in the Diocese of Valence: 28 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 institution for deaf-mutes, 1 infirmary for dependent children, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys, 15 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 3 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 protective <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, 3 reformatories, 12 houses of religious for the care of the sick in their homes, 1 asylum for idiots and epileptics, 10 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In 1905 the diocese had: 297,321 inhabitants, 37 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 314 succursals, 68 vicariates. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Jean-Victor-Emile Chesnelong, b. at Orthez, 6 April, 1856, studied at Saint-Sulpice, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1879, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 25 Feb., 1906.
