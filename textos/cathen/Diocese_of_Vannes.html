<h1>Diocese of Vannes</h1>  

<p>(VENETENSIS).

<p>Comprises the Department of Morbihan, and was re-established by the Concordat of 1802; it was formed: (1) from the former Diocese of Vannes, excluding the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> situated east of the Oust River, which were annexed to the <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Archdiocese of Rennes</a>; (2) from the District of Roce-Bernard, detached from the <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>; (3) from the southern part of the former Diocese of St. Malo; (4) from the District of Gourin, detached from the <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Diocese of Quimper</a>. It was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> until 1859 and, since that time, of <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>. The Department of Morbihan is that part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where the greatest number of monuments of the old Gallic worship are preserved; the long avenues of menhirs at Carnac are famous.

<p>According to tradition, St. Clair, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, died in the third century during the course of his preaching in the Diocese of Vannes. The synodical epistle of the Council of Angers, on 4 October, 453, gives the names of four Breton <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, one of whom was certainly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vannes. St. Paternus, whose origin is much discussed by hagiographers, and who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> between 461 and 490, is the chief patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. No document previous to the Charter of Quimperl&eacute;, which dates from the twelfth century, gives as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Vannes, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> Doininius, Clemens, Amans, Saturninus, Guinninus (Guenin), Vigorocus, Budocus, Hinguethenus, Meriadocus, Meldrocus, Comeanus, and Justocus who probably, without episcopal character, were engaged in evangelizing the country. Bishop Susannus was expelled from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by the Breton king Nominoe (8484) because the latter wished to reorganize <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Brittany. Among the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are mentioned: Pierre de Foix (1476-90), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1476; Cardinal Laurent Pucci (1514-31); Cardinal Antoine* Pucci (1531-44); Charles de Marillac (150-60), ambassador of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in Turkey and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>St. Gildas "the Wise", or "Badonicus", born in Great Britain in 494, left there about 527, went to the Island of Houat, then to the Peninsula of Rhuis, where he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a>, and wrote two treatises which are a valuable source for the ancient history of the Britons; he died in 570. In the tenth century, the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> destroyed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, then under the Abbot Dave. Abbot Dave brought the bodies of Saints Patricius, Albon, and Paternus to Bourg Deols in Berri, and there erected a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a>. In 1008, Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany, asked Gauzlin, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint Benoit on the Loire, for religious to re-establish the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a> of Rhuis. It was re-established by Abbot Felix, who died in 1038. <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rhuis in 125, soon left the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but retained the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> until his death. Eudes de Kerlivio d'Hennebond, disciple of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and Father Huby, S.J., contributed greatly to the religious revival of the Diocese of Vannes, by the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1681). In the fourteenth century, during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in which Venerable Charles of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> supported by Charles V and Jean de Montfort, aided by the English, contested the sovereignty of Brittany, Vannes was several times besieged. The battle of Auray (29 September, 1364), in which Venerable Charles of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> was killed, put an end to the struggle between the two <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> and of Montfort. An army of <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em>, commanded by Puisaye, Sombreuil, and d'Hervilly, landed, June, 1795, on the Peninsula of Quiberon, was there joined by 10,000 Chouans, and was attacked by Hoche, who completely annihilated it, 16 July, 1795. Herc&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dol, was shot at Vannes by the Republican troops, on 3 July, 1795; 900 <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em>, who had landed at Quiberon, were shot at Blech, near Auray; their bones are kept at the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Auray, the ancient collegiate church founded in the fourteenth century by Jean de Montfort.

<p>Councils were held at Vannes in 461 or 465, 818, 846. The Viscountship of Rohan, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was erected in 1603, by Henri IV, into a duchy-peerage for Henri de Rohan (1574-1638), who became one of the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party under Louis XIII. A certain number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are connected with the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: St. Eguiner or Guyomard (Guignerus), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> at Ploudery in 499; St. Albinus (Aubin), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a> from 529 to 549, native of the Diocese of Vannes; St. Salomon, Duke or King of the Bretons, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (ninth century); St. Goustan (Sulstanus), <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a>, d. about 1009; St. Vincent Ferrer (1357-1419), who died at Vannes, where he is buried, is patron of the episcopal city; Blessed Francoise d'Amboise, Duchess of Brittany, who, having become a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, refuse the brilliant marriage which Louis XI suggested to her, founded the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of Vannes, and died in 1485. The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de Larmor; Notre-Dame de Queleven, at Guern; Notre-Dame du Roncier, at Josselin; Notre-Dame du Voeu, at Hennebont; and above all the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Saint Anne d'Auray. From the earliest centuries, Brittany had erected a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to Saint Anne; it was destroyed at the close of the eighth century, but popular tradition forbade the sowing of the field of Bocenno, where the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> had been erected. In 1623 and 1624, after visions, the farmer Yves Nicolazic obtained from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> permission for a new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The image of St. Anne, which was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there, was burned in 1793; but a new statute of Saint Anne was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by order of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 30 September, 1868.

<p>Before the application of the Law of 1901 to the congregations, there were in the Diocese of Vannes, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, Picpusiens, Fathers of the Holy Spirit and of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and lay Brothers of St. Francis Regis. The powerful <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Christian Instruction</a> had its mother-house at Ploermel, in the diocese. Many communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were originally of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis, hospitallers and teachers, founded in 1803 by Mme de Malesherbes, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the defender of Louis XVI, and her daughter Mme Mol&eacute;, with the mother-house at Vannes; the <a href="../cathen/08374a.htm">Daughters of Jesus</a>, with the mother-house at Kermaria. At the end of the nineteenth century, the religious congregations conducted in the Diocese of Vannes: 2 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylums</a>; 44 day nurseries; 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf mutes; 3 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> for boys; 8 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> for girls; 4 industrial rooms; 1 home for unprotected young girls; 18 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or refuges; more than 150 houses of religious for the care of the sick at their homes; 1 insane asylum. The Diocese of Vannes had in 1905 (at the end of the administration of the Concordat): 563,468 inhabitants; 38 livings; 238 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 279 vicariates, recompensed by the State.
