<h1>Diocese of Verdun</h1>  

<p>(VIRODUNENSIS.)

<p>Comprises the Department of the Meuse. Suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, and subsequently united to the <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Diocese of Nancy</a>, Verdun was re-established by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 27 July, 1817, and by the Royal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 31 October, 1822. It was formed practically of the entire ancient Diocese of Verdun, portions of the ancient Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, Toul, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and became suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Archdiocese of Besan&ccedil;on</a>. For the late tradition attributing the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Verdun to St. Sanctinus, disciple of St. Denis the Areopagite, after he had founded the Church of Meaux, see <a href="../cathen/16062b.htm">MEAUX</a>. Certain local traditions state that Sts. Maurus, Salvinus, and Arator were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Verdun after St. Sanctinus, but the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history is St. Polychronius (Pulchrone) who lived in the fifth century and was a relative and disciple of St. Lupus de Troyes. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> worthy of mention are: St. Possessor (470-86); St. Firminus (486-502); Vitonus (Vanne) (502-29); St. D&eacute;sir&eacute; (Desideratus) (529-54), St. Agricus (Airy) (554-91), friend of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a>; St. Paul (630-48), formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of Tholey in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a>; and St. Madalvaeus (Mauve) (753-76). The legend according to which Peter, successor of Madalvaeus, received the Diocese of Verdun from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> as a reward for the cession of the town of Pavia or Treviso to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, is no longer accepted. Peter became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verdun in 781, named to that office by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> at the request of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; shortly afterwards he was accused of conspiring against the emperor but was cleared of the accusation at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (794). Bishop Dado (880-923) caused the "Gesta episcoporum Virodunensium" to be begun by Bertharius, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of Saint-Vanne, afterwards continued down to 1250 by Lawrence, another <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Saint-Vanne, and later by an anonymous writer.

<p>Verdun, which had been originally a Roman <em>civitas</em>, shared the destiny of Lorraine in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and formed part of Lower Lorraine. The counts of Verdun belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ardennes of which <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>, the hero of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>, was an illustrious member. The Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> in 997 conferred on Bishop Haymon of Verdun and his successors the titles of counts of their episcopal city and princes of the Holy Roman Empire with all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereigns, especially that of naming for life a count subject to the commands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>Comte viager</em>). These "episcopal counts" also called <em>vou&eacute;s</em> (<em>advocati</em>) continued to be selected by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Verdun from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Ardennes, and there were frequent quarrels between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the vou&eacute;s. Thus <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>, Vou&eacute; of Verdun, was in conflict with Thierry the Great, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verdun from 1047 to 1088, before leaving for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">Crusade</a>, and renounced his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the countship. During the first half of the twelfth century, Renauld le Borgne, Count de Bar and Vou&eacute; of Verdun, governed the town as a tyrant and resisted the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for thirty-five years. The feast entitled "Commemoration of the Miracles of the Virgin Mary" is celebrated in the diocese on 20 October, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the final victory of Bishop Albero (1131-56) over "le Borgne" to whom the former ceded Clermontois and Vienne-le-Ch&acirc;teau. From this time the vou&eacute;s of Verdun were suppressed. The concessions obtained from the Emperor Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1227 by the people of Verdun were the cause of a two-years' <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between them and Bishop Raoul de Torote (1224-45). Jacques de Troyes, later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verdun from 1252-1255. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: Li&eacute;bauld de Cusance (1379-1403), who signed a treaty with King Charles VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by which French dominion was established in Verdun; Cardinal Louis de Bar (1419-30); Guillaume de Fillastre (1437-49), historian of the Golden Fleece (<em>Toison d'Or</em>); and Cardinal Jean de Lorraine (1523-44). <a href="../cathen/12544a.htm">Nicolas Psaulme</a> (1548-75) successfully withstood the inroads of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the diocese. At the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> he vigorously attacked the system of commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. It was during his episcopate that the Constable de Montmorency conquered in the name of Henry II, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the "Three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a>" of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun (1552), though theoretically they remained territories of the empire until the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> in 1648. Other incumbents of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were Charles de Lorraine, Cardinal de Vaudemont (1585-87), and Eric de Lorraine Vaudemont (1593-1610) to whom, at the end of 1603, after many difficulties, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> gave full power to legalize the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Henry, heir to the Duchy of Lorraine, to his <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> cousin Catherine, sister of Henry IV.



<p>Under the old regime the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Verdun were suffragans of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> visited Verdun to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on 11 November, 1147. This <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built at the order of Bishop Albero by the architect Garin, its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> being a masterpiece of flamboyant Gothic, built from 1509 to 1517. The Abbey of Tholey was given in 634 to the church of Verdun by the rich <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Adalgisus, its founder, out of esteem for his friend Bishop Paul. Until the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> it was the chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Verdun. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Vasloge, later Beaulieu, founded in 642 by St. Rouyn, numbered among its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> in the eleventh century Blessed Richard (d. 1046), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Vanne, who reformed it, and St. Poppon, who died in 1048. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Saint-Vanne de Verdun was founded in 952 to replace a community which had established in the same church by St. Vitonus. Among the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Saint-Vanne may be mentioned the aforesaid Blessed Richard, who dissuaded the Emperor St. Henry from becoming a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Saint-Vanne when he came to Verdun for that purpose about the year 1024; also Abbot Conon, who played an important part in the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">conflict of investitures</a>, and who died in 1178. For the important monastic reforms of the beginning of the seventeenth century, which, thanks to the prior Dom Didier de la Cour, emanated from the Abbey of Saint-Vanne, see <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">BENEDICTINE ORDER</a>. The superb Church of Saint-Vanne was destroyed in 1832 and its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, which had been converted into barracks, was burned in 1870. The Abbey of Saint-Paul de Verdun was founded (970-973) by Bishop Viefrid. It was originally occupied by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, but in 1135 by <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, and was finally destroyed in 1552. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Saint-Airy de Verdun, founded between 1025 and 1042, opened public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> about the year 1100, which enjoyed renown for a number of years. In 709 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> dedicated to <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> was established on Mount de Ch&acirc;tillon by Vulfoad, mayor of the palace under Childeric, King of Austrasia. Abbot Maragdus, a friend of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, transferred it in 819 to the borders of the Meuse, thus founding the town of Saint-Mihiel. The reform inaugurated by the congregation of Saint Vanne was introduced into this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1606 by Cardinal Charles de Lorraine, one of its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Cardinal de Retz was also an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Saint-Mihiel and occupied the castle of Commercy, where he wrote his "Memoirs on the Fronde", and which castle he restored and afterwards sold to Charles IV of Lorraine.

<p>The castle and town of Vaucouleurs belonged to the lords of Joinville, one of whom wrote the life of St. Louis. At this town <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> presented herself to Robert de Baudricout, offering her services against the English who were then besieging Orl&eacute;ans. Before the foundation of the Fortress of Montmedy there existed, on the rock dominating the town, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> under the protection of the Blessed Virgin which in the sixth century had replaced a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Gaulish Mercury. The Diocese of Verdun figures largely in the history of art, owing to the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Ligier Richier (1500-72), a pupil of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. His mausoleum of Rene de <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, Prince of Orange, at Bar-le-Duc and his Holy Sepulchre in the church of Saint-Mihiel are admirable works of art. A council held at Verdun in 947 dealt with the conflict between Hugues and Artaud both of whom claimed the See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, finally retained by Artaud. At Tusey (Tusiacum) near Vaucouleurs, a council, convened by Charles the Bald and Lothaire, was held in 860. The synodal letter despatched by the council and revised by <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>, dealt with usurpers of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> and maintained against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died for all men without exception. The Treaty of Verdun signed in 843 by the three Kings, Lothaire, Charles the Bald, and Louis the German, definitively confirmed the division of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> empire. A number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are connected with the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of whom the following are worthy of mention: St. Euspicius, who during the siege of Verdun in 502 by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, prevailed on him to spare the town and received the territory of Micy near Orl&eacute;ans on which to build an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; he was an uncle of St. Vanne (Vitonus), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verdun, and of St. Mesmin (Maximinus) from whom the Abbey of Micy received its name. St. Wandrille (Wandregesilus), b. in Verdun in 570, founder of the Monastery of Fontenelle and his nephew St. Gou, also born in Verdun and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Fontenelle; St. Rouyn (Rodingus) of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin, who founded the Abbey of Beaulieu in the episcopate of St. Paul and died in 708 at the age of 117; also Blessed Pierre of Luxembourg (1369-1387), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, son of Gui de Luxembourg, Count de Ligny. <a href="../cathen/06471a.htm">Father Gerbillon</a> (1634-1707), a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, who played an important part in the Chinese Missions, came originally from Verdun, and the celebrated and learned <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Dom Calmet</a> (1672-1757) was born at Mesnil la Horgne.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame d'Avioth, near Montm&eacute;dy, dating from the twelfth century, with a sanctuary <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourteenth to the fifteenth centuries; Notre Dame de Benoite Vaux; Notre Dame de la Belle Epine, at Bouchon; Notre Dame du Guet, at Bar-le-Duc, dating from 1130; Notre Dame des Vertus, at Ligny; St. Anne d'Argonne, dating from 1338; and Notre Dame of La Vo&ucirc;te at Vaucouleurs. Before the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 regarding the associations, the following orders were represented in the Diocese of Verdun: <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>; <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> of our Saviour and several orders of teaching brothers. Among orders for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were: <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canonesses Regular of St. Augustine</a> of the Congregation of Our Lady, founded at Corbeil (Seine et Oise) in 1643, in 1816 they were charged with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> of the daughters of the Chevaliers de St. Louis and were transferred to Verdun in 1839; also the Sisters of Compassion, a teaching order founded in 1846 with a mother-house at St-Hilaire-en-Woevre. At the end of the nineteenth century the religious congregations directed: 64 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> for girls, 2 houses of charity, 1 dispensary, 3 houses for nursing the sick in their homes, 1 house of retreat, 1 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a>, and 18 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In 1905 at the end of the concordatory regime there were 283,480 inhabitants, 30 first-class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 444 succursals and 34 vicariates.
