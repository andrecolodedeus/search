<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Diocese of Veroli</h1>  

<p>(VERULANA).

<p>Located in the Province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The city of Veroli (Verulae) is situated on the crest of the Hernican Mountains, at the elevation of 1640 feet above the sea level, with the River Cora running beneath it. Its antiquity is evidenced by the remains of Pelargic walls. Upon the loftiest portion stand the ruins of a very ancient castle which served as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">John X</a>. The textile industry, which still flourished in the middle of the nineteenth century, is now reduced to very small portions. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and episcopal palace received their present form from Bishop Ennio Filonardi in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Some very precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and documents are preserved in the archives of the chapter, among them the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tolosa. Adjoining the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the Church of St. Salome, whose body is believed to be preserved there. S. Erasmo still retains its Gothic <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a>, though its interior has been entirely transformed. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, the gift of Bishop Vittorio Giovardi, who had the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> rebuilt in 1753. At the same period a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, founded as early as 1538, was combined with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>Veroli was a city of the Hernici, and thus was allied with the Romans against the Volsei; remaining so during the Samnite War, it was able to preserve its autonomy. In 872 it was taken by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. In 1144 Roger I besieged it in vain. It served as a place of retreat for <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. A memorable event in its history was the meeting which took place there between <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> Giovanni Sulpizio and Aonio Palcario (Antonio Pagliari), the latter burned in 1570 for his writings in support of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, were natives of Veroli. The city boasts of having received the light of the Gospel from St. Mary Salome, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, it is said, were discovered in 1209 through a vision sen by one Thomas. Nevertheless, no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is known before Martinus (743). The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Blasius and Demetrius are still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> there. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> worthy of mention are Agostino (1106) and Faramondo (1160), who had been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Casamari; Giovanni (1223), the restorer of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> discipline; Ennio Filonardi (1503), who was distinguished in the nunciature; Gerolamo Asteo (1608) a Conventual, founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and author of many works, mostly unpublished; Domenico de Zaulis (1690), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and other churches; Antonio Rossi (1786), who, with his whole chapter, took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It has 37 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 7000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 100 secular and 100 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 10 houses of male religious, 11 of sisters; 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 5 for girls.
