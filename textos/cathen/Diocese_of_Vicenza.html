<h1>Diocese of Vicenza</h1>  

<p>(VICENTINA).

<p>The city is the capital of a province in Venetia (Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The surrounding country is agricultural, but there are also quarries of marble, sulphur, copper, and silver mines, and beds of lignite and kaolin; mineral springs also abound, the most famous being those of Recoaro. Among the industries worthy of mention are the woollen and silk, pottery, and musical instruments. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dating from early in the eleventh century, and restored in the thirteenth, sixteenth, and nineteenth, possesses numerous pictures and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, nearly all of them by Vicentine artists (Cittadello, Celestia, Liberi, Ruschi). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Ara Coeli (1244), formerly belonging to the Clarisses, contains <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> by Marinali and Cassetti, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/14723a.htm">Tiepolo</a>. The Churches of the Carmine (1372) and S. Caterina (1292), formerly belonging to the <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>, possess notable pictures. S. Corona (1260) was built by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> after the death of Ezzelino, and is pictures by <a href="../cathen/10511b.htm">Montagna</a> ("The Magdelene") and Relline ("Baptism of Christ"). Other churches are: S. Croce (1179), SS. Felice e Fortunato (eighth century), SS. Filippo e Giacomo (twelfth century), S. Lorenzo of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> (1280), in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of many illustrious Vicentines. In the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of S. Maria of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> (1319) took place the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of St. Philip Benizi de Damiani. The most remarkable secular buildings are the theatre, built by <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a> in 15890 for the Accademia degli Olimpici, and the Basilica--the building itself Gothic of 1444, though <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a> built the outer portico in two orders. Near the latter are the clock tower (1224-1446), 268 feet in height, and the Rotondo, another work of <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio's</a> (1570), with four porticoes. There are numerous private palaces which were transformed by <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a> and his pupils. A special feature is the multitude of towers which still remain. The Communal Library was founded by Count Giovanni M. Bertolo. The Museum contains a picture-gallery exclusively devoted to Vicentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. Of the philanthropic institutions many, like the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, date back to the fourteenth century, others to the fifteenth.

<p>Vicentia was a city of the Veneti, from whom it was taken by the Gauls. In Roman times it was of little importance, though it had the franchise in 45 B.C. It suffered by the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> and the Huns, but is not mentioned in connection with the Gothic War. In the eighth century we find a Lombard Duke of Vicenza. When the Othos handed over the government of the city to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, its communal organization had an opportunity to develop, and separated itself from the episcopal authority. It took an active part in the Lombard League, compelling Padua and Treviso to join, and its podesta, Ezzelino III, il Balbo, was captain of the league. When peace was restored, however, the old rivalry with Padua, Bassano, and other cities was renewed, besides which there were the internal factions of the Vivaresi (Ghibellines) and the Maltraversi (Guelphs). The tyrannical Ezzelino IV drove the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> out of Vicenza, and caused his brother, Alberico, to be elected podesta (1230). The city joined the Second Lombard League against <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, and was sacked by that monarch (1237), after which it formed part of Ezzelino's dominions. On his death the old government was restored--a <em>consiglio maggiore</em> of four hundred members and a <em>consiglio minore</em> of forty members--and formed a league with Padua, <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. Three years later the Vicentines entrusted the protection of the city to <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, so as to safeguard republican liberty; but this protectorate (<em>custodia</em>) quickly became dominion, and for that reason Vicenza in 1311 <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> submitted to the Scaligeri of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. In 1404 it submitted to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and thenceforward shared the history of that republic. It was beseiged by the Emperor Sigismund, and Maximilian I held possession of it in 1509 and 1516. In 1848 it rose against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, but was recovered after a stubborn resistance. Vicenza was the native city of the historian Ferreto dei Ferreti (fourteenth century), the poet <a href="../cathen/15061a.htm">Trissino</a> (1478-1553), the traveller Pigafetta, companion of Magalhaes, the architects <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a> and Scamazzi, and the engraver Valerio Belli.

<p>Among its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saints</a> the city venerates St. Lontius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and Sts. Theodore and Apollonius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and confessors in the fourth century. The <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">Christian cemetery</a> discovered recently near the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Felix and Fortunatus, dates from the earlier half of the fourth century, and these two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were probably <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom there is any certain record is Horontius (590), a partisan of the Schism of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Vitalis (901), high chancellor of King <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>: Girolano (1000), deposed by Henry II for political sedition; Torengo, in whose episcopate a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> rebelled against the episcopal authority; Blessed Giovanni Ccciafronte (1179-85), a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, slain by one of his own vassals. Uberto was deposed by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> as a despoiler of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, but the canons put off until 1219 the election of his successor, Gilberto, who was forced by the tyranny of Ezzelino to live in exile. Blessed Bartolommeo da Breganze (1256), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, had previously been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11071c.htm">Nicosia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Under Bishop Emiliani (1409) took place the apparition of the Blessed Virgin on Monte Berico which led to the foundation of the famous sanctuary, 3280 feet above the sea level. Pietro Barbo (1451) was afterwards <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Pope Paul II</a>. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Zeno (1468) was distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning. Matteo Priuli (1563) founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and made efforts for reform. Alvise M. Ganrielli (1779) restored many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The See of Vicenza was suffragan of Aquilcia, then of <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a>, and since 1818 of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains: 219 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 477,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 699 secular and 39 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 10 houses of male religious and 52 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 52 for girls. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press comprises "Il Berico" (tri-weekly, Vicenza), "La Riscossa" (tri-weekly, Breganze), and six other periodicals.
