<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Diocese of Vich</h1>  

<p>(Vicensis, Ausonensis).

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, bounded on the north by Gerona, on the east by Gerona and Barcelona, on the south by Barcelona and Tarragona, on the west by Tarragona and <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>. It lies within the four Catalonian provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona. The capital has 9500 inhabitants. Vich is of very ancient origin; it was called Ausa by the Romans, and Iberian <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bearing this name have been found there. The <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> called it Ausona. After its destruction by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> only one quarter (Vicus) was rebuilt, and this was called Vicus Ausonensis, from which the name Vich was derived. The introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was undoubtedly very remote, as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Ausa are recorded in the time of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian sees the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vich is one of the very first mentioned. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> and <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>. Aquilinus (589-99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at Egara; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ends the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> of Ausona before the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasion. The reconquest of Vich was begun in the time of Louis the Pious, who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters being under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne. In 826 Vich fell once more into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and was finally reconquered by Wilfred the Hairy, independent Count of Barcelona.

<p>Wilfred dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ripoli, which was already in existence in 888, and obtained form the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Godmarus as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vich. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Moncada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when the Bishop Berenguer Gaguardia ceded his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the king, James II, who also purchased the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Moncadas. It is disputed whether the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Pedro Ap&oacute;stol or S. Maria la Rotonda was the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. For centuries the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> celebrated the first <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> Mass in this church, and the third in that of San Pedro. The very ancient Church of S. Maria was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillermo Bonfil in 1140, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> forty years later by Bishop Pedro Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jorge (915- 38) reconsecrated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ripoli and also <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> that of S. Maria de Manresa. Bishop Atton (960-72) is worthy of mention as a great promoter of studies. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, afterwards Pope Sylvester II, who was distinguished for his learning. Another of the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Vich was Oliva (1018-46), son of the Count of Besahi, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ripoli where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January, 1032. He also, with the help of Ermesinda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and dedicated it to Sts. Peter and Paul on 31 August, 1038. In the time of his successor Guillermo I the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saints</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vich, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Berenguer Seniofredo reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, which was contested by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Narbonne. Among the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who attended the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vich, who was accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Pedro Mercado.

<p>Of the more recent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Jos&eacute; Morgades y Gili deserves special mention. He restored the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ripoli, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July, 1893. He also established at Vich an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vich is Jos&eacute; Torras y Bages, a man of great culture and learning. The greatest glory of Vich of modern times is <a href="../cathen/02224b.htm">Jaime Balmes</a>, the foremost <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of the nineteenth century, whose remains are <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His first centenary was celebrated at Vich by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress. The original <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had but a single <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the thirteenth century Bishop Raimundo de Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, and in 1585 the door of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognized, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the building was torn down, and the corner stone of the new one was laid on 24 September, 1781. It was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 15 September, 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of white stone enriched with a beautiful balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, and colossal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> which is of alabaster, in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, and was given early in the fifteen century by D. Bernardo Despujol. Among the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> that of S. Bernardo Calvo (1233-43), who assisted Jaime I in the conquest of Valencia, deserves special mention. The two-storied Gothic <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> is exceedingly beautiful. A handsome Gothic doorway leading to the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a> has been preserved.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, by Manuel Munoz in 1748. The present <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is located in the former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>. It has sent out many famous men, among them <a href="../cathen/02224b.htm">Balmes</a> and the poet Mos&eacute;n Jacinto Verdager, author of "La Atlantida". The episcopal palace was destroyed in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of 1640 and rebuilt by degrees, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building. the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Vich never attained to any great importance; it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when or by whom it was founded. Philip III granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the arts (1599). Philip V, in the Cortes of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and other higher <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Manresa, where <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a> wrote his Spiritual, is situated in the Diocese of Vich. His memory is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the Santa Cueva, which has been converted into a church, and a magnificent college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> built near it. Among the celebrated natives of Vich should be mentioned the Trinitarian St. Miguel de los Santos and Padre Claret, confessor of Isabella II and founder of the Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
