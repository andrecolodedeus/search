<h1>Diocese of Wichita</h1>  

<p>(WICHITENSIS).

<p>Erected in 1887, from the <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Diocese of Leavenworth</a>. The territory of the new see was bounded on the east by the sixth principal meridian, south by the Indian Territory, west by <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, and north by the northern lines of Greeley, <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, Scott, Lanes, Ness, Rush, Barton, Rice, and MacPherson Counties in the <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">State of Kansas</a>. At that time there were 16 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in charge of churches, and 23 churches attended as missions; 9 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 of which were taught by the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, and 1 by the <a href="../cathen/03609a.htm">Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a> (Dubuque). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbered about 8000, but there were no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in the diocese. In 1897 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> attached fourteen additional counties located east of the sixth principal meridian, the eastern boundary being the West line of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a>, and continuing the north line of the Indian Territory on the South. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed for this Diocese, Rt. Rev. James O'Reilly, of Topeka, <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, died on 26 July, 1887, before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. One year later, the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rt. Rev. John Joseph Hennessy, was selected, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 30 Nov., 1888, in St. John's Church, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, of which he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was performed by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of St. Louis, assisted by Bishop Hennessy of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, and Fink of <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Leavenworth</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> took over, his territory was in a very discouraging condition owing to a succession of years of drought and crop failures. Many settlers abandoned their farms and availed themselves of the opening of the new Territory of Oklahoma. Since then, the Kansas portion of what had been formerly known as the Great American Desert has improved under better methods of farming, and is now justly described as the garden spot of the West. The City of <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, called after an <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian</a> tribe, had a population of about 20,000 when established as an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>; it now numbers over 60,000 and is the largest and most thrifty city in Kansas, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>. It has four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches with about 3700 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 3 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attended by nearly 400 children, one academy for young ladies with 175 boarders, one industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for small children with 120 boarders, one <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> with 125 patients daily, one <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> with 30 inmates, one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>.
<h2>Diocesan statistics</h2>

<p>There are 76 secular and 12 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 69 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, 58 missions with churches, 7 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 35 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 2400 pupils, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Population of 32,000. There are 4 religious institutes of men: the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers at St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Wichita, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Marienthal, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Silvestrine Benedictines</a> at Chicopee for work especially among the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. There are six religious institutes of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> (diocesan), <a href="../cathen/03609a.htm">Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a> (Dubuque); <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (diocesan), <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a> (Diocesan); Sisters of the Precious Blood (Belleville), and Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother (Rome, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). A magnificent Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Bedford stone and granite was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1912 by His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>.
