<h1>Diocese of Wilmington</h1>  

<p>(WILMINGTONIENSIS).

<p>Erected 3 March, 1868. It includes what is known as the Delmarvia Peninsula, the Sate of Delaware, nine counties of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and two counties of <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> east of Chesapeake Bay. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission in this territory was founded at <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> Manor, Cecil Co., <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, in 1704 by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who were the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on the peninsula until 1808, when Rev. Patrick Kenny came to reside at Coffee Run, Delaware (see <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">DELAWARE</a>). The first church in the city of Wilmington was St. Peter's (1808), now the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Rt. Rev. Thomas A. Becker</a>, before his election a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, Virginia. He found in the new diocese only eight <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and fourteen churches, most of these scarcely more than sheds. St. Peter's Orphanage and St. Peter's School were in charge of the Sisters of Charity, two more <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had recently been closed, and the sisters withdrawn to Philadelphia. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the whole diocese did not exceed 5000. By constant and untiring effort in the face of extreme poverty, scarcity of vocations, and many other difficulties, <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Bishop Becker</a> increased the number of churches to twenty-six and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to twenty-one. He brought to the diocese the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> fathers, the Sisters of St. Francis (Glen Riddle, Pa.), and the Sisters of the Visitation. He also founded an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for boys. During his episcopate the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population increased to about 18,000.

<p>In 1886 <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Bishop Becker</a> was transferred to <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and was succeeded by Rev. Alfred A. Curtis, at that time chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Archdiocese of Baltimore</a>. Bishop Curtis was born on 4 July, 1831, in Somerset Co., <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and was therefore a native of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was reared as an Episcopalian, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the ministry of that church. As such he was stationed a short time at Chestertown, Kent Co., <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, in his future diocese. In 1872 he visited <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>. Returning he entered St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Archbishop Bayley, 19 Dec., 1874. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wilmington of 14 Nov., 1886. To pay off numerous <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> contracted in the rapid extension of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by his predecessor and to provide labourers and means to continue the work was a task that called for unusual <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy. Yet so well did he fulfil it that in the ten years of his episcopate the number of churches was increased by thirteen and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by eight. He established a mission for coloured people, placing the Josephite Fathers in charge. He also brought to the diocese the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a>. One of his chief works is the Visitation Monastery, which he built and had endowed in order that the sisters might become exclusively contemplative according to the primitive rule of their order. He died on 14 July, 1908, and, at his own request his remains were buried within the enclosure of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1896 Bishop Curtis resigned, leaving the diocese with 39 churches served by 29 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and with four communities of teaching sisters, 1 contemplative community, 3 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 25,000.

<p>The third and present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the Rt. Rev. John J. Monaghan. He was born 23 May, 1856, at Sumter, <a href="../cathen/14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at St. Charles College, Ellicott City, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 19 Dec., 1880, and served at various posts in the <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Diocese of Charleston</a> until his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at St. Peter's Pro-Cathedral on 9 May, 1897. Under his administration the growth of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has continued. Among the most notable of his acts are the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/11187a.htm">Oblate Fathers of St. Francis de Sales</a> (1903) and the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> (1903). The former conduct a day college for boys, while the latter care for the aged poor. The churches already in existence have been remodelled, new buildings provided for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, four new churches added in the country and two in the city, a residence for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was purchased, and all placed on a prosperous footing during this administration. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> continues, not with the strides of those <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> where immigration is large, but, if slowly, yet surely. Over eighty per cent of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is in Wilmington and its neighbourhood. The foreign elements are found here almost exclusively. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with a single exception, are in or around the city. The remainder of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is still a missionary district, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are few and scattered, and some churches are visited only once a month. In the whole diocese the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> form less than nine per cent of the population.
