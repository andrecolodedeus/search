<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Diocese of Winona</h1>  

<p>(WINONENSIS).

<p>Established in 1889, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, comprises the following counties in southern Minnesota: Winona, Wabasha, Olmstead, Dodge, Steele, Waseca, Blue Earth, Watonwan, Cottonwood, Murray, Pipestone, Rock, Nobles, Jackson, Faribault, Martin, Freeborn, Mower, Fillmore, and Houston. The area of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 12,282 square miles.

<p>The early <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> voyagers and missionaries visited many parts of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a> now under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Winona. In 1660 Groseiliers and Radisson made a visit to the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Prairie Sioux</a> in southern or south-western Minnesota. There are, however, no definite records showing what route they took or how far they travelled; in all probability they followed the course of the Minnesota River. In 1680 <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a>, accompanied by Antoine* Augelle and Michael Accault, set out from Fort Creve-coeur to explore the Upper Mississippi. On the Minnesota shore, the territory which they passed on the journey from La Crescent to Lake City now belongs to the Diocese of Winona. In 1683 Nicholas Perrot established a trading-post at or near the site of the present city of Wabasha. With him was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Joseph Jean Marest who laboured as a missionary among the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux Indians</a>. More than a century and a half had elapsed when Bishop Loras, in 1839, journeyed from <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a> to Mendota to minister to the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had but recently settled in that vicinity. In 1840 Father Galtier was sent to Mendota. He was the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to exercise the sacred ministry in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. During his pastorate at Mendota, Father Galtier made many visits to Wabasha. Here, in 1839, Augustine Rocque had erected a trading-post. At Mr. Rocque's home Father Galtier assembled the early settlers and offered for them the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. In April, 1843, Monsignor Ravoux, travelling from Mendota to <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, visited, among other places, Wabasha and Winona. In his "Memoirs" he writes that Winona was then "a prairie without inhabitants". In fact, when Bishop Cretin came to <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1851, no systematic attempt at settlement had been made in what is now the Diocese of Winona. On 2 February, 1855, at Mankato, Monsignor Ravoux celebrated what was very probably the first Mass ever offered in south-western Minnesota. In June of the same year Bishop Cretin visited Mankato and organized the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Peter and St. Paul. Father Sommereisen became its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> on 16 March, 1856. Many of the missions in south-western Minnesota were established by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who took charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Mankato on 27 January, 1874. In 1856 Bishop Cretin visited Winona and organized a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whom he found there. In 1857 he placed the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> under the care of the Rev. Thomas Murray. Monsignor Oster, then a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on mission <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, made occasional visits to Winona. In July, 1858, the Rev. Michael Prendergast became the first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Besides his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in Winona, Father Prendergast had charge of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Wabasha, Olmstead, Houston, Fillmore, Steele, and Mower Counties. In 1856 Bishop Cretin visited Brownsville, Caledonia, Rushford, Chatfield, Buckley Settlement (now St. Bridget's), and many other places in southern Minnesota. He was the pioneer <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and the founder of the pioneer <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the present Diocese of Winona.

<p>With the advent of the railroads, southern Minnesota developed rapidly. It is a rich agricultural district, well adapted to the needs of diversified farming. So well did the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> flourish in this section of the state that in 1889 southern Minnesota was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with Winona as the episcopal city, and the Rev. Joseph B. Cotter its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Bishop Cotter was born at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 19 November, 1844. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Grace at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 23 May, 1971. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was sent to Winona as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Church of St. Thomas. With Bishop McGolrick of <a href="../cathen/05188c.htm">Duluth </a> and the late Bishop Shanley of <a href="../cathen/05786a.htm">Fargo</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 27 December, 1889. He died in Winona, 27 June, 1909. When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was formed, Bishop Cotter had 45 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 4 religious. There were 45 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, 49 mission churches, 15 stations, and 19 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by 2650 pupils. At his death in 1909 there were in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 85 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 7 religious; 72 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; 44 missions with churches; 8 station; 28 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by 4630 pupils. As second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Winona, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, on 4 March, 1910, selected the Rev. P.R. Heffron, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the St. Paul Seminary. Born in New York City in 1860, he spent his boyhood near Rochester, Minnesota. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 22 Dec., 1884, and became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, in 1889. In 1896 he was made vice-rector and in the following year <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the St. Pal Seminary. On the day of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Winona, 19 May, 1910, six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">Province of St. Paul</a>. Bishop Heffron was installed at Winona, 24 May, 1910. As a monument to the memory of his predecessor he erected in Winona (1911) the "Cotter School for Boys", of which the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have charge. In the fall of 1911 work was started at Terrace Heights, Winona, on the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for young men. Bishop Heffron has likewise established a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> journal entitled "The Winona Courier", which is published monthly at Winona.
