<h1>Diocese of Wladislaw</h1>  

<p>(Polish WLOCLAWEK; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> VLADISLAVIENSIS ET POMERANLAE).

<p>The historical origin of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is not known precisely. The city of Wladislaw, or Wloclawek, in the government of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, contains more than 40,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The old Polish historians follow John Dlugosz, the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a>, who narrates that Mieczyslaw, the first Polish king (962-92), after receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in 966, founded the two Archbishoprics of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Cracow, and seven <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, among which was Kruszwica, or Wloclawek. But as Dlugosz cites no historical document to prove his statement, no confidence can be placed in it. Bougufal, or Boguchwal, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Posen (d. 1253), another Polish chronicler, attributed the foundation of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to Miecszyslaw II (1025-34), but again without documentary support for his statement. Julian Bartoszewicz, another Polish writer ("Encyklopedya Powszechna", <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, 1860, III, 636), taking a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> as his authority, places the foundation as far back as 1148; but this very <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> contradicts the assertion by mentioning this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as already existing in 1123, placing it under the special protection of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Other historians attribute its foundation to Boleslaus the Brave (<em>Chrobry</em>) (922-1025); others again to Boleslaus the Bold (<em>Smialy</em>) (1058-80). This last opinion seems improbable, as the letter of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> to Boleslaus the Bold, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 April, 1075, not only does not mention the Diocese of Kruszica or of Wloclawek, but deplores the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (see Bielowski, "Mon. Poloniae hist.", III, <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, 1864, pp. 367-71). The only conclusion, therefore, by the light of historical documents, is that the Diocese of Wloclawek dates from the earlier half of the twelfth century. (See Fijalek, "Ustalenie chronologii biskupow wloclawskich", Cracow, 1894, pp. 7, 8.)

<p>According to Dlugosz the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of the Diocese of Wloclawek was at Kruszwica, a city in the territory of Kujawa. Under Bishop Onoldus (1161-80) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to Wloclawek. But this notice, passed over by other historians (see Rzepnicki, op, cit. in bibliography, II, 1, 2), is contradicted by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, dated from <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, 4 April, 1148, "Venerabili fratri Warnero, Vlotislaviensi episcopo" (Rzyszczewski, "Cod. dipl. Poloniae", II, pt. I, <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, 1848, p. 1-4). This <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> mentions that &AElig;gidius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tusculum, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> under Callisus II (Probably in 1123), determined the boundaries of the Diocese of Wloclawek, which, must, therefore, have existed in the first quarter of the twelfth century. On the other hand, historical documents are lacking to show clearly whether Kruszwica ever had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Chodynski supposes that it may have been the seat of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> invested with the episcopal dignity. But, as has already been pointed out, there are no positive data to establish this hypothesis.

<p>In its historical beginnings the Diocese of Wloclawek comprised the whole territory of Kujawa (Ziemia Kujawska) divided into the two palatinates of Inowroclaw and Brest. Subsequently the territory extending from the left bank of the Vistula, and from the River Notec, to the Baltic was added. This added territory is called, in Polish, <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>; in German, Pomerella. Under Bishop Mathias Lubienski its territory was increased by the villages of Ciechocin, Dobrzejewice, Chelmica, Zaduszniki, Nowogrod, and Zlotoria, taken from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Plock</a>. This cession was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1640. In 1764 Bishop Antonius Ostrowski obtained from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> the city of Wolborz with adjacent villages and the church of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Smarzewice, an arrangement confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on 13 August of the same year. Kujawia was divided into two archdeaconries; Kruszwica and Wloclawek, while <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, after the thirteenth century, formed a separate archdeaconry. These three archdeaconries existed until the first partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. According to an historical document of 1326 cited by <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a> (Mon. hist. Pol., I, 268), the archdeaconry of Kruszwica comprised 22 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; that of Wloclawek, 30; that of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, 9. In 1577 there were 118 churches in Kujawia; in 1633 there were 123, and 149 in <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>. In 1769 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, harassed by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, counted only 242; and in the same year there were 160,988 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.

<p>In 1818 the Diocese of Wloclawek underwent a complete change of boundaries, pursuant to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex imposita nobis" of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. All <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, with the cities of Kruszwica, Strzelno, Bydgoszcz, and Inowroclaw, passed under the dominion of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The new diocese took the name of Wloclawek and Kalisz (Vladislaviensis seu Calissiensis). Of its 344 churches only 59 belonged to the old diocese, the rest being taken from the Dioceses of Posen, <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Plock</a>, <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. In 1912 the Diocese of Wloclawek and Kalisz comprised 13 deaneries (Wloclawek, Nieszawa, Kalisz, Kola, Konin, Sieradz, Slupca, Turek, Wielun, Piotrkow, Czenstochowa, Lask, Radomsk), with 352 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or subsidiary churches. The total number of churches was 511, of which 286 were of stone and 125 of wood; the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> numbered 176, of which 114 were of stone. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was 1,461,147. The most important centres were Wloclawek, with 40,500 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; Brest (Brzesc), famous for the councils held there, out of which grew the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Uniat Church, 6000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; Sluzewo, 8500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; Kalisz, 22,000; Konin, 7200; Sieradz, 9600; Szadek, 7000; Zagorow, 8306; Turek, 11,100; Wielun, 7123; Piotrkow, 30,000; Czenstochowa, 70,000; Klobucko, 14,000; Truskolasy, 10,764; Pabjanice, 15,000; Radomsk, 20,514.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kruszwica &#151; which was the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of the Diocese of Wloclawek according to Dlugosz &#151; was Lucidus, who died in 993. Between 993 and 1133 the old Polish historians give the names of eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Maurice, or Lawrence, Marcellus, Venatius, Andreas, John Baptist, Paulinus, Baldwin, and Suidger But this list is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and at most, according to Chodyneski, gives the names of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Kruszwica or of the superiors of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which existed there. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wloclawek, whose name occurs in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> of 1148, is Warner. He was succeeded by Onoldus, an Italian by birth (1161-80). According to Chodynski's list, Onoldus was followed by two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Rudgerus (d. 1170) and Wunelphus, or Wunulphus, or Onolphus (d. 1187). These two are omitted in Fijalek's list, and his authority is of greater historical value than Chodynski's. From 1187 to 1198 one Stephen, a German by birth, according to Rzepnicki, is called <em>episcopus Cuiaviensis</em>. Then followed Ogerius, an Italian (1207-12); Bartha, a Roman (1215-20), who took part in the Synod of Woborz (1215); Michael, a <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Pole</a> (1222-52), who restored the archdeaconry of Kruswica, suppressed by Ogeris; Wolmir (1252-75); Adalbertus, Alberus, or Alber (1275-83); Wislaw (1284-1300); Gerward (1300-23), who had to contend with the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/08671a.htm">Knights of the Cross</a> to wrest some of his territory from him; Mathias Golanczweski (1323-68), who abdicated in 1364; Zbilut Golanczweski (13364-83); Teodryk (1383-84); John, Prince of Opolis (1384-89; 1402-21); Henry, Prince of Lignica (1389-98); Nicholas of Curow (1399-1402); John Pella of Niewiesz (1421-28); John Szafraniec (1428-33), chancellor of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; Ladislaus of Oporowa (1422-49); Nicholas Lasocki (1449-50), who died at <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a> returning from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he had gone as ambassador for Casimir Jagiellonczyk (1147-92); John Gruszczynski (1449-63), chancellor of the kingdom; John Lutka (1463-64); James of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> (1464-73); <a href="../cathen/11240c.htm">Zbigniew of Olesnica</a> (1473-80); Andrew of Oporowa (1481-83); Peter Moszynski (1484-94); Creslao (Krzeslau) of Kurozwenk (1494-1503), chancellor of the kingdom; Vincentius Przerenbski (1503-13); Mathias of Drzewice (1513-31); John Karnowski (1531-38); Lucas of Gorka (1538-42); Nicholas Dzierzgowski (1543-46); Andreas Zebrzydowski (1546-51); John Drohojowski (1551-57); James Uchanski (1557-61); Nicholas Wolski (1562-67); <a href="../cathen/08608a.htm">Stanislaus Karnkowski</a> (1567-81), who published the documents of the provincial Synod of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (1578); Jerome Rozdrazewski (1581-1600), who died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; John Tarnowski(1600-03); Peter Tylicki (1604-07); Adalbert Baranowski (1607-08); Mathias Petrokowski (1608-09); Lawrence Gembicki (1609-15); Paul Wolucki (1616-22); Andreas Lipski (1623-31); Mathias Lubienski (1631-41); Nicholas Gniewosz (1642-54); Florian Czartoryski (1654-74); John Gembicki (1674-75); Stanislaus Sarnowski (1677-80); Bonaventure Modalinski (1681-91); Stanislaus Dambski (1691-99); Stanislaus Szembek (1699-1706); Felician Szanawski (1707-20); Christopher Szembek (1720-38); Adam Grabowski (1738-41); Valens Czapski (1741-51); Antonius Dembowski (152-62); Antonius Ostrowski (1762-66); Joseph Rybinski (1777-1806). On the death of Rybinski the See of Wloclawek remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for nine years. Francis Malczewski was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1815 to 1818. In 1819 the Diocese of Wloclawek, with new boundaries determined by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex imposita nobis", received as its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Andrew Wollowicz (1819-22), who was succeeded by Joseph Stephen Kozmian (1823-31). The see then remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> until 1837, when Valentine Tomazewski was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1837-50). He was followed by Nicholas Blocki (d. 1851); John Michael Marzewski (1856-57); Vincent Popiel (1867-83); Alexander Beresniewicz (1883-1902); Stanislaus Casimir Zdzitowiecki.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> also had suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the first of whom there is any mention was Ubricus, suffragan of John, Prince of Opole (1402-21). Kreslaus of Kurozwenk obtained an edict in virtue of which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Monastery of Koronow had the dignity of suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was not obeyed. Mathias Drjewicki had the canon Alexander of Miszin <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1515, with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Margarita. Bishop Karnowski endeavoured, by means of a capitular constitution, to obtain that the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> should be elected from among the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and canons of Wloclawek. Bishop Ostrowski obtained from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> a new suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, but this suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> had only three incumbents: Cyprian Wolicki, Mathias Garnysz, and Ludovicus Gorski.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were widely diffused in the Diocese of Wloclawek. In 1173 there arose in <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> the famous <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Oliwa, and in 1251 the no less famous Abbey of Peplin. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> had <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Dirschau and Brest; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Zakrzew, Marcowice, and Bydgoszcz; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Inowroclaw and Nieszawa. Other orders flourished in the various cities and villages of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> &#151; Paulines (Reformed) Fatebenefratelli (or <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Order of St. John of God</a>), <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. Among the communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> the most ancient are those of the Premonstatensian Nuns of Zukow, founded in 1210, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns of Zarnowiec, founded in 1213. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> are now nearly all extinct; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, however, possesses the historic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Czenstochowa founded in 1382 and occupied by a community of Paulines, or Hermits of St. Paul. In this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is a highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> icon of the Blessed Virgin, visited every year by hundreds of thousands of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Czenstochowa is the national sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> still possess <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Kolo, founded in 1456, and at Wloclawek, founded n 1524; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Wielun founded in 1682; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters, one at Przyrow, founded in 1626. The Sisters of Charity were established at Czenstochowa, Kalisz, Konin, Piotrkow, Sieradz, Wielun, Turek, and Wloclawek. According to official statistics, the number of regulars in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 37; the number of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 24, besides 55 Sisters of Charity. The present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Wloclawek was begun in 1340 and completed in 1411. It was extremely wealthy and at the end of the sixteenth century there were 100 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> attached to it. The Divine offices were celebrated in it uninterruptedly, day and night. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter included eight <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. At the beginning of the sixteenth century it was established that no one who did not possess a title of nobility could become a canon. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in 1862, granted the canons of this <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to wear the violet mozzetta. The chapter now consists of four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and eight canons. At Kalisz there is also an ancient collegiate church to which three <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and four canons are now attached. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into three general consistories: at Wloclawek, Kalisz, and Piotrkow.

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> is 538. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, founded in 1568 by <a href="../cathen/08608a.htm">Bishop Karnkowski</a>, is in a very flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the seminarists was in 1719 entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, who continued in the charge until 1864. There are 102 seminarists. In 1910 the professors of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> began the publication of a splendid monthly review, "Ateneum kaplanski", which, for solidity of learning and wealth of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and religious contents holds the first place in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The ancient Diocese of Wloclawek had much to suffer from Hussitism, and afterwards from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. The negligence of Bishops Zebrzydowski, Drohiowski, and Uchanski contributed to the diffusion of the latter <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> was almost entirely lost to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Numerous <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were convoked in the Diocese of Wloclawek. Chodynski mentions the acts and decrees of forty-six <em>synodi vladislavienses</em>, of which he publishes a large number. The first of these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> was held in 1227 and the last in 1641.
