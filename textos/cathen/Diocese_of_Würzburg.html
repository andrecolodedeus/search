<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at W&uuml;rzburg, a Romanesque basilica with pier-arches, the most important Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, was built between the twelfth and the fourteenth centuries. n the seventeenth century its interior was overloaded with Baroque stucco work and spiral ornamentation; it contains 35 <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, several by <a href="../cathen/13052b.htm">Riemenschneider</a>, of the prince-bishops. At the north end of the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> is the Sch&ouml;nborn <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, a domed structure in the most elaborate <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Rococo style</a>. The Neumunster Church, or Cathedral, of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> (Baroque style), built during 711-16 in place of the earlier church over the grave of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a>, contains the bodies of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> and his companions; the Hauger Collegiate Church, built (1670-83) by Petrini, has a fine <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>; the Church of St. Peter, originally Romanesque with a Gothic choir, was enlarged in the Baroque style during 1717-20; the University Church, built by <a href="../cathen/05271a.htm">Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn</a> and dedicated in 1591, is a curious mixture of Gothic and <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> styles; the Chapel of the Virgin (Marienkapelle), a <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, built 1377-1479, contains numerous figures by <a href="../cathen/13052b.htm">Riemenschneider</a>; the Church of St. Adalbero, built 1896-99, is in Romanesque style from the design by <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Burchard, erected in the eleventh century in the Romanesque style on the site of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> church built by St. Burchard, was enlarged in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style during 494 to 1497. Outside of W&uuml;rzburg special mention should be made of the church at Dettelbach and the collegiate church at Aschaffenburg. Places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: the Church of St. Nicholas (called <em>K&auml;ppele</em>) near W&uuml;rzburg; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> church near Dettelbach, and the Engelberg near Miltenberg.

<p>The first Apostle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> for the territory now included in the Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg was the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionary, <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a>, who converted Gozbert the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> duke of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> but who fell a sacrifice to the enmity of the duchess. In his castle above W&uuml;rzburg, Gozbert's son Hetan built the first church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin; on this account the castle received the name of Marienburg. The first mention of W&uuml;rzburg is in 704, when it is called <em>Castellum Virtebuch</em>. A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established in W&uuml;rzburg by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, who in 741 <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his friend St. Burchard as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; in 742 Pope Zachary confirmed the selection of Burchard. St. Burchard (741-53) built the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, and buried there the bodies of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> and his companions; he connected with the church a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which followed the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. Karlmann, the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> mayor of the palace, gave great gifts of land to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. In 752 or 753 the church of W&uuml;rzburg was granted immunity for all its possessions, also secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, whereby the foundation was laid for the future <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Like the majority of his successors, St. Burchard lived at the Marienburg, which he had received from the last duke in exchange for another fortified castle. His successor, St. Megingoz or Megingaud (753-85), did much towards Christianizing Saxony. Bishop Bernwelf (785-800) replaced the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by the Brothers of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a>, who led a common life after the rule of Chrodegang of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. Arno (855-92) rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been destroyed by lightning, on the site of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; in 892 he took part in the campaign of Emperor Arnolf against the Duke of Moravia, and was killed by the enemy while celebrating Mass. During the episcopate of Dietho (908-31) the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were confirmed anew by Henry I. Burchard II (930-41) rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been burned a second time. Poppo I of Henneberg (941-61) obtained for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> from <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a>, whose chancellor he had been, the right of the free election of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Bishop Henry I of Rothenburg (995-1018) built, on the site of the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the Neumunster Cathedral of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a>, and founded the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Stephen and the abbey of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> called Haug, in which he himself was buried. He gave an unwilling consent to the separation from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, by Emperor Henry II, of a large part of its territory; this portion was made into an independent diocese, the "imperial" <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Archdiocese of Bamberg</a>. Bernhard of Rothenburg (1018-33) received from Emperor Henry II the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the use of the forest in the Steigerwald, and from Emperor Conrad II the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> and of exacting customs. The Saxon Bruno (1034-45), a cousin of Conrad II, laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and restored the Abbey of St. Burchard. His nephew and successor, who is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as Saint Adalbero of Lambach and Weis (1045-90), sided with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a>, took part in the election of both rival kings, and was therefore declared deposed from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> by <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, and forced into exile. The city and diocese suffered greatly during the struggles in which <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and imperial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> frequently engaged. During the episcopate of Erlung (106-26), who received from Henry V the formal confirmation of the dignity of a Duke of Eastern Franconia, peace was restored in the diocese. Embrico (1125-47) favoured the founding of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the reformed orders, as: the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Ebrach; the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of Zell near W&uuml;rzburg, established by St. Norbert himself; the Scotch Abbey of St. James in W&uuml;rzburg. Under Gebhard of Henneberg (1150-59) <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> celebrated at W&uuml;rzburg his marriage with Beatrice of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; Herold of H&ouml;chheim (1165-71) received from <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> "complete judicial authority in the entire diocese and duchy of W&uuml;rzburg and over all countships situated in the diocese or duchy".



<p>The brilliant position which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> occupied among the German princes often cost the diocese heavy <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and expeditions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to undertake in the retinue of the emperors; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were involved, not only in the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a>, but also in the struggle of the Hohenstaufen dynasty with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The city of W&uuml;rzburg made use of this struggle to gain greater freedom from the episcopal power, and strove to obtain freedom of the empire. The vigorous Bishop Hartmann von Lodenburg (1225-54), a loyal adherent of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, was able to keep the citizens within bounds, but during the episcopate of his successor, Iring von Reinstein (1254-66), W&uuml;rzburg joined the confederation of the cities of the Rhine as an independent city. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> encouraged the settlement of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in the diocese. His successors had to wage many <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the city. Albrecht von Hohenlohe (1345-72), during whose reign the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was ravaged with the Black Death, checked the presumption of the citizens with the aid of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>; Gerhard von Schwarzburg (1372-1400) by his victory over the citizens at Bergstein, in 1400, put an end to the schemes to make W&uuml;rzburg a free city of the empire. John I von Egloffstein (140-01), and excellent administrator, founded the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. John II von Br&uuml;nn (1411-40) brought the diocese to the brink of financial ruin. Gottrried IV von Limburg (1442-55), a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> reformer, and John III von Grumbach (1455-6) had to fight against the claims of the Margraves of Ansbach and Bayreuth of the Brandenburg line. The able Rudolph von Scherenberg (1466-95) raised the diocese to a very flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, so that he was regarded as the second founder of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The same spirit animated Lorenz von Bibra (1495-1519), a friend of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and a patron of <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a>, whom he appointed <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the Scotch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at W&uuml;rzburg. Conrad von Thungen (1519-40) sought to the utmost of his ability to prevent the entrance of the new doctrines. During his episcopate the peasants who had revolted devastated the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the episcopal castle suffered a long siege from 20,000 peasants. Melchior von Zobel (1544-58) sought to preserve his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by instituting reforms, and for this purpose he attended the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which was composed of worldly minded nobles, blocked his efforts; he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> nobleman, William von Grumbach. Frederick von Wirsberg (1558-73) brought the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to W&uuml;rzburg, and in 1570 gave them charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys and a boarding-school which he had established. He was followed by the greatest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> W&uuml;rzburg ever had, <a href="../cathen/05271a.htm">Julius Echter von Meselbrunn</a> (1573-1617), during whose episcopate the diocese took on fresh life. Of his labours the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which he refounded, and the Julius Hospital, built by him, for hundreds of years the largest charitable institution in all <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, still exist. John Gottfried von Aschhausen (1617-22) united for the first time the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of W&uuml;rzburg and <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. During the episcopate of Philip Adolph von Ehrenberg (1622-31) many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> nephew, for <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a>. This led the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Frederick von Spee to write his celebrated treatise against <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a>.

<p>In 1631 the Swedes conquered the diocese and city, which, united with Bamberg, was given to Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar as the Duchy of Franconia. It was not until the imperial troops were victorious at Nordlingen in 1634 that Bishop Frederick von Hatzfeld (1631-42) could enter his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Notwithstanding their oppression by the Swedes, the population remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. During the reign of John Philip von Sch&ouml;nborn (1642-73) the diocese recovered from the injuries of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. Francis Philip von Greiffenklau (1699-1717) had the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the Church of St. Peter ornamented in the Baroque style. The diocese ad city prospered greatly under Philip Francis von Sch&ouml;nborn (1719-24), who laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the episcopal palace at W&uuml;rzburg, one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in the world. Christopher von Hutten (1724-29), and Frederick Karl von Sch&ouml;nborn (1729-46). Adam von Seinsheim (1755-79), during whose episcopate the Seven Years War caused the diocese great suffering, did much for the benefit of the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He was followed by the excellent Bishop Francis Ludwig von Erthal (1759-95). The last Prince-Bishop of W&uuml;rzburg was George Karl von Fechenbach. In 1802 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which contained over 250,000 inhabitants, was secularized and given to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. After the Peace of Pressburg, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cede it to the brother of Emperor Francis, the Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, who ruled it as the Grand Duchy of W&uuml;rzburg until 1814. After the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> the territory reverted to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. After the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs were administered by the <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, Zirkel, who <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> and successfully maintained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the Governments and statesmen.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Concordat of 1817 and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dei ac Domini nostri", of 1 April, 1818, established the Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg with its present boundaries, and made it a suffragan of the smaller and less ancient <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Diocese of Bamberg</a>; the Bishops of W&uuml;rzburg, however, were granted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Frederick Gross von Trockau (1818-40), did much for the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and for the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. During the episcopate of George Anthony von Stahl (1840-70) there was held in 1848 at W&uuml;rzburg the conference of German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which inaugurated a new development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Bishop von Stahl died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, in which he had taken an active part. He was followed by Valentine von Reissmann (1871-75), his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for many years; von Reissmann took successful measures against the spread of the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Francis Joseph von Stein (1878-98), who laboured for the improvement of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was transferred to the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF MUNICH-FREISING</a>). The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Ferdinand von Schl&ouml;r, was appointed on 5 March, 1898, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 22 May, 1898.
