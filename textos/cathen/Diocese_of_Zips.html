<h1>Diocese of Zips</h1>  

<p>(SZEPES; SCEPUSIENSIS).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01230a.htm">Agria</a> (Eger), founded by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> in 1776, and composed of the exempt provostship of St. Martin, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of foundation of which is unknown, but probably in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Besides the provostship, a collegiate chapter also existed at Zips. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Zips were among the most prominent ecclesiastical dignitaries of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and were appointed by the chapter; in later times the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were appointed by the kings of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The provostship was directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> exercised quasi-episcopal functions. In 1291 Provost Jacobus is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zips, but this dignity was not transmitted to his successors. The chapter consisted originally of four members. In the thirteenth century, the Tatars destroyed the church and burnt the archives. After the departure of the Tatars, B&eacute;la IV had the church rebuilt. A great number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were established by the Saxons who settled in Zips. In 1271 they received from King Stephen V the privilege of free election to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. This privilege was exercised by thirteen towns of the Diocese of Zips pledged to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> by King Sigismund in 1412, as well as by other towns not pledged. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> found a fertile soil in Zips, and spread especially under Stanislav Thurzo. Vigorous steps towards the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> were not taken until 1641. After that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> made better progress. In 1776 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was established, and Karl Salbeck appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Among his successors may be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/12586b.htm">Ladislav Pyrker</a>, 1816-21, an eminent poet, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01230a.htm">Agria</a> and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; Joseph Samassa, 1871-73, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01230a.htm">Agria</a>; George Cs&aacute;szka, 1874-91, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Kalocsa. Alexander Parvy is the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1910). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> includes the <em>Komitate</em> of Zips, Arva, and Lipto. It is divided into three archdeaconries and has in its territory one <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and five titular <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, one provostship and thirteen titular provostships. The number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> is 165; that of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> 245. In the diocese there are 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, with 83 inmates. The patronage is exercised by 34 patrons. The chapter includes 10 canons and 6 titular canons. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is 237,140.
