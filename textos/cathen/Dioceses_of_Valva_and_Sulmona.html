<h1>Dioceses of Valva and Sulmona</h1>  

<p>(VALVEN. ET SULMONEN.)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; united <em>aeque principaliter</em>. Valva, a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> castle belonging to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sulmona, Baron of Valva, is situated near the ancient Corfinium, chief town of the Peligni, A Samnite tribe. In the Social War it was the capital of the Italici, who called it Italia, a name found on some <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. Of the ancient city there remains the Church of S. Pelino, which recalls the race of the Peligni rather than a saint. The ruins contained a great number of inscriptions. Corfinium, like Valva, had apparently its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; S. Pelino was the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the vicinity of Valva is the sanctuary of S. Michele, near which is a large natural grotto. Sulmona, formerly Sulmo, is situated in a fertile plain, watered by the Gizzio, a tributary of the Pescara, at the base of the Maiella and Monte Morrone. The inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, the manufacture of liquors, confetti, and musical strings, and tanning. Among the churches are S. Maria della Tomba, the Annuziata, S. Francesco. Near the city is the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Spirito Santo, erected by <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> for his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; it is noted for its architecture. The town hall dates from the fifteenth century. Sulmona was a Pelignian city, and is first mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of Hannibal, during which is remained faithful to the Romans. In the Social War it was destroyed by Sulla. Ovid, who celebrates the salubrity of its climate, was born there. There are ruins of <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and ancient buildings in the vicinity. In the Lombard period the city was subject to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>; later it belonged to the counts of the Marsi. When the Normans conquered the Abruzzi, Sulmona increased in importance. <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> made it the capital of the "Gran Giustizierato" of the Abruzzi. In 1451 Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> defeated there Count Ruggierone, an ally of Rene of Anjou; the city was regained by Piccinino, who was later defeated and slain by Ferdinand I.

<p>Legend associates the evangelizing of the district with the name of St. Britius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, in the second century. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sulmona is <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> (499); in 503 a Fortunatus Valvensis is mentioned. St <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Valva, renowned for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, died about 706; as he was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Sulmona, the sees had possibly been united then. Four or five other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Valva are known, but none of Sulmona until 1054, when <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> named as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Valva, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Domenico, and determined the limits of the Dioceses of S. Pelino (Valva) and S. <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> (Sulmona), which were to have only one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, elected by the two chapters. Under Bishop Giacomo di Penne, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Casa Nova (1252), it was arranged that the two chapters should unite in making the election, as frequent disputes had arisen when they acted separately. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Bartolomeo of Tocco (1402), highly esteemed for his learning by <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, who gave him his own <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>; Donato Bottini (1448), an Augustinian, who enriched the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Pompeo Zambeccari (1547), <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who restored the episcopal residence; Francesco Bonapaduli (1638), who founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Pietro Antonio Corsignani (17380, the historian of the Abruzzi. During the dispute between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> from 1800 till 1818. The See of Sulmona is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It contains; 58 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 150,000 inhabitants, 200 secular, and 48 regular, priests; 3 houses of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes for boys, and 1 for girls.
