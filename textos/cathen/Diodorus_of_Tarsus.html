<h1>Diodorus of Tarsus</h1>  

<p>Date of birth uncertain; d. about A.D. 392. He was of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, probably of Antioch. <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> calls him a "nursling" of Silvanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, but whether this <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">discipleship</a> was at Antioch or at <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> is not known. He studied at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, then embraced the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state. He became head of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in or near <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> was his disciple. When Antioch groaned under <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he did not join the small party of irreconcilables headed by Paulinus, yet when Bishop Leontius made A&euml;tius a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Diodorus and Flavian threatened to leave his communion and retire to the West, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> yielded. These two holy men, though not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> taught the people to sing the Psalms in alternate choirs (a practice which quickly spread throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), at first in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, then, at Leontius's invitation, in the churches. When at length, in 361, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party appointed an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of St. Meletius, Diodorus was made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He seems to have written some of his works against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> as early as the reign of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, for that emperor declared that Diodorus had used the learning and eloquence of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods, who had punished him with sickness of the throat, emaciation, wrinkles, and a hard and bitter life. In the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> (364-78), Flavian and Diodorus, now <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, during the exile of Meletius kept the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> together, assembling them on the northern bank of the Orontes, since the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> emperor did not permit <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship within the city. Many times banished, Diodorus, in 372, made the acquaintance of St. Basil in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, whither that saint had come to visit Meletius. On the return of the latter to his flock, he made Diodorus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Cilicia. <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> soon after, in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, named Diodorus and St. Pelagius of Laodicea as norms of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> for the whole East. Diodorus was at the Councils of Antioch in 379 and of Constantinople in 381. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> makes him responsible at the latter council for the proposal of Nectarius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, and represents him as one of the chief movers in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a> as successor to Meletius, by which the unhappy <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at Antioch was prolonged.

<p>Diodorus came to Antioch in 386 or later, when <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> was already a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In a sermon he spoke of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> as a <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, the Voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Rod of Moses. Next day <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> ascended the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and declared that when the people had applauded, he had groaned; it was Diodorus, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, the Antiochenes could bear witness how he had lived without possessions, having his food from <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and persevering in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and preaching; like the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a> he had taught on the other side of the river, often he had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>--nay, he had been often beheaded, at least in will, for the Faith. In another sermon he likens Diodorus to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: "See his mortified limbs, his face, having the form of a man, but the expression of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a>!"

<p>St. Basil in 375 asked Diodorus to disown a fictitious letter circulated in his name, permitting marriage with a deceased wife's sister. In the following year he criticizes the rhetorical style of the longer of two treatises sent him by Diodorus, but gives warm praise to the shorter. Diodorus's style is praised by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, Theodoret, and Photius, but of his very numerous writings of a few unimportant fragments have been preserved, chiefly in Caten&aelig; (q.v). He wrote against some of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and still more against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> philosophy. Photius gives a detailed summary of his eight books "de Fato"; they were evidently very dull from a modern point of view. According to Leontius he composed commentaries on the whole Bible. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says that these were imitations of those of Eusebius of <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, but less distinguished by secular learning. Diodorus rejected the allegorical interpretation of the Alexandrians, and adhered to the literal sense. In this he was followed by his disciple <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in his unequalled expositions. The Antiochene School of which he was the leader was discredited by the subsequent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of Nestorius, of whom his disciple <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> was the precursor. Theodoret wrote to exculpate Diodorus, but St. Cyril declared him a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. The damning passages cited by Darius Mercator and Leontius seem, however, to belong to a work of Theodore, not of Diodorus; nor was the latter condemned when Theodore and passages of Theodoret and Ibas (the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>) were condemned by the Fifth General Council (553). It seems certain that Diodorus went too far in his opposition to (the younger) Apollinarius of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, according to whom the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in Christ was supplied by the Logos. Diodorus, in emphasizing the completeness of the Sacred Humanity, appears to have asserted two hypostases, not necessarily in a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense. If the developments by Theodore throw a shade on the reputation of Diodorus, the praise of all his contemporaries and especially of his disciple <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> tend yet more strongly to exculpate him. It will be best to look upon Diodorus as the innocent source of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> only in the sense that <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> is admittedly the unwilling origin of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> through some incorrect expressions. Against this view are Julicher [in Theol. lit. Z. (1902), 82-86] and Funk [in "Rev. d' hist. eccl.", III (1902), 947-71; reprinted with improvements in "Kirchengesch, Abhandl." (Paderborn, 1907), III, 323].

<p>The fragments of his Commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are collected in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XXXIII, from the Catena of Nicephorus and that published by <a href="../cathen/04359a.htm">Corderius</a> (Antwerp, 1643-6), also from <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, "Nova Patrum Bibl.", VI. A few more are found in Pitra "Spicilegium Solesmense" (Paris, 1852), I. A long list of the lost works is in <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>, "Bibl. Gr.", V, 24 (reprinted in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> loc. cit.). Some Syriac dogmatic fragments are in Lagarde, Analecta Syriaca", (Leipzig and London, 1858). Four treatises of Pseudo-Justin Martyr have been attributed to Diodorus by Harnack ("Texte und Unters.", N.F., VI, 4, 1901).
