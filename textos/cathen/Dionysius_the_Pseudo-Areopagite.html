<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite</h1>  

<p>By "Dionysius the Areopagite" is usually understood the judge of the Areopagus who, as related in <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs34">Acts 17:34</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and according to <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius of Corinth</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.4</a>) was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>.

<p>In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, however, two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of far-reaching import arose in connection with this name. In the first place, a series of famous writings of a rather peculiar nature was ascribed to the Areopagite and, secondly, he was popularly identified with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Gaul, Dionysius, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It is not our purpose to take up directly the latter point; we shall concern ourselves here (1) with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Pseudo-Areopagite; (2) with the classification, contents, and characteristics of his writing; (3) with their history and transmission; under this head the question as to the genuineness of, origin, first acceptance, and gradual spread of these writings will be answered.

<p>Deep obscurity still hovers about the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Pseudo-Areopagite. External evidence as to the time and place of his birth, his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and latter occupation is entirely wanting. Our only source of information regarding this problematic personage is the writings themselves. The clues furnished by the first appearance and by the character of the writings enable us to conclude that the author belongs at the very earliest to the latter half of the fifth century, and that, in all probability, he was a native of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. His thoughts, phrases, and expressions show a great familiarity with the works of the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>, especially with Plotinus and Proclus. He is also thoroughly versed in the sacred books of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and in the works of the Fathers as far as <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>. (Passages from the Areopagitic writings are indicated by title and chapter. in this article D.D.N. stands for "De divinis nominibus"; C.H. for "Caelestis hierarchia"; E.H. for "Ecclesiastica hierarchia"; Th.M. for "Theologia mystica", which are all found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., vol. III) In a letter to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> (Ep. vii; P.G., III, 1080 A) and in "Cael. hier." (ix, 3; P.G. III, 260 D) he intimates that he was formerly a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, and this seems quite probable, considering the peculiar character of his literary work. But one should be more cautious in regard to certain other personal references, for instance, that he was chosen teacher of the "newly-baptized" (D.D.N., iii, 2; P.G., III, 681 B); that his spiritual father and guide was a wise and saintly man, <a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a> by name; that he was advised by the latter and ordered by his own superiors to compose these works (ibid., 681 sq.). And it is plainly for the purpose of deceiving that he tells of having observed the solar eclipse at <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Crucifixion</a> (Ep., vii, 2; P.G., III, 1081 A) and of having, with <a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a>, the Apostles (Peter and James), and other hierarchs, looked upon "the Life-Begetting, God-Receiving body, i.e., of the Blessed Virgin" (D.D.N., iii, 2; P.G., III, 681 C). The former of these accounts is based on <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs45">Matthew 27:45</a>, and <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs33">Mark 15:33</a>; the latter refers to the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> descriptions of the "Dormitio Mariae". For the same purpose, i.e., to create the impression that the author belonged to the times of the Apostles and that he was identical with the Areopagite mentioned in the Acts, different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a>, Paul, Timothy, Titus, Justus, and Carpus, with whom he is supposed to be on intimate terms, figure in his writings.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> attitude of the Pseudo-Areopagite is not clearly defined. A certain vagueness, which was perhaps intended, is characteristic of his <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>, especially in the question concerning the two natures in Christ. We may well surmise that he was not a stranger to the latter, and rather modified, form of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> and that he belonged to that conciliatory group which sought, on the basis of the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> issued in 482 by Emperor Zeno (<a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, Hist. Eccl., III, iv), to reconcile the extremes of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. This reserved, indefinite attitude of the author explains the remarkable fact that opposite factions claimed him as an adherent. As to his social rank, a careful comparison of certain details scattered through his works shows that he belonged to the class of scholars who were known at the time as <em>scholastikoi</em>.

<p>The writings themselves form a collection of four treatises and ten letters. The first treatise, which is also the most important in scope and content, presents in thirteen chapters an explanation of the Divine names. Setting out from the principle that the names of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are to be learned from Scripture only, and that they afford us but an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Dionysius discusses, among other topics, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, being, life, wisdom, power, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The one underlying thought of the work, recurring again and again under different forms and phrases, is: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the One Being (<em>to hen</em>), transcending all quality and predication, all affirmation and negation, and all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception, by the very force of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> gives to beings outside Himself their countless gradations, unites them in the closest bonds (<em>proodos</em>), keeps each by His care and direction in its appointed sphere, and draws them again in an ascending order to Himself (<em>epistrophe</em>). While he illustrates the inner life of the Trinity by metaphors of blossom and light applied to the Second and Third Persons (D.D.N., ii, 7 in P.G., III, 645 B), Dionysius represents the procession of all created things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the exuberance of being in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> (<em>to hyperpleres</em>), its outpouring and overflowing (D.D.N., ix, 9, in P.G., III, 909 C; cf. ii, 10 in P.G., III, 648 C; xiii, 1 in P.G., III, 977 B), and as a flashing forth from the sun of the Deity (D.D.N., iv, 6 in P.G., III,701 A; iv, 1 in P.G., III, 693 B). Exactly according to their physical nature created things absorb more or less of the radiated light, which, however, grows weaker the farther it descends (D.D.N., xi, 2 in P.G., III, 952 A; i, 2 in P.G., III, 588 C). As the mighty root sends forth a multitude of plants which it sustains and controls, so created things owe their origin and conservation to the All-Ruling Deity (D.D.N., x, 1 in P.G., III, 936 D). Patterned upon the original of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, righteousness, and peace, is the harmony that pervades the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> (D.D.N., chapters iv, viii, xi). All things tend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in Him are merged and completed, just as the circle returns into itself (D.D.N., iv, 14 in P.G., III, 712 D), as the radii are joined in the centre, or as the numbers are contained in unity (D.D.N., v, 6 in P.G., III, 820 sq.). These and many similar expressions have given rise to frequent charges of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> against the author. He does not, however, assert a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> emanation of things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but admits a free creative act on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (D.D.N., iv, 10, in P.G., III, 708 B; cf. C.H., iv, 1 in P.G., III, 177 C); still the echo of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> is unmistakable.



<p>The same thoughts, or their applications to certain orders of being, recur in his other writings. The second treatise develops in fifteen chapters the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the celestial <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, comprising nine angelic choirs which are divided into closer groupings of three choirs each (triads). The names of the nine choirs are taken from the canonical books and are arranged in the following order. First triad: <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">seraphim</a>, <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, thrones; second triad: virtues, dominations, powers; third triad: principalities, archangels, angels (C.H., vi, 2 in P.G., III, 200 D). The grouping of the second triad exhibits some variations. From the etymology of each choir-name the author labours to evolve a wealth of description, and, as a result, lapses frequently into tautology. Quite characteristic is the dominant <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the different choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are less intense in their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the farther they are removed from him, just as a ray of light or of heat grows weaker the farther it travels from its source. To this must be added another fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> peculiar to the Pseudo-Areopagite, namely, that the highest choirs transmit the light received from the Divine Source only to the intermediate choirs, and these in turn transmit it to the lowest. The third treatise is but a continuation of the other two, inasmuch as it is based upon the same leading <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. It deals with the nature and grades of the "ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>" in seven chapters, each of which is subdivided into three parts (<em>prologos, mysterion, theoria</em>). After an introduction which discusses <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> purpose in establishing the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and which pictures Christ as its Head, holy and supreme, Dionysius treats of three <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the Eucharist, extreme unction), of the three grades of the Teaching Church (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>), of three grades of the "Learning Church" (<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, people, and the class composed of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, energumens, and penitents), and, lastly, of the burial of the dead [C.H., iii, (3), 6 in P.G., III, 432 sq.; vi, in P.G., III, 529 sq.] The main purpose of the author is to disclose and turn to the uses of contemplation the deeper mystical meaning which underlies the sacred rites, ceremonies, institutions, and symbols. The fourth treatise in entitled "Mystical Theology", and presents in five chapters guiding principles concerning the mystical union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is entirely beyond the compass of sensuous or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perception (<em>epopteia</em>). The ten letters, four addressed to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Caius, and one each to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Dortheus, to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Sopater, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Demophilus, to the Bishop Titus, and to the Apostle John, contain, in part, additional or supplementary remarks on the above-mentioned principal works, and in part, practical hints for dealing with sinners and unbelievers. Since in all of these writings the same salient thoughts on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> recur with the same striking peculiarities of expression and with manifold references, in both form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, from one work to another, the assumption is justified that they are all to be ascribed to one and the same author. In fact, at its first appearance in the literary world the entire <em>corpus</em> of these writings was combined as it is now. An eleventh letter to Apollophanes, given in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., III, 1119, is a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> based on the seventh letter. Apocryphal, also, are a letter to Timothy and a second letter to Titus.

<p>Dionysius would lead us to infer that he is the author of still other learned treatises, namely: "Theological Outlines" (D.D.N., ii, 3, in P.G., III 640 B); "Sacred Hymns" (C.H., vii, 4 in P.G., III, 212 B); "Symbolic Theology" C.H., xv, 6 in P.G., III,336 A); and treatises on "The Righteous Judgment of God" (D.D.N., iv, 35 in P.G., III, 736 B); on "The Soul" (D.D.N., iv, 2 in P.G., III, 696 C); and on "The objects of Intellect and Sense" (E. H., i, 2 in P.G., III, 373 B). No reliable trace, however, of any of these writings has ever been discovered, and in his references to them Dionysius is as uncontrollable as in his citations from <a href="../cathen/07345b.htm">Hierotheus</a>. It may be asked if these are not fictions pure and simple, designed to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the genuineness of the actually published works. This suspicion seems to be more warranted because of other discrepancies, e.g., when Dionysius, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in his letter to Timothy, extols the latter as a <em>theoeides, entheos, theios ierarches</em>, and nevertheless seeks to instruct him in those sublime secret doctrines that are for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only (E.H., i, 5 in P.G., III, 377 A), doctrines, moreover, which, since the cessation of the <a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">Disciplina Arcani</a>, had already been made public. Again, Dionysius points out (D.D.N., iii, 2 in P.G., III, 681 B; cf. E.H., iv, 2 in P.G., III, 476 B) that his writings are intended to serve as <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction for the newly-baptized. This is evidently another contradiction of his above-mentioned statement.

<p>We may now turn to the history of the Pseudo-Dionysian writings. This embraces a period of almost fifteen hundred years, and three distinct turning points in its course have divided it into as many distinct periods: first, the period of the gradual rise and settlement of the writings in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, dating from the latter part of the fifth century to the Lateran Council, 649; second, the period of their highest and universally acknowledged authority, both in the Western and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, lasting till the beginning of the fifteenth century; third, the period of sharp conflict waged about their authenticity, begun by Laurentius Valla, and closing only within recent years.

<p>The Areopagitica were formerly were supposed to have made their first appearance, or rather to have been first noticed by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers, in a few pseudo-epigraphical works which have now been proved to be the products of a much later period; as, for instance, in the following: Pseudo-Origenes, "Homilia in diversos secunda"; Pseudo-Athanasius, "Quaestiones ad Antiochum ducem", Q. viii; Pseudo-Hippolytus, against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Beron; Pseudo-Chrysostom, "sermo de pseudo-prophetis." Until more recently more credit was given to other lines of evidence on which Franz Hipler endeavoured to support his entirely new thesis, to the effect that the author of the writings lived about the year 375 in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rhinokorura. Hipler's attempts, however, at removing the textual difficulties, <em>ekleipsis, adelphotheos, soma</em>, proved to be unsuccessful. In fact, those very passages in which Hipler thought that the Fathers had made use of the Areopagite (e.g., in <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and Jerome) do not tell in favor of this hypothesis; on the contrary, they are much better explained if the converse be assumed, namely, that Pseudo-Dionysius drew from them. Hipler himself, convinced by the results of recent research, has abandoned his opinion. Other events also, both historical and literary, evidently exerted a marked influence on the Areopagite: (1) the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> terminology of which was studiously followed by the Dionysius; (2) the writings of the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a> Proclus (411-485), from whom Dionysius borrowed to a surprising extent; (3) the introduction (c. 476) of the Credo into the liturgy of the Mass, which is alluded to in the "Ecclesiastical Hierarchy" [iii, 2, in P.G., III, 425 C, and iii, (3), 7 in P.G., III, 436 C; cf. the explanation of Maximus in P.G., IV, 144 B]; (4) the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> of the Emperor Zeno (482), a formula of union designed for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and faithful of the Orient, as a compromise between Monophystism and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Both in spirit and tendency the Areopagitica correspond fully to the sense of the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a>; and one might easily infer that they were made to further the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a>.

<p>The result of the foregoing data is that the first appearance of the pseuodo-epigraphical writings cannot be placed earlier than the latter half, in fact at the close, of the fifth century.

<p>Having ascertained a <em>terminus post quem</em>, it is possible by means of evidence taken from Dionysius himself to fix a <em>terminus ante quem</em>, thus narrowing to about thirty years the period within which these writings must have originated. The earliest reliable citations of the writings of Dionysius are from the end of the fifth and the beginning of the sixth century. The first is by Severus, the head of a party of moderate <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> named after him, and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (512-518). In a letter addressed to a certain <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, John (Mai, Script. vett. nov. coll., VII, i, 71), he quotes in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>mia synthetos physis</em> in Christ the Dionysian Ep. iv (P.G., III, 1072 C), where a <em>kaine theandrike energeia</em> is mentioned. Again, in the treatise "Adversus anathem. Juliani Halicarn." (Cod. Syr. Vat. 140, fol. 100 b), Severus cites a passage from D.D.N., ii, 9, P.G., III, 648A (<em>abba kai to pases &#151; thesmo dieplatteto</em>), and returns once more to Ep. iv. In the Syrian "History of the Church" of Zacharias (e. Ahrens-Kruger, 134-5) it is related that Severus, a man well-versed in the writings of Dionysius (Areop.), was present at the Synod in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (513). Andreas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> in Cappodocia, wrote (about 520) a commentary on the Apocalypse wherein he quotes the Areopagite four times and makes use of at least three of his works (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., CVI, 257, 305, 356, 780; cf. <a href="../cathen/04785b.htm">Diekamp</a> in "Hist. Jahrb", XVIII, 1897, pp. 1-36). Like Severus, Zacharias Rhetor and, in all probability, also Andreas of Cappodocia, inclined to <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> (Diekamp, a "Book of Hierotheus"---Hierotheus had come to be regarded as the teacher of Dionysius---existed in the Syrian literature of that time and exerted considerable influence in the spread of Dionysian doctrines. Frothingham (Stephen Bar Sudaili, p. 63 sq.) considers the pantheist Stephen Bar Sudaili as its author. Jobius Monachus, a contemporary of the writers just mentioned, published against Severus a polemical treatise which has since been lost, but claims the Areopagite as authority for the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teaching (P.G., CIII, 765). So also <a href="../cathen/05500a.htm">Ephraem</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (527-545), interprets in a right sense the well-known passage from D.D.N., i, 4, P.G., III,, 529 A: <em>ho haplous Iesous synetethe</em>, by distinguishing between <em>synthetos hypostasis</em> and <em>synthetos ousia</em>. Between the years 532-548, if not earlier, John of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a> in Palestine wrote an interpretation of Dionysius (Pitra, "Analect. sacr.", IV, Proleg., p. xxiii; cf. Loof's, "Leontius of Byzantium" (p. 270 sq.) from an anti-Severan standpoint. In <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a> (485-543) we have another important witness. This eminent champion of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> in at least four passages of his works builds on the <em>megas Dionysios</em> (P.G., LXXXVI, 1213 A; 1288 C; 1304 D; Canisius-Basnage, "Thesaur. monum. eccles.", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1725, I, 571). Sergius of Resaina in Mesopotamia, archiater and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> (d. 536), at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> translated the works of Dionysius into Syriac. He admitted their genuineness, and for their defence also translated into Syriac the already current "Apologies" (Brit. Mus. cod. add. 1251 and 22370; cf. Zacharias Rhetor in Ahrens-Kruger, p. 208). He himself was a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>.

<p>By far the most important document in the case is the report given by Bishop Innocent of <a href="../cathen/09683b.htm">Maronia</a> of the religious debate held at Constantinople in 533 between seven <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and seven Severian speakers (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> II, 1159 sq.). The former had as leader and spokesman, Hypatius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ephesus, who was thoroughly versed in the literature of the subject. On the second day the "Orientals" (Severians) alleged against the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, that it had by a novel and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> expression decreed two natures in Christ. Besides <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, and Felix and Julius of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they also quoted Dionysius the Areopagite as an exponent of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of one nature. Hypatius rejected as spurious all these citations, and showed that Cyril never made the slightest use of them, though on various occasions they would have served his purpose admirably. He suspects that these falsifiers are <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarists</a>. When the Severians rejoined that they could point out in the polemical writings of Cyril against Diodorus and Theodore the use made of such evidence, Hypatius persisted in the stand he had taken: "sed nunc videtur quoniam et in illis libris [Cyrilli] haeretici falsantes addiderunt ea". The references to the archives of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> had just as little weight with him, since Alexandria, with its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, had long been in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. How could an interested party of the opposition be introduced as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>? Hypatius refers again especially to Dionysius and successfully puts down the opposition: "Illa enim testimonia quae vos Dionysii Areopagitae dicitis, unde potestis ostendere vera esse, sicut suspicamini? Si enim eius erant, non potuissent latere beatum Cyrillum. Quis autem de beato Cyrillo dico, quando et beatus <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, si pro certo scisset eius fuisse, ante omnia in Nicaeno concilio de consubstantiali Trinitate eadem testimonia protulisset adversus Arii diversae substantiae blasphemias". Indeed, as to the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a> of the Father and the Son the Areopagite has statements that leave no room for misinterpretation; and had these come from a disciple of the Apostles, they would have been all the more valuable. Hereupon the Severians dropped this objection and turned to another.

<p>The fact must, indeed, appear remarkable that these very writings, though rejected outright by such an authority as Hypatius, were within little more than a century looked upon as genuine by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, so that they could be used against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> during the Lateran Council in 649 (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> III, 699 sqq.). How had this reversion been brought about? As the following grouping will show, it was chiefly heterodox writers, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, who during several decades appealed to the Areopagite. But among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also there were not a few who assumed the genuineness, and as some of these were <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of consequence, the way was gradually paved for the authorization of his writings in the above-mentioned council. To the group of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> belonged: Themistius, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in Alexandria about 537 (Hardoiun, III, 784, 893 sq., 1240 sq.); Colluthus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> III, 786, 895, 898); John Philoponus, an Alexandrian grammarian, about 546-549 (W. Reichardt, "Philoponus, de opificio mundi"); Petrus Callinicus, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, in the latter half of the sixth century, cited Dionysius in his polemic against the Patriarch Damianus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (II, xli, and xlvii; cf. Frothingham, op. cit., after Cod. Syr. Vat., 108, f. 282 sqq.). As examples of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> group may be mentioned Joseph Huzaja, a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, teacher about 580 at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a> (Assemani, Bibl. orient., vol. III, pt. I, p. 103); also Ischojeb, <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, from 580 or 581 to 594 or 595 (Braun, "Buch der Synhados", p. 229 sq.); and John of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in one of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> situated on the Orontes, belonging most probably to the sixth century (Cod. Syr. Vat., 93). The heads of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, Sergius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (610-638), Cyrus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (630-643), Pyrrhus, the successor of Sergius in Constantinople (639-641), took as the starting point in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> the fourth letter of Dionysius to Caius, wherein they altered the oft-quoted formula, <em>theandrike energeia</em> into <em>mia theandrike energeia</em>.

<p>To glance briefly at the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> group we find in the "Historia Euthymiaca", written about the middle of the sixth century, a passage taken, according to a citation of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a> (P.G., XCVI, 748), from D.D.N., iii, 2, P.G., III, 682 D: <em>paresan de &#151; epakousas</em>. Another witness, who at the same time leads over to the Latin literature, is <a href="../cathen/09215b.htm">Liberatus of Carthage</a> (Breviarium causae Nestor. et Euthych., ch. v). Johannes <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">Malalas</a>, of Antioch, who died about 565, narrates, in his "Universal Chronicle", the conversion of the judge of the Areopagus through <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs34">Acts 17:34</a>), and praises our author as a powerful philosopher and antagonist of the Greeks (P.G., XCVII, 384; cf. Krumbacher, Gesch. d. byz. Lit.", 3rd ed., p. 112 sq.). Another champion was Theodore, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. Though it is difficult to locate him chronologically, he was, according to <a href="../cathen/09151b.htm">Le Nourry</a> (P.G., III, 16), an "auctor antiquissimus" who flourished, at all events, before the Lateran Council in 649 and, as we learn from Photius (P.G., CIII, 44 sq.), undertook to defend the genuineness of the Areopagitic writings. The repute, moreover, of these writings was enhanced in a marked degree by the following eminent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>: Eulogius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (580-607), <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and quoted, among others, the D.D.N., xiii, 2, verbatim (P.G., CIII, 1061; cf. Der Katholic, 1897, II, p. 95). From Eulogius we naturally pass to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a>, with whom he enjoyed a close and honourable friendship. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (590-604), in his thirty-fourth <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on Like, xv, 1-10 (P.L.L. XXVI, 1254), distinctly refers to the Areopagite's teaching regarding the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>: "Fertur vero Dionysius Areopagitica, antiquus videlicet et venerabilis Pater, dicere" etc. (c.f. C.H., vii, ix, xiii). As <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> admits that he is not versed in Greek (Ewald, Reg., I,28; III, 63; X, 10, 21) he uses <em>fertur</em> not to express his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the genuineness, but to imply that he had to rely on the testimony of others, since at the time no Latin version existed. It is, indeed, most probable that Eulogius directed his attention to the work.

<p>About the year 620, Antiochus Monachus, a member of the Sabas <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, compiled a collection of moral "sentences" designed for the members of his order (P.G., LXXXIX, 1415 sqq.). In the "Homilia (capitulum) LII" we discover a number of similar expressions and Biblical examples which are borrowed from the eighth letter of Dionysius "ad Demophilum" (P.G., III, 1085 sq.). In other passages frequent reference is made to the D.D.N. In the following years, two Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, both from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, defend Dionysius as a time-honoured witness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrines. The first is the Patriarch Modestus (631-634), formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the Theodosius <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Judah. In a panegyric on the <em>Assumptio Mariae</em> (P.G., LXXXVI, 3277 sq.) he quotes sentences from the D.D.N., i, 4; ii,10; from the "Theologia Mystica", i, 1; and from Ep. ii. The second, a still brighter luminary in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is the Patriarch Sophronius (634-638), formerly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Theodosius <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Immediately after his installation he published an <em>epistula synodica</em>, "perhaps the most important document in the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitic</a> dispute". It gives, among other <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, a lengthy exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of two energies in Christ (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Conciliengesch., 2nd ed., III, 140 sqq.). Citing from "Eph. iv ad Caium" (<em>theandrike energeia</em>), he refers to our author as a man through whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaks and who was won over by the Divine Paul in a Divine manner (P.G., LXXXVII, 3177). Maximus Confessor evidently rests upon Sophronius, whose friendship he had gained while <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743a.htm">Chrysopolis</a> in Alexandria (633). In accordance with Sophronius he explains the Dionysian term <em>theandrike energeia</em> in an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> sense, and praises it as indicating both essences and natures in their distinct properties and yet in closest union (P.G., XCI, 345). Following the example of Sophronius, Maximus also distinguishes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> three kinds of actions (<em>theoprepeis, anthropoprepeis</em> and <em>miktai</em>) (P.G., IV, 536). Thus the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a> lost their strongest weapon, and the Lateran Council found the saving word (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, op. cit., 2nd ed., III, 129). In other regards also Maximus plays an important part in the authorization of the Areopagitica. A lover of theologico-mystical speculation, he showed an uncommon reverence for these writings, and by his glosses (P.G., IV), in which he explained dubious passages of Dionysius in an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> sense, he contributed greatly towards the recognition of Dionysius in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Another equally indefatigable of Dyophysitism was Anastasias, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sinai, who in 640 began his chequered career as a wandering preacher. Not only in his "Guide" (<em>hodegos</em>), but also in the "Quaestiones" and in the seventh book of the "Mediations on the Hexaemeron", he unhesitatingly makes use of different passages from Dionysius (P.G. LXXXIX). By this time a point had been reached at which the official seal, so to speak, could be put on the Dionysian writings. The Lateran Council of 649 solemnly rejected the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a> (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> III, 699 sq.). <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Pope Martin I</a> quotes from D.D.N., ii, 9; iv, 20 and 23; and the "Ep. ad Caium"; speaks of the author as "beatae memoriae Dionysius", "Dionysius egregius, sanctus, beatus," and vigorously objects to the perversion of the text: <em>una</em> instead of <em>nova Dei et viri operatio.</em> The influence which Maximus exerted by his personal appearance at the council and by his above-mentioned explanation of <em>theandrike energeia</em> is easily recognized ("Dionysius duplicem [operationem] duplicis naturae compositivo sermone abusus est" &mdash; <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, III, 787). Two of the testimonies of the Fathers which were read in the fifth session are taken from Dionysius. Little wonder, then, that thenceforth no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was expressed concerning the genuineness of the Areopagitica. Pope Agatho, in a dogmatic epistle directed to the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> (680) cites among other passages from the Fathers also the D.D.N., ii, 6. The Sixth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (680) followed in the footsteps of the Lateran Synod, again defended "Eph. iv ad. Caium" against the falsification of Pyrrhus, and rejected the meaning which the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> Patriarch Macarius assigned to the passage (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> III, 1099, 1346, 1066). In the second Council of Nicaea (787) we find the "Celestial Hierarchy" of the "deifer Dionysius" cited against the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a> (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> IV, 362). This finishes the first and darkest period in the history of the Areopagitica; and it may be summarized as follows. The Dionysian writings appeared in public for the first time in the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> controversies. The Severians made use of them first and were followed by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. After the religious debate at Constantinople in 533 witnesses for the genuineness of the Areopagitica began to increase among the different <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Despite the opposition of Hypatias, Dionysius did not altogether lose his authority even among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which was due chiefly to Leontius and Ephraem of Antioch. The number of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who defended him grew steadily, comprising high ecclesiastical dignitaries who had come from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Finally, under the influence of Maximus, the Lateran Council (649) cited him as a competent witness against <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>.

<p>As to the second period, universal recognition of the Areopagitic writings in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, we need not mention the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, which is especially proud of him; but neither in the West was a voice raised in challenge down to the first half of the fifteenth century; on the contrary, his works were regarded as exceedingly valuable and even as sacred. It was believed that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who had communicated his revelations to his disciple in Athens, spoke through these writings (Histor.-polit. Blatter, CXXV, 1900, p. 541). As there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning the fact itself, a glance at the main divisions of the tradition may suffice. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> received the original text of the Areopagitica undoubtedly through Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The oppressions on the part of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> during the sixth and seventh centuries compelled many Greek and Oriental <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to abandon their homes and settle in Italy. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was built under <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> and <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a>. It was also <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> (757-767) who in 757 sent the writings of Dionysius together with other books, to Pepin in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> (772-795) also mentioned Dionysius as a <em>testis gravissimus</em> in a letter accompanying the Latin translation of the Acts of the Nicaean Council (787) which he sent to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. During the first half of the ninth century the facts concerning Dionysius are mainly grouped around the Abbot Hilduin of Saint-Denys at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Through the latter the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the Gallic <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Dionysius of the third century, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint-Denys, was identical with the Areopagite rose to an undoubted <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, while the works ascribed to Dionysius gained in repute. Through a legation from Constantinople, Michael II had sent several gifts to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Emperor Louis the Pious (827), and among them were the writings of the Areopagite, which gave particular <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Hilduin, the influential arch-chaplain of Louis. Hilduin took care to have them translated into Latin and he himself wrote a life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> (P.L., CVI, 13 sq.). About the year 858 <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Eriugena, who was versed in Greek, made a new Latin translation of the Areopagite, which became the main source from which the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> obtained a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Dionysius and his doctrines. The work was undertaken at the instance of Charles the Bald, at whose court <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> enjoyed great influence (P.L., CXXII, 1026 sq.; cf. Traube, "Poet. lat. aev. Carol.", II, 520, 859 sq.). Compared with Hilduin's, this second translation marks a decided step in advance. <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, with his keen <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> skill and his soaring speculative mind, found in the Areopagite a kindred spirit. Hence, despite many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of translation due to the obscurity of the Greek original, he was able to grasp the connections of thought and to penetrate the problems. As he accompanied his translations with explanatory notes and as, in his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings, particularly in the work "De divisione naturae", (P.L., CXXII), he recurs again and again to Dionysius, it is readily seen how much he did towards securing recognition for the Areopagite.

<p>The works of Dionysius, thus introduced into Western literature, were readily accepted by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">medieval Scholastics</a>. The great masters of Saint-Victor at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, foremost among them the much admired Hugh, based their teaching on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Dionysius. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> and the great <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> scholars, <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, Bonaventure, adopted his theses and arguments. Master poets, e.g. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, and historians, e.g. <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freising</a>, built on his foundations. Scholars as renowned as <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a> of Lincoln and <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> drew upon him freely. Popular religious books, such as the "Legenda aurea" of Giacomo da Voragine and the "Life of Mary" by Brother Philip, gave him a cordial welcome. The great mystics, <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhardt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a>, and others, entered the mysterious obscurity of Dionysius with holy reverence. In rapid succession there appeared a number of translations: Latin translations by Joannes Sarrazenus (1170), <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a> (about 1220), Thomas Vercellensis (1400), Ambrosius Camaldulensis (1436), Marsilius Ficinus (1492); in the sixteenth century those of <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Faber Stapulensis</a>, Perionius, etc. Among the commentaries that of Hugh of Saint-Victor is notable for its warmth, that of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> for its extent, that of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> for its accuracy, that of Denys the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> for its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> spirit and its masterly inclusion of all previous commentaries.

<p>It was reserved for the period of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> to break with the time-honoured tradition. True, some of the older Humanists, as Pico della Mirandola, Marsilius Ficinus, and the Englishmen John Colet, were still convinced of the genuineness of the writings; but the keen and daring critic, Laurentius Valla (1407-1457) in his glosses to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, expressed his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> quite openly and thereby gave the impulse, at first for the scholarly <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> (1504), and later on for the entire scientific world, to take sides either with or against Dionysius. The consequence was the formation of two camps; among the adversaries were not only <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (<a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, Scultetus, Dallaeus, etc.) but also prominent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (Beatus Rhenanus, Cajetan, Morinus, <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a>, <a href="../cathen/09151b.htm">Le Nourry</a>); among the defenders of Dionysius were <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Lansselius, <a href="../cathen/04359a.htm">Corderius</a>, Halloix, Delario, de Rubeis, <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, Alexander Netalis, and others. The literary controversy assumed such dimensions and was carried on so vehemently that it can only be compared to the dispute concerning the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidorian decretals</a> and the pseudo-Constantinian donation. In the nineteenth century the general opinion inclined more and more towards the opposition; the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> especially, M&ouml;hler, <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler</a>, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, <a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a>, Funk, and others made no reserve of their decision for the negative. At this juncture the scholarly professor Franz Hipler came forward and attempted to save the honor of Dionysius. He finds in Dionysius not a falsifier, but a prominent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the fourth century who, through no fault of his own, but owing to the misinterpretation of some passages, was confounded with the Areopagite. Many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as well, voiced their approval. Finally, in 1895 there appeared almost simultaneously two independent researches, by Hugo Koch and by Joseph Stiglmayr, both of whom started from the same point and arrived at the same goal. The conclusion reached was that extracts from the treatise of the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a> Proclus, "De malorum subsistentia" (handed down in the Latin translation of Morbeka, Cousin ed., Paris, 1864), had been used by Dionysius in the treatise "De div. nom." (c. iv, sections 19-35) A careful analysis brought to light an astonishing agreement of both works in arrangement, sequence of thought, examples, figures, and expressions. It is easy to point out many parallelisms from other and later writings of Proclus, e.g. from his "Institutio theologica", "theologia Platonica", and his commentary on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Parmenides", "Alcibiades I", and "Timaeus" (these five having been written after 462).

<p>Accordingly, the long-standing problem seems to be solved in its most important phase. As a matter of fact, this is the decision pronounced by the most competent judges, such as Bardenhewer, Erhard, Funk, <a href="../cathen/04785b.htm">Diekamp</a>, Rauschen, De Smedt, S.J., Duchesne, Battifol; and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars of <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian literature</a>, Gelzer, Harnack, Kruger, Bonwetsch. The <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> being thus determined, an explanation was readily found for the various objections hitherto alleged, viz. the silence of the early Fathers, the later dogmatic terminology, a developed monastic, ceremonial, and penitential system, the echo of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>, etc. On the other hand it sets at rest many hypotheses which had been advanced concerning the author and his times and various discussions---whether, e.g., a certain Apollinaris, or Synesius, or Dionysius Alexandrinus, or a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ptolemais, or a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> hierophant was the writer.

<p>A critical edition of the text of the Areopagite is urgently needed. The Juntina (1516), that of Basle (1539), of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1562 and 1615), and lastly the principal edition of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> (1634) by <a href="../cathen/04359a.htm">Corderius, S.J.</a>, which was frequently reprinted (Paris, 1644, 1755, 1854) and was included in the <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> collection (P.G., III and IV with Lat. trans. and additions), are insufficient because they make use of only a few of the numerous Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and take no account of the Syriac, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Arabic translations. The following translations have thus far appeared in modern languages: English, by Lupton (London, 1869) and Parker (London, 1894), both of which contain only the "Cael. Hierarchia" and the "Eccles. Hier."; German, by Engelhardt (Sulzbach, 1823) and Storf, "Kirkliche Hierarchie" (Kempten, 1877); French, by <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Darboy</a> (Paris, 1845) and Dulac (Paris, 1865).
