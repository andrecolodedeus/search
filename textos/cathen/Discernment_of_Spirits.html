<h1>Discernment of Spirits</h1>  

<p>All moral conduct may be summed up in the rule: avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and do good. In the language of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> asceticism, <em>spirits</em>, in the broad sense, is the term applied to certain complex influences, capable of impelling the will, the ones toward good, the others toward <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; we have the wordly spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the spirit of race, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, etc. However, in the restricted sense, <em>spirits</em> indicate the various spiritual agents which, by their suggestions and movements, may influence the moral value of our acts.

<p>Here we shall speak only of this second kind. They are reduced to four, including, in a certain way, the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, because in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original Fall</a>, its lower faculties are at variance with its superior powers. Concupiscence, that is to say, disturbances of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of sensibility, thwart or pervert the operations of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, by deterring the one from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the other from the good (<a href="../bible/gen008.htm#vrs21">Genesis 8:21</a>; <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs14">James 1:14</a>). In opposition to our vitiated nature, or so to speak, to the <em>flesh</em> which drags us into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> acts within us by grace, a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> help given to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will to lead us back to good and to the observance of the moral law (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs22">Romans 7:22-25</a>). Besides these two spirits, the human and the Divine, in the actual order of Providence, two others must be observed. The Creator willed that there should be communication between <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, and as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are of two kinds, good and bad, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">the latter</a> try to win us over to their rebellion and the former endeavour to make us their companions in obedience. Hence four spirits lay siege to our liberty: the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Divine</a> seeking its good, and the human (in the sense heretofore mentioned) and the diabolical its misery. In ordinary language they may, for brevity sake, be called simply the good and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>.

<p>"Discernment of spirits" is the term given to the judgment whereby to determine from what spirit the impulses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> emanate, and it is easy to understand the importance of this judgment both for self-direction and the direction of others. Now this judgment may be formed in two ways. In the first case the discernment is made by means of an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> light which <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> discovers the quality of the movement; it is then a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>, a grace <em>gratis data</em>, vouchsafed mainly for the benefit of our neighbour (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). This <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charisma</a> or gift was granted in the early Church and in the course of the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as, for example, <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>. Second, discernment of spirits may be obtained through study and reflection. It is then an acquired <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, more or less perfect, but very useful in the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. It is procured, always, of course, with the assistance of grace, by the reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a>, of works on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and asceticism, of autobiographies, and the correspondence of the most distinguished ascetics. The necessity of self-direction and of directing others, when one had charge of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, produced documents, preserved in spiritual <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, from the perusal of which one may see that the discernment of spirits is a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> that has always flourished in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In addition to the special treatises enumerated in the bibliography the following documents may be cited for the history of the subject: <ul><li>the "Shepherd of Hermas" (1, II, Mand. VI, c. 2); <li>St. Anthony's discourse to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in his life by St. Anthanasius; <li>the "De perfectione spirituali" (ch. 30-33) by Marcus Diadochus; <li>the "Confessions" of St. Augustine; <li><a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard's</a> XXIII sermon, "De discretione spirituum"; <li><a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson's</a> treatise, "De diversis diaboli tentationibus"; <li>St. Theresa's autobiography and "Castle of the Soul"; <li>St. Francis de Sales' letters of direction, etc. </ul>

<p>An excellent lesson is that given by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a> in his <a href="../cathen/14224b.htm">"Spiritual Exercises"</a>. Here we find rules for the discernment of spirits and, being clearly and briefly formulated, these rules indicate a secure course, containing in embryo all that is included in the more extensive treatises of later date. For a complete explanation of them the best commentaries on the "Exercises" of St. Ignatius may be consulted. Of the rules transmitted to us by a saint inspired by Divine light and a learned <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologist</a> taught by personal experience, it will suffice to recall the principal ones. Ignatius gives two kinds and we must call attention to the fact that in the second category, according to some opinions, he sometimes considers a more delicate discernment of spirits adapted to the extraordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Be that as it may, he begins by enunciating this clear principle, that both the good and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> act upon a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according to the attitude it assumes toward them. If it pose as their friend, they flatter it; if to resist them, they torment it. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> speaks only to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the senses, whereas the good spirit acts upon reason and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> labours to excite <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, the good to intensify <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Of course it may happen that a perfectly well-disposed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers from the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> deprived of the sustaining consolations of the good angel; but this is only a temporary trial the passing of which must be awaited in patience and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. St. Ignatius also teaches us to distinguish the spirits by their mode of action and by the end they seek. Without any preceding cause, that is to say, suddenly, without previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or sentiment, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, by virtue of His sovereign dominion, can flood the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with light and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But if there has been a preceding cause, either the good or the bad angel may be the author of the consolation; this remains to be judged from the consequences. As the good angel's object is the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the bad angel's its defects or unhappiness, if, in the progress of our thoughts all is well and tends to good there is no occasion for uneasiness; on the contrary, if we perceive any deviation whatsoever towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or even a slight unpleasant agitation, there is reason to fear. Such, then, is the substance of these brief rules which are nevertheless so greatly admired by the masters of the spiritual life. Although requiring an authorized explanation, when well understood, they act as a preservative against many illusions.
