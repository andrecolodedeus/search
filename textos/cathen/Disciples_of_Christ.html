<h1>Disciples of Christ</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> founded in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> by Alexander Campbell. Although the largest portion of his life and prodigious activity was spent in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Alexander Campbell was born, 12 September, 1788, in the County Antrim, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> side he was of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> extraction; his mother, Jane Corneigle, was of <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> descent. Both <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are reported to have been <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and high literary culture. His father, after serving as minister to the Anti-Burgher Church in Ahorey and director of a prosperous academy at Richhill, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and engaged in the oft-attempted and ever futile effort "to unite All Christians as one communion on a purely scriptural basis", the hallucination of so many noble minds, the only outcome of which must always be against the will of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>, to increase the discord of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> by the creation of a new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In 1808 Alexander embarked with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to join his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, but was shipwrecked on the Scottish coast and took the opportunity to prepare himself for the ministry at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>. In 1809 he migrated to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and found in Washington County, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the nucleus of the new movement in the "Christian Association of Washington", under the auspices of which was issued a "Declaration and Address", setting forth the objects of the association. It was proposed "to establish no new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, but to persuade <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to abandon party names and creeds, sectarian usages and denominational strifes, and associate in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellowship, in the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a divine Lord, with no other terms of religious communion than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in and obedience to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>".

<p>An independent church was formed at Brush Run on the principles of the association, and, 1 January, 1812, Alexander was "ordained". His earnestness is attested by the record of one hundred and six sermons preached in one year; but he wrecked every prospect of success by finding in his reading of the Scriptures the invalidity of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the necessity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by immersion, thus excluding from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">discipleship</a> the vast majority of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. On 12 June, 1812, with his wife, father, mother, and three others, Alexander was rebaptized by immersion. Nothing was left him now but to seek association with one or other of the numerous <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. This he did, but with the proviso that he should be allowed to preach and teach whatever he learned from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> never took him cordially; and in 1817, after five years of herculean labours, his followers, whom he wished to be known by the appellation of "Disciples of Christ", but who were generally styled "Campbellites", numbered only one hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Campbell's mission as a messenger of peace was a failure; as time went on he developed a polemical nature, and became a sharp critic in speech and in writing of the weaknesses and vagaries of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Only once did he come in direct contact with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, on the occasion of his five days' debate, in 1837, with <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, which excited great interest at the time but is now forgotten. His sixty volumes are of no interest. Campbell was twice married and was the father of twelve children. He died at <a href="../cathen/02531a.htm">Bethany</a>, <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>, where he had established a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 4 March, 1866.

<p>According to their census prepared in 1906 the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> then had 6475 <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, 11,633 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and a membership of 1,235,294. It is strongest in the West and Southwest, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> having the largest bodies. J.H. Garrison, editor of their organ "The Christian Evangelist", outlined (1906) the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. <ul><li>According to their investigations of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made by <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> declared he would build His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, namely "Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God", was the creed of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the essential <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that all those who would make this confession from the heart, being penitent of their past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, were to be admitted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into the membership of the early Church; <li>that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the early Church consisted of a burial of a penitent believer in the water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and that only such were fit subjects for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; <li>that the form of church government was congregational; <li>that each congregation had its <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and elders or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the former to look after the temporal and the latter the spiritual interests of the church. <li>They practise weekly communion and consider it not as a sacrament but as a memorial feast. <li>While they hold both New and Old Testaments to be equally inspired, both are not equally binding upon <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <li>Accepting the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as an all-sufficient revelation of the Divine will, they repudiate all authoritative creeds and human grounds of fellowship. </ul>
