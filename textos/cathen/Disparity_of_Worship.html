<h1>Disparity of Worship</h1>  

<p>(<em>Disparitas Cultus</em>)

<p>A diriment impediment introduced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the Sacrament of Marriage. To effect this purpose a law was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that would debar <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from contracting marriage with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unfit to receive the sacrament. The unfitness consists in <ul> <li>either non-reception of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>, which is the door to the other six <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; or <li>in an unbelief in the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of marriage or in either or both of its essential properties (unity and indissolubility); or <li>in a profession of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> or unbelief that endangers the three ends and threefold substantial <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> or advantages of this "great sacrament &hellip; in Christ and the church". </ul> This unfitness, in whole or in part, is to be found in all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and worship. Disparity of worship, in a general way, signifies a difference of religion or worship between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. This state of disagreement may be antecedent to, or consequent upon, their marriage. Consequent disparity occurs in the case of two <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> or unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, one of whom, becoming a convert, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> or validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> after marriage. The marriage is not affected by this consequent disparity of religion. Another species of consequent diversity of worship which does not militate against the marriage is that of two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, one of whom after their union apostatizes, or turns infidel, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, etc. Antecedent disparity is twofold: considered in its strict and proper sense it is called perfect disparity of worship, or simply disparity of worship, and implies a different relation on the part of the contracting parties in the matter of an essential religious rite, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. Viewed in a less strict, but still a proper, sense, it is named imperfect disparity of worship or, more commonly, mixed religion (<em>mixta religio</em>), which presupposes an equality as to the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but denotes a divergency as to form of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and religious observance. Imperfect disparity, or mixed relgion, does not render void the marriage of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> non-Catholic; but it does make it (unless <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> intervenes) illicit and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. However, such a marriage may be null and void on account of another diriment impediment, e.g. <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestinity</a>.

<p>Disparity of worship, in its strict sense, and as the subject of this article, is that diversity which exists between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, one of whom has, and the other has certainly not, received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Christian baptism</a>. This disparity exists between a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or non-Catholic, and a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, or even a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> (believer in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> yet not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>). Imperfect disparity of worship, or mixed religion, might more strictly and aptly be named disparity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (an internal act), and not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is the point of difference; perfect disparity of worship, on the contrary, might more aptly and properly be called disparity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for the reason that the external act (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>), and not the internal assent of the mind (faith), is the fixed point of dissimilarity. Baptism has been chosen as the basis of this diriment impediment for a twofold reason: <ul> <li>it is an external <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, easy of recognition and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and <li>it is a sacrament which imprints an indelible character upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the receiver and so presents a personal religious condition which is fixed and unchangeable. </ul> Personal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on the contrary, viewed either as the internal assent of the mind or as the outward profession of the internal act, is subject to change and not always easy of demonstration, and hence could not afford a certain and immovable foundation. The primary reason why <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are debarred from intermarriage with unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is because the latter are not capable of receiving the Sacrament of Matrimony, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the door to all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Furthermore, according to the more probable opinion, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party who, with a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, marries an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, does not receive the sacrament or the concomitant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> (cf. Sanchez, Bk. II, disp. viii, n. 2; <a href="../cathen/12108a.htm">Pirhing</a>, Bk. IV, tit. i, n. 71; <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Schmalzgr&uuml;ber</a>, Bk. IV, tit. i, n. 307; Billot, "De Ecclesi&aelig; Sacramentis", pars posterior, 359 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, III, 538, n. 598; and Wernz, who examines the reasons for the opposite opinion and answers them, "Jus Decret.", IV, 63 sqq.). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not decided this question; hence the opinion of Dominicus <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">de Soto</a> (In IV Sent., art. iii, <em>ad finem</em>), <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> (II, 306), Rosset, who holds that it is the more probable (De Sacr. Matrimonii, I, 284 sqq.), and Tanquerey (Synopsis Theol. Dogmat., II, 648, n. 31), to wit, that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> does receive the sacrament, is tenable. The marriage, according to both opinions, is certainly sacred (<a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Arcanum", 10 Feb., 1880) and indissoluble.


<h2>Extent of the impediment</h2>

<p>This impediment exists only in instances where the disparity is of such nature that one of the contracting parties is, and the other party is certainly not, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, is subject to this disqualifying and annulling impediment, because Christ gave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all who belong to it by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Under the name "Catholic" are here included, besides practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as infants in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but never reared or instructed in her teachings, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who have fallen away or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and have joined other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> or turned infidel. Once <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> always <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and always subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> Church, is axiomatic. Disparity of worship embraces and renders null and void (no <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> having been granted) the marriage <ul> <li>of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, and <li>of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> non-Catholics, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, with unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. </ul> It does not extend to, or make void, the marriage <ul> <li>of two certainly unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, for, since they do not belong to Christ by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over them; <li>of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> turned infidel; <li>of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> non-Catholics with one another. </ul> Seeing that the parties in the second and third classes have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it is evident that their marriages are outside the domain of the diriment impediment, whose aim is to protect the sacrament.

<p>Difficulties as to the marriages of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with non-Catholics, and of non-Catholics with one another, or with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> or other unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have in these days multiplied, due either to absolute omission of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or its careless and often invalid administration even among the so-called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> about the administration (<em>dubium facti</em>) or valid administration (<em>dubium juris</em>) of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> are as a consequence frequent, and render complex the question whether or not disparity of worship covers the marriages in these instances. The safe guide in this confusion is the axiom: a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as regards a marriage already, or about to be celebrated, is presumed to be valid if, after due investigation, the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is still insoluble or it is not prudent (on account of delay, etc.) to remove it. This rule, so different from that governing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is based upon the principle that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to marry yields but to the evidence (not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>) of the non-baptism. Accordingly, disparity of worship invalidates the matrimonial union of one doubtfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with another certainly not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> may concern the act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> or the validity of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Investigation on these points must proceed in this manner: search must be made of the ritual belonging to the denomination of the party concerning whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> there is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and if the ritual teaches the necessity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and prescribes the use of the valid <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form in its administration, and, further, if the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are strict adherents and observers of their religion, there is a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (sufficient for marriage) that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was valid. If the ritual prescribes <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, but, upon investigation, a serious <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> remains, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is still considered valid. If, on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> repudiates <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, forbids infant-baptism, or admits to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> only adults of thirty years, or the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> assert that they do not belong or wish to belong to any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> or denomination, but are satisfied with pleasing the Supreme Being by a good, moral life rather than by any fixed form of worship, then there is no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, not even a presumption, in favour of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in childhood. Should the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> be careless and negligent in the observances of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of which they are members, or belong to a denomination which, whilst not rejecting <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, yet does not admit its necessity, and in which, ordinarily, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not administered, then there is no presumption for or against the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of their offspring, and each individual case must be referred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Congreg. of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, 1 Aug., 1883).

<p>Disparity of worship does not affect the marriage of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> non-Catholic with one whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, even after careful investigation concerning the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> or its validity, remains <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. Neither does it in any way influence the marriage of two who, after diligent examination, are still considered doubtfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. There is a difference of opinion among the jurists and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as to the influence of this diriment impediment upon the marriage of two doubtfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if after investigation it turns out for a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that one was certainly unbaptized. The more common opinion is that disparity of worship does not nullify this marriage. Gasparri gives as reason that the consuetudinary law never contemplated this case, and hence does not influence it (De Matrimonio, I, nos. 597 and 601). Wernz (IV, 772, note), Gury-Ballerini (II, 831), and others say that the marriage is valid, but give as reason the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, either special or general. Lehmkuhl (II, 536) distinguishes and asserts that if a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the prohibitive impediment of "mixed religion" has been granted antecedent to the marriage, the union is valid; his reason, however, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in dispensing with the prohibitive did not implicitly dispense with the diriment impediment, seems to be at variance with a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office (29 April, 1840, n. 2) which clearly states that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> dispenses with the impediment of disparity of worship only in express terms. Where no <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> has been granted, he holds that the marriage is null on account of the existing disparity of worship and must be revalidated. He recognizes, however, as valid the marriage of the doubtfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if they had been considered and had considered themnselves <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and had followed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practices, and afterwards it was discovered that one of them had not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (loc. cit. in note).
<h2>Origin of the impediment</h2>

<p>This impediment, inasmuch as it is diriment, is not enjoined by the natural, Divine, or written ecclesiastical law, but has been introduced by a universal custom and practice in the Eastern and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> since the twelfth century. The natural and Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> do, however, repudiate and prohibit such marriages as tend to frustrate the primary ends of marriage by exposing believers and their offspring to the loss of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this prohibition continues in force so long as the danger exists and no proportionately grave cause dictates the necessity of such marriage. The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#vrs3">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>) prohibits marriage between the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> (who kept the Law and had the Book of Moses), on account of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenish</a> ceremonies they observed, lest the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> might be turned away from the service of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> and cling to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods of their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> wives. The Pauline injunctions (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs39">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>), "&hellip; let her marry to whom she will but only in the Lord" and (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#vrs14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>): "&hellip; bear not the yoke with [i.e. do not marry] unbelievers", do not, indeed, declare invalid the marriages of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with unbelievers, but certainly do earnestly forbid the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to marry unbelievers unless the ends of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> are safeguarded and grave and weighty reasons exist for the union. Certainly in the time of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and immediately afterwards the proportionately small number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was sufficiently grave cause for permitting such intermarriages with the hope of the conversion of the unbelieving partner.

<p>With the development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its growth in numbers, opportunities for <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> increased, proportionately grave reasons for mixed unions (unless in rare cases) ceased, and then the natural and Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> asserted their right to prohibit such marriages as tended to frustrate the ends of the matrimonial sacrament by exposing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to a weakening or loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the offspring to a lack of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to a want of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian love</a> which is its very <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">Christian laity</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, realized from sad experience and observation the ordinary tendency of mixed unions to a compromise or loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the un-Catholic bringing-up or at least <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>, of the children, and, finally, injury to domestic peace and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by the constant exposure to disputes, and sometimes bitter quarrels, about the fundamental principles of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and the consequent weakening, if not total extinction, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian love</a> between husband and wife (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, De Abraham, Bk. I, ch. ix, says: "There can be no unity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> where there is no unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"). At different periods and in different countries (especially <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Gaul) particular councils inveighed against them, and although these canons were not strictly observed, and there were many <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> in the days of Sts. Jerome (Lib. I in Jovinianum) and Augustine (Lib. de Fide et operibus, ch. xix), yet after the death of the latter, and especially from the seventh to the twelfth century, the detestation of them so increased, and the conviction that they were not <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriages</a>, and therefore to be shunned and not contracted, grew so strong and general throughout the entire Church that as far back as the twelfth century it was a universal custom and practice which even had the force of a universal church law (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, De Controversiis, III, De Sacramento Matrimonii, Bk. I, ch. xxiii; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, Constit. "Singulari nobis", paragraphs 9 and 10).

<p>This impediment is binding on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of newly converted or even <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries, where there has been no such custom inasmuch as there have been no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The opinion of <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> and others to the contrary is clearly refuted by the granting of faculties by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> to dispense with this impediment in the cases of newly converted <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists say that there is one exception to this nullifying law, and that is the instance of an emigrant <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> settled in a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> country without a single <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> neighbour, forty or fifty days journey removed from the nearest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and unable on account of the distance or want of means to leave the country or procure a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the impediment, and thus compelled to remain their whole lives single or marry <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> (Santi-Leitner, IV, 74; Gasparri, De Matrimonio, I, 429). It does not seem that disparity of worship holds in a case of this kind; the ecclesiastical law under such circumstances does not bind a man so as to deprive him of his natural right to marry. Wernz, however (Jus Decret., IV, 775, n. 37), holds the opposite opinion.
<h2>Dispensation from the impediment</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can dispense from this impediment inasmuch as it is of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution. It never does so unless for gravest reasons and upon the fulfillment of certain conditions and guarantees that safeguard, as far as possible, the ends of the Sacrament of Matrimony. The natural and Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> before permitting <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, exact the removal of all danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bringing-up of all of the children of the marriage. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot dispense with this <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> requirement, and, the better to ensure its presence, insists upon certain conditions and promises, which must be committed to writing and signed and, in some instances and countries, also sworn to, by the unbaptized party to the pact. The unbeliever promises faithfully to comply with the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on her part grants the permission for the marriage. The promises on the part of the unbaptized party are: <ul> <li>that he (or she) will afford the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> partner full and perfect freedom to practise the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and that he (or she) will abstain from saying or doing aught to weaken or change that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and, if he be an inhabitant of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> country, that he will not practise <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>; <li>that he (or she) will permit all children of their union to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and reared in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and practice, and that he (or she) will do or say nothing calculated to lessen their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or turn them away from it or its practices. </ul> The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> petitioner for the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> must also give promise (usually also written, in order that the dispenser may have a moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the absence of danger to the substantial ends of the sacrament) that he (or she) will strictly attend to his (or her) personal religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and have all the children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and properly reared and trained in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice, and that by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and good example and other legitimate and prudent means he (or she) will constantly labour to bring about the conversion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of his (or her) unbaptized partner. The promise to strive to effect the conversion of the unbeliever is of special importance, although too frequently lost sight of. The conversion most assuredly eliminates the last vestige of possible perversion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, ensures the primary end of marriage, i.e., the bearing and rearing of children for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and rounds out, by the perfect unity of the married couple in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian love</a>, their marriage according to its great type, the union of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even with all these promises, written and sworn to as safeguards to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> cannot be licitly given unless a grave necessity proportionate to the great risks to be encountered, justifies the marriage.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, in former days very rarely granted in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, is now of more frequent occurrence, owing to the existence of "civil marriage" and the growing indifference on the part of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in the matter of their children's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was, and is, not to grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from this impediment unless in provinces or countries where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are largely outnumbered by the non-baptized inhabitants. Rather than dispense from the disparity of worship, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will more willingly and readily grant <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the diriment impediments of affinity and <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>, precisely for the reason that in the latter cases there is no danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of either <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or offspring, while in the case of the former, even though the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> promises are made and kept, there is always danger of <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> parent, and especially of the children on account of the example of the non-baptized parent. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone <em>sui jure</em> can dispense with this impediment; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cannot. They, however, are <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> to do so, but in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name and by virtue of the delegated authority. Thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries&mdash;China, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, etc.&mdash;and in countries where the unbaptized largely outnumber the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, etc., have ample faculties in respect of this impediment. Today the only case (and should there be danger in delay it is not: see Formula T, 11 June, 1907) reserved to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the faculties granted to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is that of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, i.e. a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> follower of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. The case of a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> uncircumcised, or even <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> if he has abandoned <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, is not reserved.

<p>This delegated faculty to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is given only for a specified period of five years or for a certain number of cases and requires that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in granting a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> must state that it was conceded by virtue of Apostolic delegation of specified date. Where the impediment is occult, and there is danger in delay, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may dispense without express faculty of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which in such cases is presumed to grant it. All <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can (decrees of Congreg. of Inquis., 20 Feb., 1888, and 1 March, 1889) dispense, and delegate the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to dispense, from the impediment of disparity of worship in the case of one who is in danger of death but is only civilly married or lives in <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>. The aforesaid promises cannot be omitted. The sick party must promise absolutely to observe the requirements of the natural and Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and to carry out the injunctions of the ecclesiastical law as far as possible (Collectanea S. C. de Prop. Fide, n. 2188). Bishops cannot dispense in instances where the ends, purposes, and substantial <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the sacrament are well protected, unless there also exists a grave and proportionately weighty reason. There are sixteen canonical reasons, some grave and others still more grave (Instruct. S. C. de Prop. Fide, 9 May, 1877). Should the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> dispense without cause, the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> would be null and void. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, in a similar case labouring under the same defect, would be valid. The reason of this difference is that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot violate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of his superior (in this instance the universal law), whereas the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who is supreme legislator, can dispense from universal ecclesiastical laws. He cannot, however, do so validly with the prohibition of the natural and Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; hence he must have, before conceding the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, a moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that the practice of the Faith by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and rearing of the children, are amply protected. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> dispenses from this impediment only for the gravest reasons and only in express terms (Collectanea S. C. de Prop. Fide, n. 948, 2); hence a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from mixed religion instead of disparity of worship would not suffice for the validity of the marriage.

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Governments (except <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>) ignore this impediment. The Austrian impediment is different from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> impediment. Its basis is the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the parties, and so far as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is concerned, this civil impediment is more injurious than otherwise. According to the Austrian law, the marriage of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, or other unbaptized party, is civilly invalid as long as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> remains in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Should the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and announce that he (or she) held no <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in any <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the marriage with an unbaptized partner would be civilly valid. Unbaptized parties can, on the other hand, enter into civilly valid marriage with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in granting <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from disparity of worship, thus permitting the marriage of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and an unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by that act dispenses also from all impediments of purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution, from which the unbaptized is exempt (except <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestinity</a>; cf. "Praxis Curi&aelig; Roman&aelig;"; "Ne Temere", 2 Aug., 1907); the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does this in order that the exemption of the unbaptized may, on account of the indissolubility of the marriage, be communicated to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party (Congreg. of Inquis., 3 March, 1825). This <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> never includes <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in any degree in the direct line nor in the first degree of the transverse line (Gasparri, op. cit., nos 700, 701). This impediment, which is <em>publici juris</em>, can be invoked by any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to annul a marriage contracted without the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. The burden of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> rests upon the challenger, who must clearly demonstrate that there was either no act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> administration or that the act of administration which actually took place was certainly invalid. The usual canonical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of evidence are supplemented by special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> laid down for the demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> or the validity of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The customary norm (c. iii, X, De presby. non-bap., III, xliii) in case of practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> does not govern the cases of non-Catholics or negligent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The rules prescribed by the Congreg. of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (1 Aug., 1883, and 5 Feb., 1851) for the verification of the fact or non-fact of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as also of the validity of the act, must be strictly followed.
