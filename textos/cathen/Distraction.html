<h1>Distraction</h1>  

<p>Distraction (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>distrahere</em>, to draw away, hence to distract) is here considered in so far as it is wont to happen in time of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and in administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. It hardly needs to be noted that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and mind-wandering are destructive of each other. So far as vocal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is concerned, the want of actual interior attention, if <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, will take from its perfection and be morally reprehensible. Distractions, however, according to the commonly accepted teaching, do not rob <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of its essential character. To be sure one must have had the intention to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and therefore in the beginning some formal advertence; otherwise a man would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he was doing, and his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> could not be described even as a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a>. So long, however, as nothing is done outwardly which would be incompatible with any degree whatever of attention to the function of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the lack of explicit <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> application does not, so to speak, invalidate <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In other words, it keeps its substantial value as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, although, of course, when the dissipation of thought is wilful our addresses to the throne of mercy lose a great deal of efficacy and acceptability. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has an application, for example, in the case of those who are bound to recite the canonical Office and who are esteemed to have fulfilled their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> substantially even though their distractions have been abundant and absorbing. Voluntary distractions, that is the conscious deliberate surrender of the mind to thoughts foreign to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> because of the obvious irreverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with Whom at such times are presuming to hold intercourse. The guilt, however, is judged to be venial. In the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> their validity cannot be assailed merely because the one who confers them fails to, here and now, think of what he is doing. Provided he has the required intention and posits the essentials of the external rite proper to each sacrament, no matter how taken over he may be by outside reflections, his act is distinctly a human one and as such its value cannot be impugned. Such as state of mind, however, when it is wilful, is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, but the guilt is not mortal unless one has thereby laid himself open to the danger of making a mistake in what is regarded as essential for the validity of the sacrament in question.
