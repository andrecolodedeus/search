<h1>Divine Attributes</h1>  

<p>In order to form a more systematic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as far as possible, to unfold the implications of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is All-Perfect, this <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Perfection is viewed, successively, under various aspects, each of which is treated as a separate perfection and characteristic inherent to the Divine Substance, or Essence. A certain group of these, of paramount import, is called the Divine Attributes.
<h2 id="section1">Knowledge of God mediate and synthetic</h2>

<p>Our natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is acquired by discursive reasoning upon the data of sense by introspection, "For the invisible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; His eternal power also, and Divinity" (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs20">Romans 1:20</a>). Created things, by the properties and activities of their natures, manifest, as in a glass, darkly, the powers and perfections of the creator. But these refracted images of Him in finite things cannot furnish grounds for any adequate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Infinite Being. Hence, in constructing a synthetic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before one can apply to the Divinity any concept or term expressing a perfection found in created being, it must be subjected to rigorous correction. The profound disparity between the Divine perfection and the intimations of it presented in the world-copy may be broadly laid down under two heads: <ul><li><em>Number:</em> The perfections of creatures are innumerable, the Divine Perfection is one. <li><em>Diversity:</em> Created perfections differ endlessly in kind and degree; the Divine perfection is uniform, simple. It is not a totality of various perfections; absolutely simple, the Divine perfection answers to every <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of actual or conceivable perfection, without being determined to the particular mode of any. Hence, when any attribute expressing modes characteristic of the world of being that falls within the range of our experience is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> its signification ceases to be identical with that which it has in every other case. Yet it retains a real meaning in virtue of the ratio which exists between the finite being and its Infinite analogue. In <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> phrase, the use of terms is called analogical predication, in contra-distinction to univocal, in which a word is predicated of two or more subjects in precisely the same sense. (See <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">ANALOGY</a>.)</ul>
<h2 id="section2">Source of our natural knowledge of God</h2>

<p>To correct, as far as possible, the inadequate character of the concepts through which we must formulate our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first step is to distinguish created perfection into two kinds, viz., mixed perfections and pure perfections. A pure perfection is one whose exact concept does not include any note formally expressive of defect or limitation; the content of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is entirely positive. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a mixed perfection, on the contrary, formally or directly connotes, along with what is positive in the perfection, some privation or deficiency. Examples of the former are power, truthfulness, will; as an instance of the latter, materiality may be offered. For, though the reality that belongs to matter is, of course, a participation of existence and activity, yet the concept of it connotes the imperfections of that particular kind of existence which is composite and subject to disintegration. Again, <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> is a pure perfection; for, as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy teaches, though the finite character of human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> comes into play in the awakening of self-consciousness, yet limitation is not an essential constituent of <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. All terms that stand for pure perfections are predicated analogically of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are designated attributes in the wide sense of the word. When terms which signify mixed perfections are predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the analogy becomes so faint that the locution is a mere metaphor.
<h2 id="section3">Inductive development of attributes</h2>

<p>The elaboration of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is carried out along three converging lines.
<h3 id="A">The positive way of causality</h3>

<p>In virtue of the principle that whatever excellence is contained in an effect is represented in the efficiency of the cause, reason affirms that every positive perfection of created being has its <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> analogue in the first cause. Hence, from the existence of an intelligent being, man, in the cosmos, we rightly infer that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is intelligent, that is to say, His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfection is superabundantly adequate to all the operations of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.
<h3 id="B">The negative way</h3>

<p>If we fix our attention precisely on the Infinity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, focusing the negation not upon the positive content of any created perfection but upon the fact that, because it is finite it is determined in kind and limited in degree, we may affirm that it is not found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We may say, e.g., that He is not intelligent. The meaning of the statement is not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lacks intelligence but that in Him there is no intelligence exactly as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. Again, since there is no imperfection in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, every concept of defect, privation, and limitation must be negated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Many negative names, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, are applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as when, for instance, He is said to be immutable, uncaused, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. It should, however, be carefully observed that some attributes, which, from the etymological point of view are negative, convey, nevertheless, a positive meaning. Failure to perceive this obvious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been responsible for much empty dogmatism on the impossibility of forming any concept of the Infinite. The basic note in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Infinite is existence, actuality, perfection; the negative note is subordinate. Furthermore, since the force of the latter note is to deny any and all limitations to the actuality represented by the former, its real import is positive, like the cancellation of a minus sign in an algebraic formula; or, it discharges the function of an exponent and raises actuality to the nth power.
<h3 id="C">Way of eminence</h3>

<p>The concept of a perfection derived from created things and freed of all defects, is, in its application to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, expanded without limit. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only possesses every excellence discoverable in creation, but He also possesses it <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>. To emphasize the transcendence of the Divine perfection, in some cases an abstract noun is substituted for the corresponding adjective; as, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Intelligence; or, again, some word of intensive, or exclusive, force is joined to the attribute; as, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is good, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> itself, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is all-powerful, or supremely powerful.


<h2 id="section4">Deductive development</h2>

<p>Having established the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> from metaphysical, physical, and moral arguments, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> selects some one of the attributes which these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> authorize him to predicate of the Divinity and, by unfolding its implications, reaches a number of other attributes. For instance, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Pure Actuality, that is, free from all static potency, it follows that, since change implies a transition from an antecedent potential condition to a subsequent condition in which the potentiality is realized, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is immutable. Here we reach the point where the term Attribute is employed in its strict sense.
<h2 id="section5">Essence and attributes</h2>

<p>Transcendentally one, absolutely free from composition, the Divine Being is not, and may not be conceived as, a fundamental substrate in which qualities or any other modal indeterminations inhere. The reality to the various attributes are ascribed is one and indivisible.

<p>"Quae justitia," says <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "ipsa bonitas; quae bonitas, ipsa beatitudo."

<p>In this respect, the relation of the attributes to the Divine nature might be illustrated by the various reflections of one and the same object from a concave, a convex, and a plane mirror. Nevertheless, to systematize the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to draw out the rich content of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> resulting from the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, some primary attribute may be chosen as representing one aspect of the Divine perfection from which the others may be rigorously <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a>. Then arises a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> scheme in which the derivative attributes, or perfections stand towards one another in a relation somewhat similar to that of the essence and the various properties and qualities in a material substance. In this arrangement the primary perfection is termed the metaphysical essence, the others are called attributes. The essence, too, may be regarded as that characteristic which, above all others, distinguishes the Deity from everything else. Upon the question, which attribute is to be considered primary, opinions differ. Many eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> favour the conception of pure actuality (<em>Actus Purus</em>), from which simplicity and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> are directly <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a>. Most modern authors fix on <a href="../cathen/01774b.htm">aseity</a> (<em>Aseitas</em>; <em>a</em> = "from" <em>se</em> = "himself"), or self-existence; for the reason that, while all other existences are derived from, and depend on, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He possesses in Himself, absolutely and independently, the entire reason of His uncaused <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Being. In this, the most profound and comprehensive distinction between the Divinity and everything else, all other distinctions are implicitly expressed. Whether, and in what way, the distinctions between the attributes and the metaphysical essence, and among the attributes themselves have an ontological basis in the Divine nature itself was subject which divided <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> and Realists, <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, in the age of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> (cf. Vacant, Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cathol., I, 2230-34).
<h2 id="section6">Division of attributes</h2>

<p>Taking as the basis of classification the ways by which the attributes are developed, they are divided into positive and negative. Among the negative attributes are simplicity, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, immutability. The chief positive attributes are unity, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, beauty, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> omnipresence, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will, <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. Some authors divide them into incommunicable and communicable. The former class comprises those which belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone (e.g., all-wise, self-existent, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>) to the latter belong those which are predicable, analogically, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures as good, just, intelligent. Again, the divine nature considered either as static or as the source activity; hence another division into quiescent and active. Finally, some perfections involve a relation to things distinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while others do not; and from this standpoint <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> divide the attributes into absolute and relative. The various classifications adopted by modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are due partly to the results of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation and partly to new conceptions of the nature of religion. Schleiermacher, e.g., derives the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a> from our threefold consciousness of absolute dependence, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of grace. Others, with Lipsius, distinguish the metaphysical attributes from the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>. A simpler division groups <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, omnipresence, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, omniscience, and unity as the metaphysical predicates, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> as the moral attributes. The fundamental attribute is, according to <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; according to Professor Royce, omniscience. The main difficulty with these writers centres about the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">personal</a> being.
<h2 id="section7">Revelation</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> given in revelation is apprehended through the medium of conceptions that belong to natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore the same principles of attribution that govern the one hold good also for the other.
<h2 id="section8">Historical development</h2>

<p>In the fourth century A&euml;tius and <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a> maintained that, because the Divine nature is simple, excluding all composition or multiplicity, the various terms and names applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are to be considered synonymous. Otherwise they would <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> imply composition in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This opinion was combated by <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (<a href="../fathers/2902.htm"><em>Answer to Eunomius' Second Book</em> I.14</a>). The principle of attribution received more precise statement at the hands of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, in his investigation of the conditions of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (De Genesi ad Litteram, IV, 32). In the ninth century, John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena, who was largely influenced by <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a>, transmitted through the works of the <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, contributed to bring into clearer relief the analogical character of predication (De Divin&acirc; Natur&acirc;, Lib. I). The <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> revived the views of <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a>, and the opposition of the Realists was carried to the other extreme by Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e, who maintained a real, ontological distinction between the Divine Essence and the attributes. His opinion was condemned by the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1148). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> definitively expressed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which, after some controversies between <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a> and <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> upon minor points and subtleties, and with some divergence of opinion upon unimportant details, is now the common teaching of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. It may be summarized as follows: The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is derived from our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of finite beings. When a term is predicated of the finite and of the Infinite, it is used, not in a univocal, but in analogical sense. The Divine Perfection, one and invisible, is, in its <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> analogue of all actual and possible finite perfections. By means of an accumulation of analogous predicates methodically co-ordinated, we endeavour to form an approximate conception of the Deity who, because He is Infinite, cannot be comprehended by finite intelligence. Modern philosophy presents a remarkable gradation, from <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which finds <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in everything, to <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, which declares that He is beyond the reach of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> conceives <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as "a substance consisting of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> attributes each of which expresses eternal and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> essence". The two attributes manifested to us are thought and extension. At the other extreme we find <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Herbert Spencer (see <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">AGNOSTICISM</a>) and some followers of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, who hold that the nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or, to use their favourite term, "the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a>" is utterly unknowable, and its existence not determined to any mode; therefore, to predicate of it various attributes, expressive of determinations, is idle and misleading. Between the finite and the Infinite there is no common ground of predication, hence; words which signify finite perfections can have no real meaning when predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they become mere empty symbols. All <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> attempts to elaborate an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are vain, and result in complete absurdity when they conceive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after man's image and likeness (see <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">ANTHROPOMORPHISM</a>), and circumscribe the Infinite in terms borrowed from human <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>. Criticism of this kind indicates that its authors have never taken the trouble to understand the nature of analogical predication, or to consider fairly the rigorous <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> process of refining to which terms are subjected before being predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It often happens too, that writers, after indulging liberally in eloquent denunciation of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphism</a> proceed, on the next page, to apply to the Infinite, presumably in a strictly univocal sense, terms such as "energy", "force", and "law", which are no less <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphic</a>, in an ultimate analysis, than "will" and "intelligence". The position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> declared in the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215), is again clearly stated in the following pronouncement of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>: <blockquote> The Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> believes and professes that there is one living and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Creator and Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, eternal, immense, incomprehensible, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will and in all perfection Who, being One, singular, absolutely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, is to be regarded as distinct really and in essence from the world most blessed in and from Himself, and unspeakably elevated above all things that exist, or can be conceived, except Himself. </blockquote>
