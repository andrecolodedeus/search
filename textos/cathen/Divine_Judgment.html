<h1>Divine Judgment</h1>  

<p>This subject will be treated under two heads: <blockquote><p>I. Divine Judgment Subjectively and Objectively Considered; <br>II. Pre-Christian Beliefs Concerning Judgment after Death. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">Particular Judgment</a> and <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">General Judgment</a> will be treated in separate articles.
<h2 id="section1">Divine judgment subjectively and objectively considered</h2>

<p>Divine judgment (<em>judicium divinum</em>), as an immanent act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, denotes the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> retributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by which the destiny of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures is decided according to their merits and demerits. This includes: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the moral worth of the acts of free creatures (<em>scientia approbationis et reprobationis</em>), and His <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> determining the just consequences of such acts; <li>the Divine verdict upon a creature amenable to the moral law, and the execution of this sentence by way of reward and punishment.</ul> It is clear, of course, that the judgment, as it is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be a process of distinct and successive acts; it is a single eternal act identical with the Divine Essence. But the effects of the judgment, since they take place in creatures, follow the sequence of time. The Divine judgment is manifested and fulfilled at the beginning, during the progress, and at the end of time. In the beginning, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pronounced judgment upon the whole race, as a consequence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">the fall</a> of its representatives, the first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm">Genesis 3</a>). Death and the infirmities and miseries of this were the consequences of that original sentence. Besides this common judgment there have been special judgments on particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and peoples. Such great catastrophes as the flood (<a href="../bible/gen006.htm#vrs5">Genesis 6:5</a>), the destruction of Sodom (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#vrs20">Genesis 28:20</a>), the earthquake that swallowed up Core and his followers (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs30">Numbers 16:30</a>), the plagues of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<a href="../bible/exo006.htm#vrs6">Exodus 6:6</a>; <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#vrs12">12:12</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that came upon other oppressors of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/eze025.htm#vrs11">Ezekiel 25:11</a>; <a href="../bible/eze028.htm#vrs22">28:22</a>) are represented in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as Divine judgments. The fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is such a fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> that it insists mainly on the punitive aspect of the judgment (cf. <a href="../bible/pro011.htm#vrs31">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="../bible/eze014.htm#vrs21">Ezekiel 14:21</a>). An <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> view of these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> led many of the rabbis to teach that all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which befalls man is a special chastisement from on high, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which was declared <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>There is also a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the world that is subjective. By his acts man adheres to or deviates from the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, and thereby places himself within the sphere of approval or condemnation. In a sense, then, each individual exercises judgment on himself. Hence it is declared that Christ came not to judge but to save (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs17">John 3:17</a>; <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs15">8:15</a>; <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs47">12:47</a>). The internal judgment proceeds according to a man's attitude: towards Christ (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs18">John 3:18</a>). Though all the happenings of life cannot be interpreted as the outcome of Divine judgment, whose external manifestation is therefore intermittent, the subjective judgment is coextensive with the life of the individual and of the race. The judgment at the end of time will complement the previous visitations of Divine retribution and will manifest the final result of the daily secret judgment. By its sentence the eternal destiny of creatures will be decided. As there is a twofold end of time, so there is likewise a twofold eternal judgment: the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a>, at the hour of death, which is the end of time for the individual, and the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a>, at the final epoch of the world's existence, which is the end of time for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Pre-Christian beliefs concerning judgment after death</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a final readjustment beyond the grave, which would rectify the sharp contrast so often observed between the conduct and the fortune of men, was prevalent among all nations in pre-Christian times. Such was the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a> or the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as a justification of the ways of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to man, prevailing among the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> of all classes and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, the Pythagoreans, the Orphic mystics, and the Druids. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a forensic judgment in the unseen world, by which the eternal lot of departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is determined, was also widely prevalent in pre-Christian times.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the judgment is set forth with great precision of detail in the "Book of the Dead", a collection of formulae designed to aid the dead in their passage through the underworld (EGYPT). The Babylonians and the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> make no distinction between the good and the bad so far as the future habitation is concerned. In the Gilgames epic the hero is marked as judge of the dead, but whether his rule was the moral value of their actions is not clear. An unerring judgment and compensation in the future life was a cardinal point in the mythologies of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, Greeks, and Romans. But, while these mythological schemes were credited as strict verities by the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> body of the people, the learned saw in them only the allegorical presentation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. There were always some who denied the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a future life, and this unbelief went on increasing till, in the last days of the Republic, skepticism regarding <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> prevailed among Greeks and Romans.

<p>With the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. the judgment of the living was a far more prominent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> than the judgment of the dead. The <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> contains no express mention of remuneration in the future life, and it was only at a comparatively late period, under the influence of a fuller revelation, that the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and judgment began to play a capital part in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. The traces of this <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> development are plainly visible in the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> era. Then arose the two great opposing parties, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, whose divergent interpretations of Scripture led to heated controversies, especially regarding the future life. The <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> denied all reward and penalty in the hereafter, while there opponents encumbered the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with ludicrous details. Thus some of the rabbis asserted that the trumpet which would summon the world to judgment would be one of the horns of the ram which Abraham offered up instead of his son Isaac. Again they said: "When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> judges the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, He will stand, and make the judgment brief and mild; when He judges the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, he will sit and make it long and severe." Apart from such rabbinical fables, the current <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> reflected in the writings of the rabbis and the pseudographs at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> was that of a preliminary judgment and of a final judgment to occur at the consummation of the world, the former to be executed against the wicked by the personal prowess of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the latter to be pronounced as an eternal sentence by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a> of the individual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is lost sight of in the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">universal judgment</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> vindicate the wrongs endured by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. With Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, on the contrary, with that at least of which Philo is the exponent, the dominant <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that of an immediate retribution after death. The two dissenting <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, were in agreement with the majority of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as to the existence of a discriminating retribution in the life to come. The <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a> believed in the preexistence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but taught that the after-existence was an unchanging state of bliss or woe according to the deeds done in the body. The <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> tenets of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> were at first few and vague. Their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and of the day of vengeance and recompense was a <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> patterned after the model of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, and first formulated for the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> by its greatest <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, Marka (A.D. fourth century)
