<h1>Divine Providence</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Providentia</em>; Greek, <em>pronoia</em>).

<p>Providence in general, or foresight, is a function of the virtue of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and may be defined as the practical reason, adapting means to an end. As applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Providence is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself considered in that act by which in His wisdom He so orders all events within the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> that the end for which it was created may be realized. That end is that all creatures should manifest the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in particular that man should glorify Him, recognizing in nature the work of His hand, serving Him in obedience and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and thereby attaining to the full development of his nature and to eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is a system of real beings created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and directed by Him to this supreme end, the concurrence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all natural operations, whether of things animate or inanimate, and still more so for operations of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preserves the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> in being; He acts in and with every creature in each and all its activities. In spite of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is due to the wilful perversion of human liberty, acting with the concurrence, but contrary to the purpose and intention of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in spite of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is the consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He directs all, even <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, to the final end for which the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was created. All these operations on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> part, with the exception of creation, are attributed in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to Divine Providence.
<h2>The testimony of universal belief</h2>

<p>For all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, understood in the wider sense of a superhuman being who governs the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and directs the course of human affairs with definite purpose and beneficent design, has always been a very real and practical <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, divination, blessing and curse, <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> and sacred rite, all testify to a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in some over-ruling power, divine or quasi-divine in character; and such phenomena are found in every race and tribe, however uncivilized or degraded. We find it, for instance, not only amongst the savages of today, but also among the early Greeks, who, though they do not appear to have clearly distinguished between Providence and Fate, and though their gods were little more than glorified <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a>, subject to human frailty and marred by human passion, they none the less watched over the home and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, took sides in human <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>, and were the protectors and avengers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. The intimate connection of the gods with human affairs was even more marked in the religion of the early Romans, who had a special god to look after each detail of their daily life, their labours in the field, and the business of the state. The ancient <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the East present the same characteristics. Auramazda, the supreme god of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> during the period of the great kings, is the ruler of the world, the maker of kings and nations, who punishes the wicked and hearkens to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the good (see cuneiform inscriptions translated by Casartelli in the "Hist. of Relig.", II, 13 sq.). A similar notion prevailed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. All things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> gift. He loves the obedient and humbles the proud, rewards the good and smites the wicked (Renouf 100 sq.). Osiris, the king of the gods, judges the world according to his will, and to all nations, past, present, and future, gives his commands (op. cit., 218 sq.). Amon Ra-is, the lord of the thrones of the earth, the end of all existence, the support of all things, just of heart when one cries to him, deliverer of the poor and oppressed (op. cit., 225 sq.). Assyrian and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> records are no less clear. Marduk, the lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, shows mercy to all, implants fear in their hearts, and controls their lives; while Shamash directs the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">law of nature</a>, and is the supreme god of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth (Jastrow, 296, 300, 301). The books of the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>, though they depict a <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> system, represent the good god, <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Mazdah Ahura</a>, with his court, as helping those who worship him against the principle of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (Hist. of Relig., II, 14). In the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> theories, on the other hand, the world is shut off from the supreme god, Bythos, who has nothing directly to do with human affairs before or after the incarnation. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a remote and transcendent deity was probably derived from Greek philosophy. <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> certainly admitted Providence, and believed in inspiration and divination; but for <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Providence was mere opinion. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the world was for him the instrument and expression of the Divine thought, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself lived a life wholly apart. The <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> explicitly denied Providence, on the ground that if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cares for men He can be neither <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> nor good. Everything is due, they said, to chance or <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. On both these points they were opposed by the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who insisted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> men, otherwise the very notion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be destroyed (Plutarch, "De comm. notit.", 32; "De stoic. rep.", 38). They also attempted to prove the action or existence of Providence from the adaptation of means to ends in nature, in which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is merely an accident, a detail, or a punishment. On the other hand, the notions of God, nature, force, and fate were not clearly distinguished by the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who regarded them as practically the same thing. While even Cicero, who works out the argument from adaptation at considerable length in his "De natura deorum", ends unsatisfactorily with the statement, "Magna Dii curant, parva negligunt", as his ultimate solution of the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (n. 51-66).


<h2>The testimony of Scripture</h2>

<p>Though the term Providence is applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only three times in Scripture (<a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#vrs5">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a>; <a href="../bible/wis014.htm#vrs3">Wisdom 14:3</a>; <a href="../bible/jth009.htm#vrs5">Judith 9:5</a>), and once to Wisdom (<a href="../bible/wis006.htm#vrs17">Wisdom 6:17</a>), the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Providence is consistently taught throughout both the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not only implants in the nature of things the potentiality of future development (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs7">Genesis 1:7, 12, 22, 28</a>; <a href="../bible/gen008.htm#vrs17">8:17</a>; <a href="../bible/gen009.htm#vrs1">9:1, 7</a>; <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#vrs2">12:2</a>; <a href="../bible/gen015.htm#vrs5">15:5</a>), but in this development, as in all the operations of nature, He co-operates; so that in Scriptural language what nature does, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to do (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs5">Genesis 2:5</a>, cf. 9; <a href="../bible/gen007.htm#vrs4">7:4</a>, cf. 10; <a href="../bible/gen007.htm#vrs19">7:19-22</a>, cf. 23; <a href="../bible/gen008.htm#vrs1">8:1-2</a>, cf. 5 sq.). Seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, the clouds and the rain, the fruits of the earth, life itself alike are His gift (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs7">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="../bible/gen008.htm#vrs2">8:2</a>; <a href="../bible/psa146.htm#vrs8">Psalm 146:8, 9</a>; <a href="../bible/psa028.htm">28</a>; <a href="../bible/psa103.htm">103</a>; <a href="../bible/psa148.htm">148</a>; <a href="../bible/job038.htm#vrs37">Job 38:37</a>; <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#vrs21">Joel 2:21 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/sir011.htm#vrs14">Sirach 11:14</a>). So too with man. Man tills the ground (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs17">Genesis 3:17 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs12">4:12</a>; <a href="../bible/gen009.htm#vrs20">9:20</a>), but human labours without Divine assistance are of no avail (<a href="../bible/psa126.htm#vrs1">Psalm 126:1</a>; <a href="../bible/psa059.htm#vrs13">59:13</a>; <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#vrs31">Proverbs 21:31</a>). Even for an act of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, Divine concurrence is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hence in Scripture the expressions "God hardened <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> heart" (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs3">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="../bible/exo009.htm#vrs12">9:12</a>; <a href="../bible/exo010.htm#vrs1">10:1, 20, 27</a>; <a href="../bible/exo011.htm#vrs10">11:10</a>; <a href="../bible/exo014.htm#vrs8">14:8</a>), "Pharao's heart was hardened" (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs13">Exodus 7:13</a>; <a href="../bible/exo008.htm#vrs19">8:19, 32</a>; <a href="../bible/exo009.htm#vrs7">9:7, 35</a>), "Pharao hardened his heart" (viii, 15) and "Pharao did not set his heart to do it" (vii, 23), or "hearkened not" (vii, 4; viii, 19), or "increased his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (ix, 34), are practically synonymous. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the sole ruler of the world (<a href="../bible/job034.htm#vrs13">Job 34:13</a>). His will governs all things (<a href="../bible/psa148.htm#vrs8">Psalm 148:8</a>; <a href="../bible/job009.htm#vrs7">Job 9:7</a>; <a href="../bible/isa040.htm#vrs22">Isaiah 40:22-6</a>; <a href="../bible/isa044.htm#vrs24">44:24-8</a>; <a href="../bible/sir016.htm#vrs18">Sirach 16:18-27</a>; <a href="../bible/est013.htm#vrs9">Esther 13:9</a>). He loves all men (<a href="../bible/wis011.htm#vrs25">Wisdom 11:25, 27</a>), desires the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all (<a href="../bible/isa045.htm#vrs22">Isaiah 45:22</a>; <a href="../bible/wis012.htm#vrs16">Wisdom 12:16</a>), and His providence extends to all nations (<a href="../bible/deu002.htm#vrs19">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>; <a href="../bible/wis006.htm#vrs8">Wisdom 6:8</a>; <a href="../bible/isa066.htm#vrs18">Isaiah 66:18</a>). He desires not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should repent (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#vrs20">Ezekiel 18:20-32</a>; <a href="../bible/eze033.htm#vrs11">33:11</a>; <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#vrs24">Wisdom 11:24</a>); for He is above all things a merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of much compassion (<a href="../bible/exo034.htm#vrs6">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="../bible/num014.htm#vrs18">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#vrs10">Deuteronomy 5:10</a>; <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs5">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="../bible/psa102.htm#vrs8">102:8-17</a>; <a href="../bible/psa144.htm#vrs9">144:9</a>; <a href="../bible/sir002.htm#vrs23">Sirach 2:23</a>). Yet He is a just <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as well as a Saviour (<a href="../bible/isa045.htm#vrs21">Isaiah 45:21</a>). Hence both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> proceed from Him (<a href="../bible/lam003.htm#vrs38">Lamentations 3:38</a>; <a href="../bible/amo003.htm#vrs6">Amos 3:6</a>; <a href="../bible/isa045.htm#vrs7">Isaiah 45:7</a>; <a href="../bible/ecc007.htm">Ecclesiastes 7</a>; <a href="../bible/ecc015.htm">15</a>; <a href="../bible/sir011.htm#vrs14">Sirach 11:14</a>), good as a bounteous gift freely bestowed (<a href="../bible/psa144.htm#vrs16">Psalm 144:16</a>; <a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#vrs18">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#vrs12">1 Chronicles 29:12-4</a>), <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/lam003.htm#vrs39">Lamentations 3:39</a>; <a href="../bible/joe002.htm#vrs20">Joel 2:20</a>; <a href="../bible/amo003.htm#vrs10">Amos 3:10, 11</a>; <a href="../bible/isa005.htm#vrs4">Isaiah 5:4, 5</a>). For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewards men according to their works (<a href="../bible/lam003.htm#vrs64">Lamentations 3:64</a>; <a href="../bible/job034.htm#vrs10">Job 34:10-7</a>; <a href="../bible/psa017.htm#vrs27">Psalm 17:27</a>; <a href="../bible/sir016.htm#vrs12">Sirach 16:12, 13</a>; <a href="../bible/sir011.htm#vrs28">11:28</a>; <a href="../bible/1sa026.htm#vrs23">1 Samuel 26:23</a>), their thoughts, and their devices (<a href="../bible/jer017.htm#vrs10">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; <a href="../bible/jer032.htm#vrs19">32:19</a>; <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#vrs10">Psalm 7:10</a>). From His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> there is no escape (<a href="../bible/job009.htm#vrs13">Job 9:13</a>; <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs16">Psalm 32:16, 17</a>; <a href="../bible/wis016.htm#vrs13">Wisdom 16:13-8</a>); and none can prevail against Him (<a href="../bible/sir018.htm#vrs1">Sirach 18:1</a>; <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#vrs22">Wisdom 11:22-3</a>; <a href="../bible/pro021.htm#vrs30">Proverbs 21:30</a>; <a href="../bible/psa002.htm#vrs1">Psalm 2:1-4</a>; <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs10">32:10</a>; <a href="../bible/jth016.htm#vrs16">Judith 16:16, 17</a>). If the wicked are spared for a time (<a href="../bible/jer012.htm#vrs1">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="../bible/job021.htm#vrs7">Job 21:7-15</a>; <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#vrs12">Psalm 72:12-3</a>; <a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#vrs12">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>), they will ultimately receive their <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> if they do not repent (<a href="../bible/jer012.htm#vrs13">Jeremiah 12:13-7</a>; <a href="../bible/job021.htm#vrs17">Job 21:17, 18</a>; <a href="../bible/job027.htm#vrs13">27:13-23</a>); while the good, though they may suffer for a time, are comforted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/psa090.htm#vrs15">Psalm 90:15</a>; <a href="../bible/isa051.htm#vrs12">Isaiah 51:12</a>), who will build them up, and will not cease to do them good (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#vrs28">Jeremiah 31:28 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/jer032.htm#vrs41">32:41</a>). For in spite of the wicked, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> counsels are never changed or thwarted (<a href="../bible/isa014.htm#vrs24">Isaiah 14:24-7</a>; <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#vrs13">43:13</a>; <a href="../bible/isa046.htm#vrs10">46:10</a>; <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs11">Psalm 32:11</a>; <a href="../bible/psa148.htm#vrs6">148:6</a>). Evil He converts into good (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs20">Genesis 1:20</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/psa090.htm#vrs10">Psalm 90:10</a>); and suffering He uses as an instrument whereby to train men up as a father traineth up his children (<a href="../bible/deu008.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 8:1-6</a>; <a href="../bible/psa065.htm#vrs10">Psalm 65:10-2</a>; Wisdom 12:1, 2); so that in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the world fighteth for the just (<a href="../bible/wis016.htm#vrs17">Wisdom 16:17</a>).

<p>The teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> on Providence is assumed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, who draws therefrom practical lessons both in regard to confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs25">Matthew 6:25-33</a>; <a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs7">7:7-11</a>; <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs28">10:28-31</a>; <a href="../bible/mar011.htm#vrs22">Mark 11:22-4</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs9">Luke 11:9-13</a>; <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs26">John 16:26, 27</a>) and in regard to the forgiveness of our enemies (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs39">Matthew 5:39-45</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs27">Luke 6:27-38</a>); while in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> it becomes the basis of a definite and systematic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. To the Athenians in the Areopagus Paul declares: <ul> <li>that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and is its supreme Lord (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs24">Acts 17:24</a>); <li>that He sustains the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> in its existence, giving life and breath to all things (verse 25), and hence, as the source whence they all proceed, must Himself lack nothing nor stand in need of any human service; <li>that He has directed the growth of nations and their distribution (verse 26), and <li>this to the end that they should seek Him (verse 27) in Whom we live and move and have our being, and whose offspring we are (verse 28). </ul> Being therefore the offspring of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is absurd for us to liken Him to things inanimate (verse 29), and though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has borne with this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on man's part for a time, now He demands penance (verse 30), and, having sent Christ, Whose authority is guaranteed by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, has appointed a day when the world shall be judged by Him in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (verse 31). In the Epistle to the Romans the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of Divine Providence is further evolved, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Providence becomes identical with that of grace. Nature manifests so clearly the power and the divinity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that failure to recognize it is inexcusable (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs20">Romans 1:20-2</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> (verse 18) gives man over to the desires of his heart (verse 24), to a reprobate sense (verse 28). Some day He will vindicate Himself (ii, 2-5), rendering to every man according to his works (2:6-8; cf. <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs8">Galatians 6:8</a>), his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs9">Romans 2:9 sq.</a>), and his secret thoughts (ii, 16); but for the present He forbears (3:26; cf. 9:22; <a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs9">2 Peter 2:9</a>) and is ready to justify all men freely through the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs22">Romans 3:22, 24, 25</a>); for all men stand in need of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help (iii, 23). <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, moreover, having already received the grace of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> (v, 1), should glory in tribulation, knowing that it is but a trial which strengtheneth patience and hope (v, 3, 4). For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> that are to come are far greater than those already received (v, 10 sq.) and far more abundant than the consequences of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (v, 17). Life everlasting is promised to us (v, 21); but unaided we can do nothing to gain it (vii, 18-24). It is the grace of Christ that delivers us (vii, 25) and makes us co-heirs with Him (viii, 17). Yet we must also suffer with Him (verse 17) and be patient (verse 25), knowing that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Providence has regarded us with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> us to be made conformable to the image of His Son, that He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of many brethren, has called us (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>), has justified us (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs1">Romans 5:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>), and even now has begun to accomplish within us the work of glorification (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs29">Romans 8:29, 30</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs3">Ephesians 1:3 sq.</a>, <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). This, the beneficent purpose of an all-seeing Providence, is wholly gratuitous, entirely unmerited (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs24">Romans 3:24</a>; 9:11-2). It extends to all men (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs10">Romans 2:10</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 2:4</a>), even to the reprobate <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs26">Romans 11:26 sq.</a>); and by it all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dealings with man are regulated (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs11">Ephesians 1:11</a>).
<h2>The testimony of the Fathers</h2>

<p>The Testimony of the Fathers is, it need hardly be said, perfectly unanimous from the very outset. Even those Fathers &#151; and they are not many &#151; who do not treat expressly of the subject use the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Providence as the basis of their teaching, both dogmatic and practical (e.g. Clement, "I Epis. ad Cor.", xix sq., xxvii, xxviii in "P.G.", I, 247-54, 267-70). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> governs the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> [Aristides, "Apol.", I, xv in "Texts and Studies" (1891), 35, 50; "Anon. epis. ad Diog.", vii in "P.G.", II, 1175 sq.; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04164.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> IV.75</a>; <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> "Lib de idol. van.", viii, ix in "P.L.", IV, 596-7; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Ad eos qui scandalizati sunt", V in "P.G.", LII, 487; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "De gen. ad lit.", V, xxi, n. 42 in "P.L.", XXXIV, 335-8; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, "Lib. moral.", XXXII, n. 7 in "P.L.", LXXVI, 637 sq.; XVI, xii in "P.L.", lxxv, 1126]. It extends to every individual, adapting itself to the needs of each (<a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Hom. xxviii in Matt.", n. 3 in "P.G.", LVII, 354), and embraces even what we think is due to our own initiative (Hom. xxi, n. 3 in "P.G.", 298). All things are created and governed with a view to man, to the development of his life and his intelligence, and to the satisfaction of his needs (Aristides, "Apol.", i, v, vi, xv, xvi; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04164.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> IV.74</a> and <a href="../fathers/04164.htm">IV.78</a>; Lactantius, "De ira Dei", xiii, xv in "P.L.", VII, 115 sq.; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Hom. xiii in Matt.", n. 5 in "P.G.", LVII, 216, 217; "Ad eos qui scand.", vii, viii in "P.G.", LII, 491-8; "Ad Stagir.", I, iv in "P.G.", XLVII, 432-4; St. Augustine, "De div. qu&aelig;st.", xxx, xxxi in "P.L.", XL, 19, 20). The chief <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is derived from the adaptation of means to an end, which, since it takes place in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> comprising a vast multitude of relatively independent <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> differing in nature, function, and end, implies the continuous control and unifying governance of a single supreme Being (<a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, "Octavius", xvii in Halm, "Corp. Scrip. Eccl. Lat.", II, 21, 22; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Marcion.", II, iii, iv in "P.L.", II, 313-5; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04164.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> IV.74 sq.</a>; Lactantius, "De ira Dei", x-xv in "P.L.", VII, 100 sq.; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Hom. ad Pop. Ant.", ix, 3, 4 in "P.G.", XLIX, 106-9; "Ad eos. qui seand.", v, vii, viii in "P.G.", LII, 488-98; "In Ps.", v, n. 9 in "P.G.", LV, 54-6; "Ad Demetrium", ii, 5 in "P.G.", XLVII, 418, 419; "Ad Stagir.", passim in "P.G.", XLVII, 423 sq.; St. Augustine, "De gen. ad lit.", V, xx-xxiii in "P.L.", XXXIV, 335 sq.; "In Ps.", cxlviii, n. 9-15 in "P.L.", XXXVII, 1942-7; Theodoret, "De prov. orat.", i-v in "P.G.", LXXXIII, 555 sq.; <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, "De fid. orth.", i, 3 in "P.G.", XCIV, 795 sq.). Again, from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, it shows that He must also govern it; for just as the contrivances of man demand attention and guidance, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a good workman, must care for His work (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, "De Offic. minist.", XIII in "P.L.", XVI, 41; St. Augustine, "In Ps.", cxlv, n. 12, 13 in "P.L.", XXXVII, 1892-3; Theodoret, "Deprov. orat.", i, ii in "P.G.", LXXXIII, 564, 581-4; Salvianus, "De gub. Dei", I, viii-xii in "P.L.", LIII, 40 sq.; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, "Lib. moral.", xxiv, n. 46 in "P.L.", LXXVI, 314). In addition to this, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> ("De testim. anim&aelig;" in "P.L.", I, 681 sq.) and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (loc. cit.) appeal to the testimony of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as expressed in sayings common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> (cf. Salvianus, loc. cit.); while Lactantius ("De ira Dei", viii, xii, xvi in "P.L.", VII, 97, 114, 115, 126) uses a distinctly pragmatic argument based on the utter ruin that would result to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, were the Providence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> generally denied.

<p>The question of Providence in the Fathers is almost invariably connected with the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. How can <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and suffering be compatible with the beneficent providence of an all-powerful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? And why especially should the just be allowed to suffer while the wicked are apparently prosperous and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? Patristic solutions to these problems may be summed up under the following heads: <ul> <li>Sin is not <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it happens with His permission. It can be ascribed to Providence only as a secondary result (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04164.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> IV.68</a>; <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, "De fid. orth.", ii, 21 in "P.G.", XCIV, 95 sq.). <li>Sin is due to the abuse of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; an abuse which was certainly foreseen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but could have been prevented only by depriving man of his most noble attribute (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Marcion.", II, v-vii in "P.L.", II, 317-20; <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> "In Julian.", IX, xiii, 10, 11, 18 in "P.G.", LXXIV, 120-1, 127-32; Theodoret, "De prov. orat.", IX, vi in "P.G.", LXXXIII, 662). <li>Moreover, in this world man has to learn by experience and contrast, and to develop by the overcoming of obstacles (Lactantius, "De ira Dei", xiii, xv in "P.L.", VII, 115-24; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "De ordine", I, vii, n. 18 in "P.L.", XXXII, 986). <li>One reason therefore why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is that man may arrive at once at a consciousness of righteousness and of his own inability to attain it, and so may put his trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Anon. epis. ad Diog., vii-ix in "P.G.", II, 1175 sq.; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, "Lib. moral.", III, lvii in "P.L.", LXXV, 627). <li>For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not responsible, but only for the evils that result as a punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Marc.", II, xiv, xv in "P.L.", II, 327 sq.), evils which happen without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will but are not contrary to it (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, op. cit., VI, xxxii in "P.L.", LXXVII, 746, 747). <li>Had there been no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would have been inconsistent with the Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> (St. Augustine, "De div. qu&aelig;st.", lxxxii in "P.L.", LX, 98, 99); nor would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at all, unless He could draw good out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (St. Augustine, "Enchir.", xi in "P.L.", LX, 236; "Serm.", ccxiv, 3 in "P.L.", XXXVIII, 1067; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, op. cit., VI, xxxii, XVIII, xlvi in "P.L.", LXXV, 747; LXXVI, 61-2). <li>All physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, therefore, is the consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the inevitable result of the Fall (<a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Ad Stagir.", I, ii in "P.G.", LXVII, 428, 429; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, op. cit., VIII, li, lii in "P.L.", LXXV, 833, 834), and regarded in this light is seen to be at once a medicine (St. Augustine, "De div. qu&aelig;st.", lxxxii in "P.L.", XL, 98, 99; "Serm.", xvii, 4, 5 in "P.L.", XXXVIII, 126-8), a discipline ("Serm.", xv, 4-9 in "P.L.", XXXVIII, 118-21; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, op. cit., V, xxxv; VII, xxix; XIV, xl in "P.L.", LXXV, 698, 818, 1060), and an occasion of charity (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, VII, xxix). Evil and suffering thus tend to the increase of merit (XIV, xxxvi, xxxvii in "P.L.", 1058, 1059), and in this way the function of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> becomes an agency for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, c. "Adv. Marc.", II, xi, xiii in "P.L.", 324 sq.). <li>Evil, therefore, <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> design (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, op. cit., VI, xxxii in "P.L.", LXXV, 747; Theodoret, "De prov. orat.", v-viii in "P.L.", LXXXIII, 652 sq.). Hence, if the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> be considered as a whole it will be found that that which for the individual is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will in the end turn out to be consistent with Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, in conformity with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and right order (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04164.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> IV.99</a>; St. Augustine, "De ordine", I, i-v, 9; II, iv in "P.L.", XXXII, 977-87, 990, 999-1002). <li>It is the end that proves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> (Lactantius, "De ira Dei", xx in "P.L.", VII, 137 sq.; St. Ambrose, "De offic. minist.", XVI, cf. XII, XV in "P.L.", XVI, 44-6, 38 sq.; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Hom. xiii in Matt.", n. 5 in "P.G.", LXVII, 216, 217; St. Augustine "In Ps.", xci, n. 8 in "P.L.", XXXIII, 1176; Theodoret, "De prov. orat.", ix in "P.G.", LXXXIII, 727 sq.). In the Last Judgment the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will be solved, but till then the workings of Providence will remain more or less a mystery (St. Augustine, "De div. qu&aelig;st.", lxxxii in "P.L.", XL, 98, 99; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "Ad eos qui scand.", VIII, IX in "P.G.", LII, 494, 495). In regard to poverty and suffering, however, it is well to bear in mind that in depriving us of earthly goods, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is but recalling what is His own (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, op. cit., II, xxxi in "P.L.", LXXVII, 571); and secondly that, as Salvianus tells us ("De gub. Dei", I, i, 2 in "P.L.", LIII, 29 sq.), nothing is so light that it does not appear heavy to him who bears it unwillingly, and nothing so heavy that it does not appear light to him who bears it with goodwill. </ul>
<h2>The testimony of the councils</h2>

<p>From the creeds we learn that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> creator of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth; that <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, became man, suffered and died for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and is to be the judge of the living and the dead; that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> inspired the Prophets and the Apostles, and dwells in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> &#151; all of which implies Providence, natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. The Profession of Faith prescribed for the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> in 1208 declares <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the governor and disposer of all things corporeal and spiritual (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 10th ed., 1908, n. 421). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. vi, A.D. 816) defines that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in the power of man, and that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds are not to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the same sense as good deeds, but <em>permissive</em> only, so that the vocation of Paul is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work in a much truer sense than the treachery of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>. The Council of the Vatican sums up past <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the statement that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His Providence protects and governs all things (Sess. III, c. I, d. 1784).
<h2>Philosophical developments</h2>

<p>The basis of all further <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculations among <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> in regard to the precise nature of Providence, its relation to other <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, and of creation, was laid by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> in the "De consol. phil." (IV, vi sq. in "P.L.", LXIII, 813 sq.). Providence is the Divine Intelligence itself as it exists in the supreme principle of all things and disposes all things; or, again, it is the evolution of things temporal as conceived and brought to unity in the Divine Intelligence, which, as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> says (Summa I, G. xxii, a. 1), is the cause of all things. Providence, therefore, pertains primarily to the Intelligence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it implies also will (I, Q. xxii, a. 1, ad 3 urn), and hence is defined by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> as "the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by which all things are ruled according to right <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>" ("De fid. orth.", i, 3 in "P.G.", XCIV, 963, 964). The term "Providence", however, must not be taken too literally. It is not merely sight, or fore-sight. It involves more than mere vision or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for it implies the active disposition and arrangement of things with a view to a definite end; but it does not involve succession. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> beholds all things together in one comprehensive act (I, Q. xxii, a. 3, ad 3 um), and by the same act produces, conserves, and concurs in all things (I, Q. civ a. 1, ad 4 urn). Providence as expressed in the created order of things is by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> called Fate (loc. cit.); but St. Thomas naturally objects to the use of this term (I, Q. cxvi, a. 1). Strictly only those things which are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the production of certain determinate effects are subject to necessity or Fate (I, Q. xxii, a. 4; Q. cii, a. 3; Q. cxvi, a. 1, 2, 4). This excludes chance, which is a relative term and implies merely that some things happen irrespective of, or even contrary to, the natural purpose and tendency of some particular agent, natural or free (I, Q. xxii, a. 2; Q. cvi, a. 7; Q. cxvi, a. 1); not that things happen irrespective of the supreme and universal cause of all things. But it does not exclude <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Some causes are not determined <em>ad unum</em>, but are free to choose between the effects which they are capable of producing (I, Q. xxii, a. 2 ad 4 um; cf. <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, op. cit., V, ii, in "P.L.", LXIII, 835). Thus things happen contingently as well as of necessity (I, Q. xxii, a. 4), for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given to different things different ways of acting, and His concurrence is given accordingly (I, Q. xxii, a. 4). Yet all things, whether due to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> causes or to the free choice of man, are foreseen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and preordained in accordance with His all-embracing purpose. Hence Providence is at once universal, immediate, efficacious, and without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>: universal, because all things are subject to it (I, Q. xxii, a. 2; ciii, a. 5); immediate, in that though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts through secondary causes, yet all alike postulate Divine concurrence and receive their powers of operation from Him (I, Q. xxii, a. 3; Q. ciii, a. 6); efficacious, in that all things minister to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> final purpose, a purpose which cannot be frustrated (Contra Gent., III, xciv); without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> (suavis), because it violates no <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, but rather effects its purpose through these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (I, Q. ciii, a. 8).

<p>The functions of Providence are threefold. As physical, it conserves what is and concurs with what acts or becomes; as moral, it bestows upon man the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, sanctions &#151; physical, moral, and social &#151; answers human <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and in general governs both the nation and the individual. That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should answer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> must not be understood as a violation of the order of natural Providence, but rather as the carrying of Providence into effect, "because this very arrangement that such a concession be made to such a petitioner, falls under the order of Divine Providence. Therefore to say that we should not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to gain anything of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the order of His Providence is unchangeable, is like saying that we should not walk to get to a place, or eat to support life" (Contra Gent., III, xcv). The Providence whereby we are enabled to overcome <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and to merit eternal life &#151; <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Providence &#151; pertains to another order, and for a discussion of it the reader is referred to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>; <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">PREDESTINATION</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas'</a> treatment of the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in relation to Providence is based upon the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as a whole. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills that His nature should be manifested in the highest possible way, and hence has created things like to Himself not only in that they are good in <em>se</em>, but also in that they are the cause of good in others (I, Q. ciii, a. 4, 6). In other words He has created a <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, not a number of isolated beings. Whence it follows, according to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, that natural operations tend to what is better for the whole, but not necessarily what is better for each part except in relation to the whole (I, Q. xxii, a. 2, ad 2 um; Q. lviii, a. 2, ad 3 um; Contra Gent., III, xciv). Sin and suffering are evils because they are contrary to the good of the individual and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> original purpose in regard to the individual, but they are not contrary to the good of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and this good will ultimately be realized by the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> Providence of God.
