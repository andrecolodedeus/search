<h1>Docetae</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Doketai</em>.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> dating back to Apostolic times. Their name is derived from <em>dokesis</em>, "appearance" or "semblance", because they taught that Christ only "appeared" or "seemed to be a man, to have been born, to have lived and suffered. Some denied the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> altogether, some only the reality of His human body or of His birth or death. The word <em>Docetae</em> which is best rendered by "Illusionists", first occurs in a letter of Serapion, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (190-203) to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Rhossos, where troubles had arisen about the public reading of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Gospel of Peter. Serapion at first unsuspectingly allowed but soon after forbade, this, saying that he had borrowed a copy from the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> who used it, "whom we call Docetae". He suspected a connection with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionism</a> and found in this Gospel "some additions to the right teaching of the Saviour". A fragment of apocryphon was discovered in 1886 and contained three passages which savoured strongly of Illusionism. The name further occurs in <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (d. 216), <a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.13</a> and <a href="../fathers/02107.htm">VII.17</a>, where these sectaries are mentioned together with the Haematites as instances of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> being named after their own special <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> itself, however, is much older, as it is combated in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Clement mentions a certain Julius Cassianus as <em>ho tes dokeseos exarchon</em>, "the founder of Illusionism". This name is known also to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and Theodoret; and Cassianus is said to be a disciple of Valentinian, but nothing more is known of him. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the unreality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was held by the oldest <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and can not therefore have originated with Cassianus. As Clement distinguished the Docetae from other <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, he problably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> some sectaries the sum-total of whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> consisted in this illusion theory; but Docetism, as far as at present known, as always an accompaniment of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> or later of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>. The Docetae described by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (Philos., VIII, i-iv, X, xii) are likewise a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; these perhaps extended their illusion theory to all material substances.

<p>Docetism is not properly a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">Christian heresy</a> at all, as it did not arise in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the misunderstanding of a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but rather came from without. <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> starting from the principle of antagonism between matter and spirit, and making all <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consist in becoming free from the bondage of matter and returning as pure spirit to the Supreme Spirit, could not possibly accept the sentence, "the Word was made flesh", in a literal sense. In order to borrow from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a Saviour who was <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the Good God</a>, they were forced to modify the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Incarnation. Their embarrassment with this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> caused many vaccinations and inconsistencies; some holding the indwelling of an Aeon in a body which was indeed real body or humanity at all; others denying the actual objective existence of any body or humanity at all; others allowing a "psychic", but not a "hylic" or really material body; others <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in a real, yet not human "sidereal" body; others again accepting the of the body but not the reality of the birth from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or the reality of the passion and death on the cross. Christ only seemed to suffer, either because He ingeniously and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> substituted someone else to bear the pain, or because the occurence on Calvary was a visual deception. <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> first spoke of a "putative passion of Christ and blasphemously asserted that it was really he, Simon himself, who underwent these apparent sufferings. "As the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> governed this world badly because each <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> coveted the principality for himself he [Simon] came to improve matters, and was transfigured and rendered like unto the Virtues and Powers and Angels, so that he appeared amongst men as man though he was no man and was believed to have suffered in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> though he had not suffered" (<em>passum in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> putatum cum non esset passus</em> &#151; <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Adv. Haer. I, xxiii sqq.). The mention of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurgic</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stamps this passage as a piece of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. Soon after a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> of Antioch, Saturninus or Saturnilus (about 125) made Christ the chief of the Aeons, but tried to show that the Savior was unborn (<em>agenneton</em>) and without body (<em>asomaton</em>) and without form (<em>aneideon</em>) and only apparently (<em>phantasia</em>) seen as man (Irenaeus, Adv. Haer., XXIV, ii).

<p>Another Syrian <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, Cerdo, who came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Pope Hyginus (137) and became the master of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, taught that "Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the Highest God</a>, appeared without birth from the Virgin, yea without any birth on earth as man". All this is natural enough, for matter not being the creation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Highest God</a> but of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, Christ could have none of it. This is clearly brought out by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in his polemic against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. According to this heresiarch (140) Christ, without passing through the womb of Mary and endowed with only a putative body, suddenly came from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to Capharnaum in the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> remarks: "All these tricks about a putative corporeality <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> has adopted lest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth should be argued from the reality of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and thus Christ should be vindicated as the work of the Creator [<a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>] and be shown to have human flesh even as he had human birth" (Adv. Marc., III, xi). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> further states that <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> chief disciple, <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, slightly modified his master's system, accepting indeed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, but strenuously denying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His birth. He contended that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had an astral body made of superior substance, and he compared the Incarnation to the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to Abraham. This, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> sarcastically remarks, is getting from the frying pan into fire, <em>de calcari&acirc; in carbonariam</em>. Valentinus the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> attempted to accommodate his system still more closely to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> by admitting not merely the reality of the Saviour's body but even a seeming birth, saying that the Saviour's body passed through Mary as through a channel (<em>hos dia solenos</em>) though he took nothing from her, but had a body from above. This approximation to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, however, was only apparent, for Valentinus distinguished between Christ and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Christ and the Holy Ghost were emanations from the Aeons together proceeded <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the Saviour, who became united with the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>.



<p>In the East, Marinus and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>, though not <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a> himself, held similar views with regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> astral body and seeming birth. In the West, Ptolemy reduced Docetism to a minimum by saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was indeed a real man, but His substance was a compound of the pneumatic and the psychic (spiritual and ethereal). The pneumatic He received from Achamoth or Wisdom, the psychic from the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, His psychic nature enabled him to suffer and feel pain, though He possessed nothing grossly material. (Irenaeus, Adv. Haer., I, xii, II, iv). As the Docetae objected to the reality of the birth, so from the first they particularly objected to the reality of the passion. Hence the clumsy attempts at substitution of another victim by <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and others. According to <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, Christ seemed to men to be a man and to have performed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. It was not, however, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who suffered but Simon of Cyrenes who was constrained to carry the cross and was mistakenly crucified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> stead. Simon having received <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> form, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> returned Simon's and thus stood by and laughed. Simon was crucified and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> returned to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (Irenaeus, Adv. Char., 1, xxiv). According to some apocrypha it was <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, not Simon the Cyrenean, who was thus substituted. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> describes a <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> who took the name of Docetae, though for what reason is not apparent, especially as their semblance theory was the least pronounced feature in their system. Their views were in close affinity to those of the Valentians. The primal Being is, so to speak, the seed of a fig-tree, small in size but <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in power; from it proceed three Aeons, tree, leaves, fruit, which, multiplied with the perfect number ten, become thirty. These thirty Aeons together fructify one of themselves, from whom proceeds the Virgin-Saviour, a perfect representation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Highest God</a>. The Saviour's task is to hinder further transference of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from body to body, which is the work of the Great Archon, the Creator of the world. The Saviour enters the world unnoticed, unknown, obscure. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced the glad tidings to Mary. He was born and did all the things that are written of him in the Gospels. But in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he received the figure and seal of another body besides that born of the Virgin. The object of this was that when the Archon condemned his own peculiar figment of flesh to the death of the cross, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>--that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which had been nourished in the body born of the Virgin--might strip off that body and nail it to the accursed tree. In the pneumatic body received at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could triumph over the Archon, whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intent he had eluded.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which destroyed the very meaning and purpose of the Incarnation, was combated even by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Possibly <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> statement that in Christ dwelt the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> <em>corporaliter</em> (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs19">Colossians 1:19, 2:9</a>) has some reference to Docetic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> St. John (<a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#vrs1">1 John 1:1-3</a>, <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs1">4:1-3</a>; <a href="../bible/2jo000.htm#vrs7">2 John 7</a>) refers to this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; so at least it seemed to <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.25</a>) and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De carne Christi, xxiv). In sub-Apostolic times this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was vigorously combated by St. Ignatius and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. The former made a warning against Docetists the burden of his letters; he speaks of them as "monsters in human shape" (<em>therion anthropomorphon</em>) and bids the faithful not only not to receive them but even to avoid meeting them. Pathetically he exclaims: If, as some godless men [<em>atheoi</em>], I mean unbelievers, say, He has suffered only in outward appearance, they themselves are nought but outward show. why am I in bonds? Why should I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to fight with wild beasts? Then I die for nothing, then I would only be lying against the Lord" (<a href="../fathers/0106.htm"><em>Trallians</em> 10</a>; <a href="../fathers/0104.htm"><em>Ephesians</em> 7 and 18</a>; <a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 1-6</a>). In St. Ignatius' day Docetism seems to have been closely connected with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> (cf. <a href="../fathers/0105.htm"><em>Magnesians</em> 8.1 and 10.3</a>; <a href="../fathers/0108.htm"><em>Philadelphians</em> 6 and 8</a>). <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> in his letter to the Philippians re-echoes <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm">1 John 4:2-4</a>; to the same purpose. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> nowhere expressly combats Docetic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but he mentions several <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> who were <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for their Docetic aberrations, as Basilideans and Valentinians, and in his "Dialogue with Trypho the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>" he strongly emphasizes the birth of Christ from the Virgin. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> wrote a treatise "On the flesh of Christ" and attacked Docetic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in his "Adversus Marcionem". <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> in his "Philosophoumena" refutes Docetism in the different <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which he enumerates and twice gives the Docetic system as above referred to.

<p>The earlier Docetism seemed destined to die with the death of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, when it received a long lease of life as parasitic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to another <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>. <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> started with a two-fold eternal principle, good (spirit) and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (matter). In order to add <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soteriology to Iranian <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, they were forced, as the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> were, to tamper with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Incarnation. <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a> distinguished between a <em>Jesus patibilis</em> and a <em>Jesus impatibilis</em> or Christ. The latter was the light as dwelling in, or symbolized by, or personified under, the name of the Sun; the former was the light as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in matter and darkness; of which light each human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was a spark. <em>Jesus patibilis</em> was therefore but a sign of the speech, an abstraction of the Good, the pure light above. In the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> Christ appears in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, Son of the Eternal Light and also <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; but in the latter expression "man" is a technical <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> term for the <em>Logos</em> or World-Soul; both <em>anthropos</em> and <em>pneuma</em> are emanations of the Deity. Though Christ is <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> He has only a seeming body, and only seemingly suffers, His passion being called mystical fiction of the cross. It is obvious that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> borrowed from that of the Incarnation nothing but a few names. Scattered instances of Docetism are found as far West as <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> among the Priscillianists of the fourth and the fifth century. The <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and the Selicians in Constantinople fostered these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> existed even in the tenth century, denying the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth and appealing to <a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7:20</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to them, sent an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to undergo the passion. Hence they worshipped not the cross but the Gospel, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> word. Among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> the Bogomilae renewed the ancient fancy that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> entered Mary's body by the right ear, and received from her but an apparent body. In the West a council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 1022 condemned thirteen Catharist <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> for denying the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life and death. In modern <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophic</a> and spiritist circles this early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is being renewed by <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> scarcely less fantastic than the wildest vagaries of old.
