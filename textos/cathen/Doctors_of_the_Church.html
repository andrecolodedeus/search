<h1>Doctors of the Church</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Doctores Ecclesiae</em>) &#151; Certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers have received this title on account of the great advantage the whole Church has derived from their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. In the Western church four eminent <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> attained this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>: <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. The "four Doctors" became a commonplace among the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (1298) ordering their feasts to be kept as doubles in the whole Church is contained in his sixth book of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (cap. "Gloriosus", de relique. et vener. sanctorum, in Sexto, III, 22).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> three Doctors were pre-eminent: <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>. The feasts of these three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> throughout the Eastern Empire by Leo VI, the Wise, the deposer of Photius. A common feast was later instituted in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on 30 January, called "the feast of the three Hierarchs". In the Menaea for that day it is related that the three Doctors appeared in a dream to John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Euchaitae, and commanded him to institute a festival in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in order to put a stop to the rivalries of their votaries and panegyrists. This was under Alexius Comnenus (1081-1118; see "Acta SS.", 14 June, under St. Basil, c. xxxviii). But sermons for the feast are attributed in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> to Cosmas Vestitor, who flourished in the tenth century. The three are as common in Eastern art as the four are in Western. Durandus (i, 3) remarks that Doctors should be represented with books in their hands. In the West analogy led to the veneration of four Eastern Doctors, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> being very properly added to the three hierarchs.

<p>To these great names others have subsequently been added. The requisite conditions are enumerated as three: <em>eminens doctrina, insignis vitae sanctitas, Ecclesiae declaratio</em> (i.e. eminent learning, a high degree of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and proclamation by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>). <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> explains the third as a declaration by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> or by a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. But though <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> have acclaimed the writings of certain Doctors, no council has actually conferred the title of Doctor of the Church. In practice the procedure consists in extending to the universal church the use of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> of a saint in which the title of doctor is applied to him. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is issued by the Congregation of Sacred Rites and approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, after a careful examination, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> writings. It is not in any way an <em>ex cathedra</em> decision, nor does it even amount to a declaration that no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is to be found in the teaching of the Doctor. It is, indeed, well known that the very greatest of them are not wholly immune from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. No <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> has ever been included in the list, since the Office and the Mass are for Confessors. Hence, as <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> points out, St. Ignatius, St. Iren&aelig;us, and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> are not called Doctors of the Church.

<p>The proper Mass of Doctors has the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> "In medio", borrowed from that of the <em>Theologus</em> par excellence, <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, together with special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and Gospel. The Credo is said. The principal peculiarity of the Office is the antiphon to the Magnificat at both <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, "O DOCTOR OPTIME", and it is rather by this antiphon than by the special mass that a saint is perceived to be a doctor (S.R.C., 7 Sept., 1754). In fact, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> has a Mass of his own, while <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Basil, Leo, and <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> have not the Gospel of Doctors, and several have not the collect.

<p>The feasts of the four Latin Doctors were not added to until the sixteenth century, when <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> was declared a Doctor by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> in his new edition of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (1568), in which the feasts of the four Greek Doctors were also raised to the rank of doubles. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (1588) added <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> was added by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1720), <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a> by <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a> (1722), <a href="../cathen/11762c.htm">St. Peter Chrysologus</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1729), <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a> (a well-deserved but belated <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>) by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1754), <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> (1828), and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> (1830). <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary</a> (1851) and to two more modern <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> (1871) and <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> (1877). <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> promoted (1883) the Easterns, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (1899).

<p><a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, when, in 1882, he introduced the simplification of double <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a>, made an exception for Doctors, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> are always to be transferred.

<div class="stiki">
<p><em>Web Editor's note:</em> Benedict XV added <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> (1920). Pius XI promoted <a href="../cathen/11756c.htm">St. Peter Canisius</a> (1925), <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a> (1926), <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">St. Robert Bellarmine</a> (1931), and <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">St. Albertus Magnus</a> (1931), Pius XII added <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> (1946). John XXIII named <a href="../cathen/09359a.htm">St. Lawrence of Brindisi</a> (1959), and in 1970 Paul VI added <a href="../cathen/14515b.htm">St. Teresa of Avila</a> and <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>. John Paul II added <a href="../cathen/17721a.htm">St. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of Lisieux</a> in 1997.</p>

<p>There are therefore now thirty-three Doctors of the Church, of whom eight are Eastern and twenty-four <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a>. They include three <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, three <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, three <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a>, and five <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. For some of these the Office had previously been granted to certain places or orders &#151; <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, St. Isidore to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and to all <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. <a href="../cathen/09102a.htm">St. Leander of Seville</a> and <a href="../cathen/06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a> are kept as Doctors in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the former by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> also, as he was in earlier times claimed as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. <a href="../cathen/07649b.htm">St. Ildephonsus</a> has the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> "In medio" in the same order (for the same reason) and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> without the rank of Doctor.</p></div>
