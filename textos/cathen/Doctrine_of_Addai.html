<h1>Doctrine of Addai</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Doctrina Addoei</em>).

<p>A Syriac document which relates the legend of the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. It begins with the story of the letter of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the reply of the latter, with some variations from the account drawn by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250101.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.13</a>) from the Edessene archives. The reply was not a letter, as <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says, but a verbal message, together with a portrait of Christ (not in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>). After the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> Judas Thomas sent Addai, one of the seventy-two disciples, to Abgar. Addai (Thaddeus in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>) healed the king of his sickness, and preached before him, relating the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> by Protonice, wife of the Emperor Claudius; this, with all that follows, is later than <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, being founded on the story of St. Helena. Addai then preaches to the people, who are converted. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> altars are thrown down, and the people are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. King Abgar induces the <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Emperor Tiberius</a> to chastise the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for having crucified the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. Churches are built by Addai, and he makes <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. On his death-bed he appoints Aggai his successor, ordains the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Palut <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and gives his last admonitions. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the sepulchre of the king's ancestors. Many years after his death, Aggai, who <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the country, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> as he taught in the church by a rebellious son of Abgar. His successor, Palut, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go to Antioch in order to get episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which he received from Serapion, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, who "himself also received the hand from <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of the city of Rome</a>, from the succession of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Simon Cephas, which he received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, who was there <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> twenty-five years, in the days of the C&aelig;sar, who reigned there thirteen years" (evidently <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> is meant, who reigned from October, 54, to June, 68). The anxiety of the writer to connect the Edessene succession with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is interesting; its derivation from the Petrine See of Antioch does not suffice him.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the book is not unorthodox, though some expressions might be understood in an <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> sense. The mention of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> must be noticed: "They read in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the New, and the Prophets, and the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, every day they meditated on them"; "a large number of people assembled day by day and came to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the service, and to [the reading] of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, of the Diatessaron"; "But the Law and the Prophets and the Gospel, which ye read every day before the people, and the Epistles of Paul, which Simon Peter sent us from the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the Acts of the twelve Apostles, which John, the son of Zebedee, sent us from Ephesus, these books read ye in the Churches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with these read not any others, as there is not any other in which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that ye hold is written, except these books, which retain you in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which ye have been called." The canon therefore excludes the Apocalypse and all the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>; in this it agrees with <a href="../cathen/01593c.htm">Aphraates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, the Syriac stichometrical list of Cod. Sin. 10 (in Mrs. Lewis's Catalogue of Sinai Manuscripts), and probably with <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">Ephrem</a>. The Syriac Church, indeed, never accepted the Apocalypse and the four shorter <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>; the three longer were admitted at all events later than 400, at an uncertain date. The Diatessaron was employed by the Syriac Church from its composition by <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> c. 160 until it was proscribed by the famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, Rabbula (d. 435).

<p>We seem to find firm historical ground in the statement that Palut was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Serapion, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> c. 191-212 and really a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Pope Zephyrinus</a>. But this shows that Addai, who made Palut a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was not one of the seventy-two Disciples of Christ. The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> was in reality Abgar IX (179-214) who was converted soon after 201, and this date tallies with that of Palut. It is possible that Palut was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; but it is surely more likely that there was already a Church and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> kings in so important a city. An early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> for the Abgar legend is sometimes based upon the promise in the message of Christ: "Thy city shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, and no enemy shall again become master of it forever." It is argued that this could not have been invented after the sacking of the city under <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> in 116; but the writer might have passed over this event after a century and a half. The confusion of dates can hardly have arisen before the latter half of the third century, and the Edessene Acts used by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> were probably not very old when he wrote. The " Doctrine of Addai" is yet later. The Finding of the Cross must be dated some time later than St. Helena; the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> picture of Christ was not seen by the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Etheria when she visited <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> c. 385. Hence the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the work may be c. 400.

<p>The " Doctrine of Addai" was first published in Syriac in a fragmentary form by Cureton, "Ancient Syriac documents" (London, 1864, a posthumous work), with a translation; another translation in "Ante-Nicene Chr. Libr.", XX. The full Syriac text was published by Phillips, with a translation (London, 1876). An <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version and (separately) a French translation, by the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarist</a> Father Leo Alishan, "Laboubnia, Lettre d'Abgar" (Venice, 1868).
