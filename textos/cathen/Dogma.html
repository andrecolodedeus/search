<h1>Dogma</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>The word <em>dogma</em> (Gr. <em>dogma</em> from <em>dokein</em>) signifies, in the writings of the ancient classical authors, sometimes, an opinion or that which seems <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; sometimes, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> doctrines or tenets, and especially the distinctive <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> doctrines, of a particular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> (cf. Cic. Ac., ii, 9), and sometimes, a public <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> or ordinance, as <em>dogma poieisthai</em>.

<p>In <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> it is used, at one time, in the sense of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> or edict of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, as in <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs1">Luke 2:1</a>: "And it came to pass, that in those days there went out a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> [edictum, <em>dogma</em>] from <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Caesar Augustus</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs7">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="../bible/est003.htm#vrs3">Esther 3:3</a>); at another time, in the sense of an ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> as in <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs15">Ephesians 2:15</a>: "Making void the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of commandments contained in decrees" (<em>dogmasin</em>), and again, it is applied to the ordinances or decrees of the first Apostolic Council in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: "And as they passed through the cities, they delivered unto them the decrees [<em>dogmata</em>] for to keep, that were decreed by the apostles and ancients who were at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs4">Acts 16:4</a>).

<p>Among the early Fathers the usage was prevalent of designating as dogmas the doctrines and moral <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> taught or <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the Saviour or by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>; and a distinction was sometimes made between Divine, Apostolical, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dogmas, according as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was conceived as having been taught by Christ, by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, or as having been delivered to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>But according to a long-standing usage a dogma is now understood to be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> appertaining to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, transmitted from the Apostles in the Scriptures or by tradition, and proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. It might be described briefly as a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <em>defined</em> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; but <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">private revelations</a> do not constitute dogmas, and some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> confine the word defined to doctrines solemnly defined by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or by a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, while a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> becomes a dogma even when proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through her ordinary magisterium or teaching office. A dogma therefore implies a twofold relation: to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> and to the authoritative teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h3>The three classes of revealed truths</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> distinguish three classes of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> <em>formally</em> and <em>explicitly</em> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a>; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <em>formally</em>, but only <em>implicitly</em>; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> only <em>virtually</em> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a>.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is said to be formally revealed, when the speaker or revealer really means to convey that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by his language, to guarantee it by the authority of his word. The <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is formal and explicit, when made in clear express terms. It is formal but only implicit, when the language is somewhat obscure, when the rules of interpretation must be carefully employed to determine the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. And a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> only virtually, when it is not formally guaranteed by the word of the speaker, but is inferred from something formally <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a>.

<p>Now, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> formally and explicitly revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are certainly dogmas in the strict sense when they are proposed or <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such are the articles of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>. Similarly, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> formally, but only implicitly, are dogmas in the strict sense when proposed or <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such, for example, are the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>, <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a>, some of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching about the Saviour, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc. All doctrines <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as being contained in revelation are understood to be formally revealed, explicitly or implicitly. It is a dogma of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in defining these two classes of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; and the deliberate denial of one of these dogmas certainly involves the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. There is a diversity of opinion about virtually <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, which has its roots in a diversity of opinion about the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">F<font size=-2>AITH</font></a>). It is enough to say here that, according to some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, virtually <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> belong to the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and become dogmas in the strict sense when defined or proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and according to others, they do not belong to the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> prior to their definition, but become strict dogmas when defined; and, according to others, they do not belong to the material object of Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all, nor become dogmas in the strict sense when defined, but may be called mediately-Divine or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dogmas. In the hypothesis that virtually revealed conclusions do not belong to the material object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it has not been <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in defining these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, in relation to these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> is a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> theologically certain, which cannot lawfully be denied &#151; and though the denial of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dogma would not be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the strict sense, it could entail the sundering of the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and expulsion from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.


<h2 id="section2">Divisions</h2>

<p>The divisions of dogma follow the lines of the divisions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Dogmas can be (1) general or special; (2) material or formal; (3) pure or mixed; (4) symbolic or non-symbolic; (5) and they can differ according to their various degrees of necessity.

<p>(1) General dogmas are a part of the revelation meant for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and transmitted from the Apostles; while special dogmas are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed in <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">private revelations</a>. Special dogmas, therefore, are not, strictly speaking, dogmas at all; they are not <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> transmitted from the Apostles; nor are they defined or proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the acceptance of the faithful generally.

<p>(2) Dogmas are called material (or Divine, or dogmas in themselves, <em>in se</em>) when abstraction is made from their definition by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when they are considered only as revealed; and they are called formal (or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, or "in relation to us", <em>quoad nos</em>) when they are considered both as revealed and defined. Again, it is evident that material dogmas are not dogmas in the strict sense of the term.

<p>(3) Pure dogmas are those which can be known only from revelation, as the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, etc.; while mixed dogmas are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which can be known from revelation or from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> reasoning as the existence and attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Both classes are dogmas in the strict sense, when considered as revealed and defined.

<p>(4) Dogmas contained in the symbols or creeds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are called symbolic; the remainder are non-symbolic. Hence all the articles of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> are dogmas &#151; but not all dogmas are called technically <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, though an ordinary dogma is sometimes spoken of as an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>.

<p>(5) Finally, there are dogmas <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in which is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as a means to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in others is rendered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> only by Divine precept; and some dogmas must be explicitly known and believed, while with regard to others implicit <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is sufficient.
<h2 id="section3">Objective character of dogmatic truth; intellectual belief in dogma</h2>

<p>As a dogma is a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> character and objective reality of dogma depend on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> character and objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. We will here apply to dogma the conclusions developed at greater length under the heading of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Are dogmas considered merely as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, real objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>? Are we bound to believe them with the mind? Should we admit the distinction between fundamental and non-fundamental dogmas?

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> deny the existence of Divine <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, and consequently of religious dogmas. A certain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of mystics has taught that what Christ inaugurated in the world was "a new life". The <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">"Modernist"</a> theory by reason of its recent condemnation calls for fuller treatment. There are different shades of opinion among <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>. Some of them do not, apparently, deny all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> value to dogma (cf. Le Roy, "Dogme et Critique"). Dogma, like revelation, they say, is expressed in terms of action. Thus when the Son of (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said "to have come down from heaven", according to all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> He did not come down, as bodies descend or as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are conceived to pass from place to place, but the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> is described in terms of action. So when we profess our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, we mean, according to M. Le Roy, that we have to act towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as sons; but neither the fatherhood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the other dogmas of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such as the Trinity, the Incarnation, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, etc. imply of necessity any objective <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conception of fatherhood, Trinity, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, etc., or convey any <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to the mind. According to other writers, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has addressed no revelation to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Revelation, they say, began as a consciousness of right and wrong &#151; and the evolution or development of revelation was but the progressive development of the religious sense until it reached its highest level, thus far, in the modern liberal and democratic State. Then, according to these writers, the dogmas of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, considered as dogmas, have no meaning for the mind, we need not believe them mentally; we may reject them &#151; it is enough if we employ them as guides for our actions. (See <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">M<font size=-2>ODERNISM</font></a>.) Over against this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made a revelation to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. There are, no doubt, relative <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, and some of the dogmas of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be expressed under the symbolism of action, but they also convey to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> a meaning distinct from action. The fatherhood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may imply that we should act towards Him as children towards a father &#151; but it also conveys to the mind definite analogical conceptions of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Creator. And there are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, such as the Trinity, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, etc. which are absolute objective facts, and which could be believed even if their practical consequences were ignored or were deemed of little value. The dogmas of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, the Trinity, the Incarnation, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, a future judgment, etc. have an objective reality and are facts as really and truly as it a fact that <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> was Emperor of the Romans, and that George Washington was first President of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>(2) Abstracting from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> definition, we are bound to render to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the homage of our assent to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> once we are satisfied that He has spoken. Even <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> admit, hypothetically, that if there be an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Being distinct from the world, we should pay Him the homage of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> His Divine word.

<p>(3) Hence it is not permissible to distinguish <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> as fundamental and non-fundamental in the sense that some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, though known to have been revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be lawfully denied. But while we should believe, at least implicitly, every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> attested by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are free to admit that some are in themselves more important than others, more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> than others, and that an explicit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of some is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> while an implicit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in others is sufficient.
<h2 id="section4">Dogma and the Church</h2>

<p>Revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> become formally dogmas when defined or proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. There is considerable hostility, in modern times, to dogmatic religion when considered as a body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and still more when considered as defined by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The theory of dogma which is here expounded depends for its acceptance on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching office of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>. It will be sufficient to notice the following points, (1) the reasonableness of the definition of dogma; (2) the immutability of dogma; (3) the necessity for Church unity of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in dogma (4) the inconveniences which are alleged to be associated with the definition of dogma.

<p>(1) Against the theory of interpretation of Scripture by private judgement, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> regard as absolutely unacceptable the view that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealed a body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> to the world and appointed no official teacher of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, no authoritative judge of controversy; this view is as unreasonable as would be the notion that the civil legislature makes <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and then commits to individual private judgment the right and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of interpreting the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and deciding controversies. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> are endowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the privilege of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> in discharge of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of universal teacher in the sphere of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; hence we have an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> testimony that the dogmas defined and delivered to us by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> contained in <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>.

<p>(2) The dogmas of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are immutable. <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> hold that religious dogmas, as such, have no <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> meaning, that we are not bound to believe them mentally, that they may be all <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, that it is sufficient if we use them a guides to action; and accordingly they teach that dogmas are not immutable, that they should be changed when the spirit of the age is opposed to them, when they lose their value as rules for a liberal <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. But in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> that <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> is addressed to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and expresses real objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, dogmas are immutable Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. It is an immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for all time that <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> was Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and George Washington first President of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. So according to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, these are and will be for all time immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> &#151; that there are <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">three Persons in God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for us, that He arose from the dead, that He founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that He instituted the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. We may distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> themselves and the language in which they are expressed. The full meaning of certain <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> has been only gradually brought out; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> will always remain. Language may change or may receive a new meaning; but we can always learn what meaning was attached to particular words in the past.

<p>(3) We are bound to believe <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> irrespective of their definition by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if we are satisfied that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed them. When they are proposed or <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and thus become dogmas, we are bound to believe them in order to maintain the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">H<font size=-2>ERESY</font></a>).

<p>(4) Finally, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not admit that, as is sometimes alleged, dogmas are the arbitrary creations of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, that they are multiplied at will, that they are devices for keeping the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in subjection, that they are obstacles to conversions. Some of these are points of controversy which cannot be settled without reference to more fundamental questions. Dogmatic definitions would be arbitrary if there were no Divinely instituted <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching office in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but if, as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> maintain, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has established in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> office, dogmatic definitions cannot be considered arbitrary. The same <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> which preserves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> will preserve her from inordinate multiplication of dogmas. She cannot define arbitrarily. We need only observe the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> to see that dogmas are not multiplied inordinately. And as dogmatic definitions are but the authentic interpretation and declaration of the meaning of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, they cannot be considered devices for keeping the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in subjection, or reasonable obstacles to conversions, on the contrary, the authoritative definition of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and condemnation of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, are powerful arguments leading to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> those who seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> earnestly.
<h2 id="section5">Dogma and religion</h2>

<p>It is sometimes charged that in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in consequence of its dogmas, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> consists merely in speculative <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and external sacramental formalities. It is a strange charge, arising from prejudice or from lack of acquaintance with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life. Religious life in conventual and monastic establishments is surely not a merely external formality. The external religious exercises of the ordinary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, such as public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, confession, <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, etc. suppose careful and serious internal self-examination and self-regulation, and various other acts of internal religion. We need only to observe the public civic life of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, their philanthropic works, their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, charitable organizations, to be convinced that dogmatic religion does not degenerate into mere external formalities. On the contrary, in non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies a general decay of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life follows the dissolution of dogmatic religion. Were the dogmatic system of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with its authoritative <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">head</a>, done away with, the various systems of private judgment would not save the world from relapsing into and following <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> ideals. Dogmatic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is not the be-all and end-all of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life; but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> serves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, honours the Trinity, loves Christ, obeys the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, frequents the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, assists at Mass, observes the Commandments, because he believes mentally in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the Trinity, in the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of keeping the Commandments, and he believes in them as objective immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>.
<h2 id="section6">Dogma and science</h2>

<p>But, it is objected, dogma checks investigation, antagonizes independence of thought, and makes scientific <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> impossible. This difficulty may be supposed to be put by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> or by unbelievers. We will consider it from both points of view.

<p>(1) Beyond scientific investigation and freedom of thought <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> recognize the guiding influence of dogmatic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also profess to adhere to certain great dogmatic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are supposed to impede scientific investigation and to conflict with the findings of modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Old difficulties against the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> or its demonstrability, against the dogma of Creation, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion have been dressed in a new garb and urged by a modern <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of scientists principally from the discoveries in geology, paleontology, biology, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, comparative <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, and physiology. But <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, no less than <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the Creation, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the Incarnation, in the possibility of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; they too, maintain that there can be no discord between the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conclusions of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and the dogmas of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> rightly understood. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, therefore, cannot consistently complain that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dogmas impede scientific investigation. But it is urged that in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> are not determined by private judgment, behind the dogmas of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is the living bulwark of her episcopate. True, behind dogmatic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> recognize <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; but this puts no further restraint on <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> freedom &#151; it only raises the question as to the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not believe that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealed a body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and appointed no living authority to unfold, to teach, to safeguard that body of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, to decide controversies; but the authority of the episcopate under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> to control <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity is correlative with, and arises from their authority to teach <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The existence of judges and magistrates does not extend the range of our civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> &#151; they are rather a living authority to interpret and apply the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Similarly, episcopal authority has for its range the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of revelation, and it prohibits only what is inconsistent with the full scope of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>(2) In discussing the question with unbelievers we note that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is "the observation and classification, or co-ordination, of the individual facts or phenomena of nature". Now a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is absolutely free in the prosecution of scientific research according to the terms of this definition. There is no prohibition or restriction on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in regard to the observation and co-ordination of the phenomena of Nature. But some scientists do not confine themselves to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> as defined by themselves. They propound theories often unwarranted by experimental observation. One will maintain as a "scientific" <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that His existence is unknowable &#151; another that the world has not been created; another will deny in the name of "science" the existence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; another, the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation. Surely these denials are not warranted by scientific methods. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dogma and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority limit <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity only so far as may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of revelation. If non-believing scientists in their study of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> would apply the scientific method, which consists in observing, comparing, making hypotheses, and perhaps formulating scientific conclusions, they would readily see that dogmatic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in no way interferes with the legitimate freedom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in scientific research, the discharge of civic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, or any other form of activity that makes for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> enlightenment and progress. The service rendered by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in every department of learning and of social endeavour, is a fact which no amount of theorizing against dogma can set aside.
