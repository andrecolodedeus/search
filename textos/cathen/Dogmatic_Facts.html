<h1>Dogmatic Facts</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>By a <em>dogmatic fact</em>, in wider sense, is meant any fact connected with a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and on which the application of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> to a particular case depends.

<p>The following questions involve dogmatic facts in the wider sense: Is <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, for instance, really and truly <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> [1909], duly elected and recognized by the Universal Church? This is connected with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, for it is a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that every pontiff duly elected and recognized by the universal Church is a successor of Peter. Again, was this or that council ecumenical? This, too, is connected with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, for every <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> is endowed with <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Universal Church. The question also whether <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> really die in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is connected with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, for every one who dies in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is saved.

<p>In the stricter sense the term <em>dogmatic fact</em> is confined to books and spoken discourses, and its meaning will be explained by a reference to the condemnation by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> of five propositions taken from the posthumous book of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, entitled "Augustinus". It might be asked, for example, whether the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could define that <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> really was the author of the book entitled "Augustinus". It is conceded that he could not. He may speak of it as the work of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, because, in general repute, at least, it was regarded as the work of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>. The precise authorship of a book is called a personal fact. The question turned on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the book. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> admitted that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> enunciated in the condemned propositions was <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>; but they maintained that the condemned <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was not taught in the "Augustinus". This brings us to what are called "particular facts of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>". Thus it is a fact that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>, and that there are <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Three Persons in God</a>; here the same thing is fact and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> admitted that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is competent to deal with particular facts of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but not to determine the meaning of a book. The controversy was then carried to the meaning of the book. Now it is conceded that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> cannot define the purely internal, subjective, perhaps singular meaning, which an author might attach to his words. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in certain cases, can determine the meaning of a book judged by the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of interpretation. And when a book or propositions from a book are condemned, "in the sense of the author", they are condemned in the sense in which the book or propositions would be understood when interpreted according to the ordinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of language. The same formula may be condemned in one author and not in another, because, interpreted by the context and general argument of the author, it may be unorthodox in one case and not in another. In the strict sense, therefore, a dogmatic fact may be defined as "the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> or heterodox meaning of a book or proposition"; or as a "fact that is so connected with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> that a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the fact is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for teaching and conserving sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>". When we say that a book contains unorthodox <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, we convey that a certain <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is unorthodox; here we have close connection between fact and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The Church and dogmatic facts</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> distinguished between "fact" and "dogma". They held that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in defining <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and in condemning <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in defining facts which are not contained in <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, and consequently that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in declaring that a particular <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, in a particular sense, was found in the "Augustinus" of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>. This would confine the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to mere abstract doctrines, a view that cannot be accepted. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> are unanimous in teaching that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, not only in defining what is formally contained in <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, but also in defining virtually <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, or generally in all definitions and condemnations which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for safe-guarding the body of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Whether it is to be regarded as a <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> <em>de fide</em>, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in definitions about dogmatic facts, is disputed among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>. The reason of this difference in opinion will appear below (3). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in all ages, has exercised the right of pronouncing with authority on dogmatic facts; and this right is essential to her teaching office. She has always claimed the right of defining that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in the sense in which it is contained in their books, or in their discourses, is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> writer, in the sense in which it is contained in his writings, is <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. We can scarcely imagine a theory like that of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> advanced within the sphere of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. We can scarcely conceive it to be held that a judge and a jury may pronounce on an abstract proposition of <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a>, but cannot find that a particular paragraph in a book or newspaper is libellous in the sense in which it is written. If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could not define the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> or unorthodox sense of books, sermons, conferences, and discourses generally, she might still be <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in regard to abstract <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but she could not fulfil her task as practical teacher of humanity, not protect her children from actual concrete dangers to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Faith and dogmatic facts</h2>

<p>The more extreme <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, distinguishing between <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and fact, taught that the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is the proper object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but that to the definition of fact only respectful silence is due. They refused to subscribe the formula of the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, or would subscribe only with a qualification, on the ground that subscription implied internal assent and acquiescence. The less extreme party, though limiting the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Church's infallibility</a> to the question of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, thought that the formula might be signed absolutely and without qualification, on the ground that, by general usage, subscription implied assent to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, but, in relation to the fact, only external reverence. But the definitions of dogmatic facts demand real internal assent; though about the nature of the assent and its relation to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are not unanimous. Some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that definitions of dogmatic facts, and especially of dogmatic facts in the wider acceptation of the term, are believed by Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For instance, the proposition, "every pope duly elected is the successor of Peter", is formally revealed. Then, say these <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the proposition, "Pius X has been duly elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>", only shows that <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> is included in the general revealed proposition that "every <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> duly elected is the successor of Peter". And they conclude that the proposition, "<a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> is successor to Peter", is a formally revealed proposition; that it is believed by Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that it is a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <em>de fide</em>; that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in defining such doctrines. Other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that the definitions of dogmatic facts, in the wider and stricter acceptation, are received, not by Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which some call mediate Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They hold that in such syllogisms as this: "Every duly elected pontiff is Peter's successor; but <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, for example, is a duly elected pontiff; therefore he is a successor of Peter", the conclusion is not formally revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is inferred from a revealed and an unrevealed proposition, and that consequently it is believed, not by Divine, but by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It would then also be held that it has not been formally defined <em>de fide</em> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in the definition of dogmatic facts. It would be said technically to be theologically certain that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in these definitions; and this <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> cannot lawfully be questioned. That all are bound to give internal assent to Church definitions of dogmatic facts is evident from the correlative <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of teacher and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> taught. As it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to define the meaning of a book or proposition, correlatively it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the subjects who are taught to accept this meaning.
