<h1>Dogmatic Theology</h1>  

<p>Dogmatic theology is that part of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which treats of the theoretical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His works (<em>dogmata fidei</em>), whereas <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> has for its subject-matter the practical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> (<em>dogmata morum</em>). At times, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> or fundamental theology is called "general dogmatic theology", dogmatic theology proper being distinguished from it as "special dogmatic theology". However, according to present-day usage, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> is no longer treated as part of dogmatic theology but has attained the rank of an independent <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, being generally regarded as the introduction to and foundation of dogmatic theology. The present article shall deal first with those questions which are <em>fundamental</em> to dogmatic theology and then briefly review its historical development due to the acumen and indefatigable industry with which the theologians of every civilized country and of every century have cultivated and promoted this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Definition and nature of dogmatic theology</h2>

<p>To define dogmatic theology, it will be best to start from the general notion of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Considered etymologically, theology (Gr. <em>Theologia, i.e. peri Theou logos</em>) means objectively the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subjectively, the scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things. If defined as the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>doctrina de Deo</em>), the name of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> applies as well to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is cast into scientific form in natural theology or <a href="../cathen/14569a.htm">theodicy</a>. However, unless theodicy is free from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, it cannot lay claim to the name of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. For this reason, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> doctrines about the gods, must at once be set aside as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> theology. The theology of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also, so far as it contains grave <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, must be excluded. In a higher and more perfect sense we call theology that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things which, objectively, is based on <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, and subjectively, is viewed in the light of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Theology thus broadens out into <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> (<em>doctrina fidei</em>) and embraces not only the particular doctrines of God's <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">essence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">triune personality</a>, but all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Patristic era did not, as a rule, take theology in this wide sense. For the earlier Fathers, strictly limiting the term <em>theology</em> to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, distinguished it from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of His external activity, especially from the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and Redemption, which they included under the name of the "Divine economy". Now, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not only the primary object but also the first principle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> theology, then its ultimate end likewise must be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is to say it must teach, effect, and promote union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through religion Consequently, it lies in the very essence of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> not only of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also of religion (<em>doctrina religionis</em>). It is this triple function which gave rise to the old adage of the School: <em>Theologia Deum docet, a Deo docetur, ad Deum ducit</em> (Theology teaches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is taught by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and leads to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>).

<p>However, neither <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> theology in general nor dogmatic theology in particular is sufficiently specified by its material object or its end, since natural theology also treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things and shows that union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. What essentially distinguishes the two <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> is the so-called formal principle or formal object. Supernatural theology considers <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things solely in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light of external revelation and internal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, analyzes them scientifically, proves them and penetrates as far as possible into their meaning. From this it follows that theology comprehends all those and only those doctrines which are to be found in the sources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> Church proposes to us. Now, among these <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> there are many which reason, by its own natural power, can discover, comprehend, and demonstrate, especially those that pertain to natural theology and ethics. These <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, however accessible to unaided reason, receive a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> colouring only by being at the same time supernaturally revealed and accepted on the ground of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> infallible authority. The act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> being nothing else than the unconditional surrender of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to the sovereign authority of the self-revealing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is plain that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology is not a purely <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> like mathematics or <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>; it must rather, of its very nature be an authoritative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, basing its teachings, especially of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on the authority of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> Church established by Christ; for it is the Divine mission of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to preserve intact the entire deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>depositum fidei</em>), to preach and explain it authoritatively. There are, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, many non-Catholics and even some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who are irritated at seeing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology bow before an external authority. They take offence at <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions <em>ex cathedra</em>, the censure of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions, the index of forbidden books, the Syllabus, the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> against Modernism. Yet all these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations flow naturally and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> from the formal principle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> theology: the existence of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> and the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to demand, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, an unwavering <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. To reject the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be equivalent to abandoning <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, and contemning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself, who can neither deceive nor be deceived, since He is Truth itself, and who speaks through the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently, theology as a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, if it would avoid the danger of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, must ever remain under the tutelage and guidance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, theology without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is as absurd as theology without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Dogmatic theology, then, may be defined as the scientific exposition of the entire theoretical <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself and His external activity, based on the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.


<h2 id="section2">Dogmatic theology as a science</h2>

<p>Considering that theology depends essentially on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a serious difficulty arises at once. How, one may ask, can theology claim to be a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in the genuine sense of the word? If the aim and result of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> investigation is settled in advance by an authority that attributes to itself <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> and will brook no contradiction, if the line of march is, as it were, clearly mapped out and strictly prescribed, how can there be any question of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> or of scientific freedom? Are not the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, supposed to demonstrate an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, after all mere <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> play, sham <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, reasoning made to order? Prejudice against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology, prevalent in the world at large, is beginning to bear fruit; in many countries the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties, still existing in the state <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, are looked upon as so much useless ballast, and the demand is being made to relegate them to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, where they can no longer injure the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> freedom of the people. The downright unfairness of this attitude is obvious when one considers that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> sprang up and developed in the shadow of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology; and that, moreover, the exaggeration of scientific freedom may prove fatal to the profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> as well. Unless it presuppose certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, which can no more be demonstrated than many mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> can achieve nothing; and unless it recognize the limits that are set to investigation, the boasted freedom will degenerate into lawless and arbitrary <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logician</a> starts from notions, the jurist from legal texts, the historian from facts, the chemist from material substances as things which demand no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in his case, so the theologian receives his material from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and deals with it according to the rules which the scientist applies in his own branch.

<p>The view, moreover, that scientific research is absolutely free and independent of all authority is fanciful and distorted. To the freedom of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, the authority of the individual <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as well, sets an impassable limit. Even the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> would have to exercise its authority in the form of punishment if a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professor, presuming on the freedom of scientific thought and research, should teach openly that burglary, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, revolution, and <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> are permissible. We may concede that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, being subject to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, is more closely bound than the professor of the secular <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Yet the difference is one of degree only, inasmuch as every <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and every investigator is bound by the moral and religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of subordination. Some <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, e.g. Durandus and Vasquez, denied to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> theology a strictly scientific character, on the ground that the content of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is obscure and incapable of demonstration. But their argument does not carry conviction. At most it proves that dogmatic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is not of the same kind and order as the profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. What is essential to any <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is not internal evidence, but merely <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of its first principles.

<p>There are many profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> which borrow unproved from a superior <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> their highest principles; these are the so-called <em>lemmata</em>, subsidiary propositions, which serve as premises for further conclusions. The theologian does the same. He, too, borrows the first principles of his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> from the higher <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> without proving them. Every subaltern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> supposes of course in the superior discipline the power to give a strict demonstration of the assumed premises. But all scientific axioms rest ultimately on <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> itself is unable to prove strictly all its principles all it can do is to defend them against attack. It is plain then that every <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> without exception rests on axioms and postulates which, though certain, yet admit of no demonstration. The mathematician is aware that the existence of geometry, the surest and most palpable of all <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, depends entirely on the soundness of the postulate of parallels. Nevertheless, this very postulate is far from being demonstrable. In fact, since no convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it was forthcoming, there has arisen since the time of Gauss a more general, non-Euclidean geometry, of which the Euclidean is only a special case. Why, then, should <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology, because of its postulates, <em>lemmata</em>, and mysteries, be denied the name of a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>? Apart from the domain of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> proper, the theologian may approach the numerous controversial questions and more intricate problems with the same freedom as is enjoyed by any other scientist. One thing, however, must never be lost sight of. No <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is at liberty to upset theorems which have been established once and for all; they must be regarded as unshaken <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> upon which the entire structure is based. Similarly, the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> must not be looked upon by the theologian as troublesome barriers, but as beacon-lights that warn the mariner, show him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> course, and preserve him from shipwreck.
<h2 id="section3">Methods of dogmatic theology</h2>

<p>Whereas other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, as, for instance, theodicy, begin with proving the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, it lies beyond the scope of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to discover dogmatic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. The subject-matter with which the student of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> has to deal is offered to him in the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and, reduced to its briefest form, is to be found in the Catechism. If the theologian is content with deriving the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> from the sources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and with explaining them, he is occupied with "positive" theology. Guided by the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he calls history and criticism to his aid to find in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> the genuine unalloyed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If to this positive element is joined a polemic tendency, we have "controversial" theology, which was carried to its highest perfection in the seventeenth century by Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. Positive theology must prove its theses by conclusive arguments drawn from <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>; hence it is closely related to <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> and history. As <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, the theologian must first of all accept the inspiration of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But even when elucidating its meaning, he will always bear in mind the unanimous interpretation of the Fathers, the hermeneutical principles of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the directions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In his character as historian, the theologian must not lay aside his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and in the Divine institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if he is to give a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and objective account of tradition, of the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and of patrology. For, just as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, being the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was written under the immediate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, so Tradition was, and is, guided in a special manner by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who preserves it from being curtailed, mutilated, or falsified.

<p>Consequently, he who from the outset declares the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> to be an ordinary book, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and prophecies impossible and old-fashioned, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a great institution for deadening thought, the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> prattlers, is quite incapable, even from a purely scientific standpoint, of understanding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> momentous <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. From this we may conclude how unecclesiastical and at the same time how unscientific are those historians who prefer to explain the works of the Fathers without due regard for <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, which was the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> environment in which they lived and breathed. For it is only when we discover the living link which bound them to the Apostolic Tradition of which they are witnesses, that we shall understand their writings and establish the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of some passages, as for instance, the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> <em>apocatastasis</em> in the writings of <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>. When <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, by his Motu Proprio of 1 Sept., 1910, solemnly <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to adhere to these principles, he did more than recall to our minds the time-hallowed rules of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; he freed history and criticism from those baneful excrescences which impeded the growth of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.

<p>When the dogmatic material with the help of the historical method has been derived from its sources, another momentous task awaits the theologian: the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> appreciation, the speculative examination and elucidation of the material brought to light. This is the purpose of the "scholastic" method from which "scholastic theology" takes its name.

<p>The scope of the scholastic method is fourfold: <ul><li>to open up completely the content of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and to analyze it by means of dialectics; <li>to establish a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> connection between the various <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and to unite them in a well-knit system; <li>to derive new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, called "theological conclusions" from the premises by syllogistic reasoning; <li>to find reasons, analogies, congruous arguments for the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>;</ul>

<p>But above all to show that the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though beyond the reach of reason, are not contrary to its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> but can be made acceptable to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. It is evident that the ultimate purpose of these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculations cannot be to resolve <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> finally into mere natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, or to strip the mysteries of their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character, but to explain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to provide for them a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> basis, to bring them nearer to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Faith must ever remain the solid rock-bottom on which reason builds up, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in its turn strives after understanding (<em>fides quoerens intellectum</em>). Hence the famous axiom of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>: <em>Credo ut inlellegam</em>. However highly one may esteem the results of positive theology, one thing is certain: the scientific character of dogmatic theology does not rest so much on the exactness of its <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> and historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> as on the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> grasp of the content of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. But in attempting this task, the theologian cannot look for aid to modern philosophy with its endless confusion, but to the glorious past of his own <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. What else are the modern systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, sceptical criticism, Positivism, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, Monism, etc., than ancient <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> cast into new moulds? Rightly does <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology cling to the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and eternal philosophy of common sense, which was established by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socratic</a> School, carried to its highest perfection by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, purified from the minutest traces of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of the thirteenth century.

<p>This is the Aristotelo-scholastic philosophy, which has gained an ever stronger foothold in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions of learning. Guided by sound pedagogical principles, Popes <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> officially prescribed this philosophy as a preparation for the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and recommended it as a model method for the speculative treatment of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. While in his famous <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" of 8 Sept., 1907, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> praises positive theology and frankly recognizes its necessity, yet he sounds a note of warning not to become so absorbed in it as to neglect <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, which alone can impart a scientific grasp of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. These <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">papal rescripts</a> were probably inspired by the sad experience that any other than <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, instead of elucidating and clarifying, only falsifies and destroys <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, as is clearly shown by the history of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, the philosophy of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesianism</a>, G&uuml;ntherianism, and <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>. The development also of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theology, which, entering into close union with modern philosophy, swayed to and fro between the extremes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and unfaith and did not even recoil from <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, is a warning example for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theologian. This does not mean that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theology has received no stimulus whatever from modern philosophy since the days of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> (d. 1804). As a matter of fact, the critical tendency has quickened the critico-historical sense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theologians in regard to method and demonstration, has given more breadth and depth to their statement of problems, and has shown fully the value of the "theoretical <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>" as the starting-point of every scientific investigation. All these advances, as far as they mark real progress, have exerted a salutary influence on theology also. But they can never repair the material damages caused to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a>, when, abandoning <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, it went hand in hand with <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> and other champions of our age. But since the Aristotelo-scholastic philosophy also is capable of continual development, there is reason to expect for the future a progressive improvement of speculative theology.

<p>Another method of arriving at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, which appeals rather to the heart and the feelings than to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and sensibly imparts a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things through <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> meditation. As long as <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> keeps in touch with scholasticism and does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> completely, it is entitled to existence for the simple reason that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lays hold on the whole man, and penetrates his thoughts, desires, and sentiments. The greatest mystics, as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, and Bonaventure, were at the same time distinguished <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. A heart that has preserved the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and simplicity of its childhood, takes delight even now in the writings of <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Henry Suso</a> (d. 1365). But whenever <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> emancipates itself from the guidance of reason and makes light of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it readily falls a prey to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> and pseudo-mysticism, which are the bane of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckhart</a>, whose propositions were condemned by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in 1329, is a warning example. There is little in the present trend of thought that would be favourable to <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. The scepticism which has poisoned the minds of our generation, the uncontrolled <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> for wealth, the feverish haste in commercial enterprises, even the dulling habit of reading the daily papers &#151; all these are only too apt to disturb the serene atmosphere of Divine contemplation, and play havoc with the interior life, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions under which alone the tender flower of mystical <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> can blossom. <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a> claims to possess in its immediate and immanent sense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a congenial soil for the growth of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>; this soil, however, does not receive its waters from the undefiled fountain-head of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but from the cisterns of Liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> pseudo-mysticism, which are tainted, either confessedly or secretly, by <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Relation of dogmatic theology to other disciplines</h2>

<p>At first, it was a thing altogether unknown to have different <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> branches as independent <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Dogmatic theology was the only discipline, and comprised <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, and canon law. This internal unity was also marked externally by the comprehensive name of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>scientia fidei</em>), or <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> (<em>scientia sacra</em>). First to assert its independence was canon law, which, together with dogmatic theology, was the chief study in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. But since the underlying principles of canon law, as the Divine constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, the power of ordinations, etc., were at the same time doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in dogmatic theology, there was little danger that the internal connection with and dependence on the principal <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> would be broken. Far longer did the union between dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> endure. They were treated in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> "Books of Sentences" and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "Summ&aelig;" as one <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. It was not until the seventeenth century, and then only for practical reasons, that <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> was separated from the main body of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Nor did this division degenerate into a formal separation of two strictly co-ordinated disciplines. Moral theology has always been conscious that the revealed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of morality are as much <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> as the theoretical <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, and that the entire <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life is based on the three <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, which are part of the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on justification. Hence the superior rank of dogmatic theology, which is not only the centre around which the other disciplines are grouped, but also the main stem from which they branch out. But the necessity of a further division of labour as well as the example of non-Catholic methods led to the independent development of other disciplines: <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>.

<p>The relation existing between <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, or fundamental theology as it has been called of late, and dogmatic theology is not that of a general to a particular <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; it is rather the relation of the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> to the temple or of the foundation to its superstructure. For both the method and the purpose of demonstration differ totally in the two branches. Whereas <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, intent upon laying the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, uses historical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> arguments, dogmatic theology on the other hand makes use of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> to prove the Divine character of the different <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubt</a> could only exist as to whether the discussion of the sources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the primacy, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and reason, belongs to <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> or to dogmatic theology. While a dogmatic treatment of these important questions has its advantages, yet from the practical standpoint and for reasons peculiar to the subject, they should be separated from dogmatic theology and referred to <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>. The practical reason is that the existing denominational differences demand a more thorough apologetic treatment of these problems; and again, the subject-matter itself contains nothing else than the preliminary and fundamental questions of dogmatic theology properly so called. A branch of the greatest importance, ever since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> with its allied disciplines, because that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> establishes the meaning of the texts <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the Scriptural argument. As the Biblical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> necessarily suppose the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the inspiration of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the Divine institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which alone, through the assistance of the Holy Ghost, is the rightful owner and authoritative interpreter of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, though enjoying full liberty in all other respects, must never lose its connection with dogmatic theology. Not even <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, though using the same critical methods as profane history, is altogether independent of dogmatic theology. As its object is to set forth the history of <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">God's kingdom</a> upon earth, it cannot repudiate or slight either the Divinity of Christ or the Divine foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without forfeiting its claim to be regarded as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a>. The same applies to other historic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, as the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, of councils, of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, patrology, symbolics, and <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a>. Pastoral theology, which embraces liturgy, homiletics, and catechetics, proceeded from, and bears close relationship to, <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>; its dependence on dogmatic theology needs, therefore, no further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.

<p>The relation between dogmatic theology and philosophy deserves special attention. To begin with, even when they treat the same subject, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is a fundamental difference between the two <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. For, as was said above, the formal principles of the two are totally different. But, this fundamental difference must not be exaggerated to the point of asserting, with the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, that something <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and vice versa, The theory of the "twofold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" in theology and history, which is only a variant of the same <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> principle, is therefore expressly <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> in the anti-Modernist <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But no less fatal would be the other extreme of identifying theology with philosophy, as was attempted by the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, later by <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Eriugena (d. about 877), Raymond Lullus (d. 1315), Pico della Mirandola (d. 1463), and by the modern <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>. To counteract this bold scheme, the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (Sess. III, cap. iv) solemnly declared that the two <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> differ essentially not only in their cognitive principle (faith, reason) and their object (<a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, rational <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), but also in their motive (Divine authority, evidence) and their ultimate end (<a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). But what is the precise relation between these <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>? The origin and dignity of revealed theology forbid us to assign to philosophy a superior or even a co-ordinate rank. Already <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and Philo of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in determining the relation of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to that part of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> which is directly concerned with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pronounced philosophy to be the "handmaid" of natural theology. When philosophy came into contact with revelation, this subordination was still more emphasized and was finally crystallized in the principle: <em>Philosophia est ancilla theologioe</em>. But neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor the theologians who insisted on this axiom, ever intended thereby to encroach on the freedom, independence, and dignity of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, to curtail its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, or to lower it to the position of a mere slave of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Their mutual relations are far more honourable. Theology may be conceived as a queen, philosophy as a noble lady of the court who performs for her mistress the most worthy and valuable services, and without whose assistance the queen would be left in a very helpless and embarrassing position. That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in examining the various systems, should select the philosophy which harmonized with her own revealed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself to be the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> philosophy by acknowledging a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the moral law, was so natural and obvious that it required no apology. Such a philosophy, however, existed among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of old, and was carried to an eminent degree of perfection by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Division and content of dogmatic theology</h2>

<p>Not only for non-Catholics, but also for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> it may be of interest to take a brief survey of the questions and problems generally discussed in dogmatic theology.
<h3 id="A">God (<em>de Deo uno et trino</em>)</h3>

<p>As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the central <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> around which all theology turns, dogmatic theology must begin with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, essentially one, Whose existence, essence, and attributes are to be investigated, While the arguments, strictly so called, for the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> are given in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or in <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, dogmatic theology insists upon the revealed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be known from creation by reason alone, that is, without external revelation or internal illumination by grace. From this it follows at once that <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> must be branded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and that <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> may not plead mitigating circumstances. Nor can <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a> be reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the natural knowableness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if, as the <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalists</a> assert, the consciousness of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, found in all races and ages, is due solely to the oral tradition of our forefathers and ultimately to the revelation granted in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> derived from the visible creation is at once discounted. The same must be said of the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a>, who fancy that our mind enjoys an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> essence, and is thus made certain of His existence. Likewise, to assume with <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> an inborn <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em><a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> Dei innata</em>) is out of the question; consequently, the knowableness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by mere reason, means in the last analysis that His existence can be demonstrated, as the anti-Modernist <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> prescribed by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> expressly affirms. But this method of arriving at a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is toilsome; for it must proceed by way of denying imperfection in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of ascribing to Him in higher excellence (<em>eminenter</em>) whatever perfections are found in creatures; nor does the light of revelation and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> elevate our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to an essentially higher plane. Hence all our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on this earth implies painful deficiencies which will not be filled except by the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>.

<p>The metaphysical essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is generally said to be self-existence, which means, however, the fullness of being (Gr. <em>autousia</em>), and not merely the negation of origin (<em>ens a se--ens non ab alio</em>). The so-called positive <a href="../cathen/01774b.htm">aseity</a> of Prof. Schell, meaning that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> realizes and produces Himself must be as uncompromisingly rejected as the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> confusion of <em>ens a se</em> with the impersonal <em>ens universale</em>. The relation existing between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> essence and His attributes may not be called a real distinction (theoretical Realism, Gilbert de La Porr&eacute;e), nor yet a purely <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> distinction of the mind (<a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>). Intermediary between these two objectionable extremes is the formal distinction of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>. But the virtual distinction of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> deserves preference in every regard, because it alone does not jeopardize the simplicity of the Divine Being. If self-existence is the fundamental attribute of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both the attributes of being and of operation must proceed from it as from their root. The first class includes <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>, simplicity, substantiality, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, immutability, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and immensity; to the second category belong omniscience and the Divine will. Besides, many theologians distinguish from both these categories the so-called moral attributes: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a>, fidelity, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, bounty, beauty, mercy, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a> is best treated in connection with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> simplicity and unity. The most difficult problems are those which concern <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, especially His foreknowledge of free future actions. For it is here that both <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> throw out their anchors to gain a secure hold for their respective systems of grace, the former for their <em>proemotio physica</em>, the latter for their <em>scientia media</em>. In treating of the Divine will, theologians insist on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> freedom in His external activity, and when discussing the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they prove that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can intend <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> neither as an end nor as a means to an end, but merely permits it for reasons both holy and wise. while some theologians use this chapter to treat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will and the allied questions of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and reprobation, others refer these subjects to the chapter on grace.

<p>Being the cornerstone of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity is thoroughly and extensively discussed, all the more because the Liberal theology of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> has relapsed into the ancient <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Antitrinitarians. The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">God's threefold personality</a>, traces of which may be found in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, can be conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and Tradition. The combat which the Fathers waged against <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>, and Subordinationism (Arius, Macedonius) aids considerably in shedding light on the mystery. Great importance attaches to the logos-doctrine of St. John; but as to its relation to the logos of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> Neoplatonists, the Jewish Philonians, and the early Fathers, many points are still in an unsettled condition. The reason why there are three Persons is the twofold procession immanent in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>: the procession of the Son from the Father by generation, and the procession of the Holy Ghost from both the Father and the Son by spiration. In view of the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>, the dogmatic justification of the addition of the <em>Filioque</em> in the Creed must be scientifically established. A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> understanding of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Trinity was attempted by the Fathers, especially by St. Augustine. The most important result was the cognition that the Divine generation must be conceived as a spiritual procession from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and the Divine spiration as a procession from the will or from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Active and passive generation, together with active and passive spiration, lead to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the four relations, of which, however, only three constitute <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to wit, active and passive generation (Father, Son), and passive spiration (Holy Ghost). The reason why active spiration does not result in a distinct (fourth) <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is because it is one and the same common function of the Father and the Son. The philosophy of this mystery includes also the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Divine properties, notions, appropriations, and missions. Finally, with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of circuminsession which summarizes the whole theology of the Trinity, the treatment of this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is brought to a fitting conclusion.
<h3 id="B">Creation (<em>de Deo creante</em>)</h3>

<p>The first act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> external activity is creation. The theologian investigates both the activity itself and the work produced. With regard to the former, the interest centres in creation out of nothing, around which, as along the circumference of a circle, are grouped a number of secondary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> plan of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the relation between the Trinity and creation, the freedom of the Creator, the creation in time, the impossibility of communicating the creative power to any creature. These momentous <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> not only perfect and purify the theistic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they also give the death-blow to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, matter) and to the Protean variations of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. As the beginning of the world supposes creation out of nothing, so its continuation supposes Divine conservation, which is nothing less than a continued creation. However, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creative activity is not thereby exhausted. It enters into every action of the creature, whether <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or free. What is the nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> universal co-operation with free rational beings? On this question <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> differ widely. The former regard the Divine activity as a previous, the latter as a simultaneous, concursus. According to <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinism</a>, it is only by conceiving the concursus as simultaneous that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> freedom in the creature can be secured, and that the essential <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the Creator can be maintained, the fact of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> notwithstanding. The crowning achievement of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creative activity is His providence and universal government which aims at the realization of the ultimate end of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory through His creatures.

<p>The work produced by creation is divided into three kingdoms, rising in tiers one above another: world; man; <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. To this triad correspond dogmatic <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmology</a>, anthropology, angelology. In discussing the first of these, the theologian must be satisfied with general outlines, e.g. of the Creator's activity described in the hexaemeron. Anthropology is more thoroughly treated, because man, the microcosm, is the centre of creation. Revelation tells us many things about man's nature, his origin and the unity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, the spirituality and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the relation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the origin of individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Above all, it tells us of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace with which man was adorned and which was intended to be a permanent possession of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. The discussion of man's original state must be preceded by a theory of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> without which the nature of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> could not be understood. But <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the willful repudiation of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> state, is one of the most important chapters. Its existence must be carefully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the sources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; its nature, the mode of its transmission, its effects, must be subjected to a thorough discussion. The fate of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> runs in many respects parallel to that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also were endowed with both <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and high natural excellences; some of them rose in rebellion against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were thrust into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> as demons. While the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are inimical to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, the faithful <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have been appointed to exercise the office of guardians over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.
<h3 id="C">Redemption (<em>de Deo Redemptore</em>)</h3>

<p>As the fall of man was followed by <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, so the chapter on creation is immediately followed by that on <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. Its three main divisions: <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>, Soteriology, Mariology, must ever remain in the closest connection. [For the first of these three (<a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>) see the separate article.]

<p><em>1. Soteriology</em>

<p>Soteriology is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the work of the Redeemer. As in <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> the leading <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a>, so here the main <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the natural mediatorship of Christ. After having disposed of the preliminary questions concerning the possibility, opportuneness, and necessity of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, as well as of those regarding the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the next subject to occupy our attention is the work of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> itself. This work reaches its climax in the vicarious satisfaction of Christ on the cross, and is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by His descent into limbo and His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension into heaven</a>. From a speculative standpoint, a thorough and comprehensive theory of satisfaction remains still a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desideratum, though promising attempts have often been made from the days of Anselm down to the present time. It will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to blend into one noble whole the hidden elements of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in the old patristic theory of ransom, the juridical conception of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> theory of atonement. The Redeemer's activity as Mediator stands out most prominently in His triple office of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and king, which is continued, after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension of Christ</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the teaching and pastoral office of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The central position is occupied by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which manifests the death on the cross as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice of propitiation, and proves the Redeemer to be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p><em>2. Mariology</em>

<p>Mariology, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, cannot be separated either from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or from the work of the Redeemer and therefore has the deepest connection with both <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> and Soteriology. Here the central <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the Divine Maternity, since this is at once the source of Mary's unspeakable dignity and of her surpassing fullness of grace. Just as the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a> of the Divinity and humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> stands or falls with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine Maternity, so too is this same maternity the foundation of all special privileges which were accorded to Mary on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dignity. These singular privileges are four: her Immaculate Conception, personal freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, perpetual virginity, and her bodily Assumption into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For the three former we have <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which are final. However, though Mary's bodily Assumption has not yet been solemnly declared an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>, nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has practically demonstrated such to be her <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> by celebrating from the earliest times the feast of the Assumption of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. Two more privileges are connected with Mary's dignity: her special mediatorship between the Redeemer and the redeemed and her exclusive right to hyperdulia. Of course, it is clear that the mediatorship of Mary is entirely subordinate to that of Her Divine Son and derives its whole efficacy and power therefrom. In order the better to understand the value and importance of Mary's peculiar right to such veneration, it will be well to consider, by way of contrast, the dulia paid to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and, again, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the veneration paid to <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and images. For the most part, dogmatic theologians prefer to treat these latter subjects under <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Communion of Saints</a>.

<p><em>3. Grace (De gratia)</em>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of grace is based entirely upon the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. A distinction is made between actual and <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, according as there is question of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> activity or merely the state of sanctification. But the crucial point in the whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace lies in the justification of the sinner, because, after all, the aim and object of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> is either to lay the foundation for the grace of justification when the latter is absent, or to preserve the grace of justification in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that already possesses it. The three qualities of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> are of the utmost importance: its necessity, its gratuitousness, and its universality. Although on the one hand we must avoid the exaggeration of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and of the followers of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, who denied the capability of unaided nature altogether in moral action, yet, on the other hand, theologians agree that fallen man is quite incapable, without the help of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">God's grace</a>, of either fulfilling the whole <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> or of resisting all strong <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for each and every salutary act, since all such acts bear a causal relation towards the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end of man. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and Semipelagianism are refuted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions based upon <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and Tradition. From the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of grace flows its second quality: gratuitousness. So entirely gratuitous is grace that no natural merit, no positive capability or preparation for it on the part of nature, nor even any purely natural petition, is able to move <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to give us <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>. The universality of grace rests fundamentally upon the absolute universality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will, which, in regard to adults, simply means His antecedent will to distribute sufficient grace to each and every <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whether he be already justified or in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether he be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, believer or infidel. But the salvific will, in as far as it is consequent and deals out just retribution, is no longer universal, but particular, for the reason that only those who persevere in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, whereas the wicked are condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. The question of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the blessed and the reprobation of the damned is admittedly one of the most difficult problems with which theology has to deal, and its solution is wrapped in impenetrable mystery. The same may be said of the relation existing between grace and the liberty of the human will. It would be cutting the Gordian knot rather than loosing it, were one to deny the efficacy of grace, as did <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, or again, following the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, deny the liberty of the will. The difficulty is rather in determining just how the acknowledged efficacy of grace is to be reconciled with human freedom. For centuries <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a>, Augustinians and Congruists have been toiling to clear up the matter. And while the system of grace known as <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretic</a> has endeavoured to harmonize the principles of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinism</a>, it has served but to double the difficulties instead of eliminating them.

<p>The second part of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace has to do with <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, which produces the state of habitual <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Preparatory to receiving this grace, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> undergoes a certain preliminary process, which is begun by <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the "beginning, root and foundation of all justification", and is completed and perfected by other <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> dispositions, such as contrition, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conception of justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a mere fiducial <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is quite as much at variance with revelation as is the <em>sola fides</em> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also differ from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in explaining the essence of justification itself. while <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> declares that justification consists in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> blotting-out of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and in an interior sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> would have it to be merely an external cloaking of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which still remain, and a mere imputation to the sinner of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> or <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are but two moments of one and the same act of justification, since the blotting-out of original and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is accomplished by the very fact of the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Although we may, to a certain extent, understand the nature of grace in itself, and may define it philosophically as a permanent quality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, an infused habit, an accidental and analogous participation of the Divine nature, yet its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature may be more easily understood from a consideration of its so-called formal effects produced in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. These are: <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, purity, beauty, friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adopted sonship. <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">Sanctifying grace</a> is accompanied by additional gifts, viz., the three <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, the infused moral virtues, the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the justified. This latter it is that crowns and completes the whole process of justification. We must also mention three qualities special to justification or <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>: its uncertainty, its inequality, and the possibility of its being lost. All of them are diametrically opposed to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conception, which asserts the absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of justification, its complete equality, and the impossibility of its being lost. Finally, the fruits of justification are treated. These ripen under the beneficent influence of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, which enables man to acquire merit through his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merit for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace is concluded with the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the existence, the conditions, and the objects of merit.

<p><em>4. Sacraments (De sacramentis)</em>

<p>This section is divided into two parts: the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in general and that on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in particular. After having defined exactly what is meant by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Christian sacraments</a>, and what is meant by the sacrament of nature and the Jewish rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as it prevailed in pre-Christian times, the next important step is to prove the existence of the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The essence of a sacrament requires three things: an outward, visible sign, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form of the sacrament; interior grace; and institution by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the difficult problem as to whether <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself determined the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form of each sacrament specifically or only generically the solution must be sought through dogmatic and historical investigations. Special importance attaches to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and an efficacy <em>ex opere operato</em> is attributed to them. Theologians dispute as to the nature of this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, i.e. whether it is physical or merely moral. In the case of each sacrament, regard must be had to two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the recipient and the minister. The objective efficacy of a sacrament is wholly independent of the personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> or the individual <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the minister. The only requisite is that he who confers the sacrament intend to do what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does. As regards the recipient of a sacrament, a distinction must be made between valid and worthy reception; the conditions differ with the various <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But since the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is required for validity, it is evident that no one can be forced to receive a sacrament.

<p>Furthermore, as regards the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in particular, the conclusions reached with reference to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in general of course hold good. Thus in the case of the first two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation, we must prove in detail the existence of the three requisites mentioned above, as well as the disposition of both the minister and the recipient. The question whether their reception is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or only of precept must also be examined. More than ordinary care is called for in the discussion of the Eucharist, which is not only a sacrament, but also the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. Everything centres of course around the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ</a> under the appearances of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>. His presence there is effected by means of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> of the Eucharistic elements and lasts as long as the accidents of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> remain incorrupt. The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the totality of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> means that in each individual species the whole Christ, flesh and blood, body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> Divinity and humanity, is <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is, of course, a great mystery, one that rivals that of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a>. It presents to us a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> utterly variance with the testimony of our senses, asking us, as it does, to assent to the continued existence of the Eucharistic species without their subject, a sort of spiritual existence, unconfined by space, yet of a human body, and, again, the simultaneous presence of Christ in many different places. The <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of the Eucharist is established by the presence of the three essential elements. The outward sign consists in the Eucharistic forms of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> and the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Its institution by Christ is guaranteed both by the promise of Christ and by the words of institution at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. Finally, the interior effects of grace are produced by the worthy reception of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. As Christ is wholly present in each species, the reception of the Eucharist under one species is sufficient to obtain fully all the fruits of the sacrament. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> need not be communicated to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, though at times the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has so allowed it to be, but not in any sense as though such were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Not everyone is capable of pronouncing the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> with sacramental effect, but only duly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and priests; for to them alone did Christ communicate the power of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. A distinct phase of the Eucharist is its sacrificial character. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not only from the oldest Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> practice of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, but also from certain prophecies of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and from the Gospel narrative of the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. To find the physical essence of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, we must consider its essential dependence on, and relation to, the bloody sacrifice of the Cross; for the Mass is a commemoration of the latter, its representation, its renewal, and its application. This intrinsically relative character of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a> does not in the least destroy or lessen the universality and oneness of the sacrifice on the Cross, but rather presupposes it; likewise the intrinsic propriety of the Mass is shown precisely in this, that it neither effects nor claims to effect anything else than the application of the fruits of the sacrifice of the Cross to the individual, and this in a sacrificial manner. The essence of the sacrifice is generally thought to consist neither in the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> nor in the Communion of the celebrant, but in the double <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Widely divergent are the views of the theologians as to the metaphysical essence of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a>, that is to say, as to the question how far the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a real sacrifice is verified in the double <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. A concurrence of opinion on this point is all the more difficult owing to the fact that the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrifice is involved in no little obscurity. As regards the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a>, it has all the effects of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrifice: adoration, thanksgiving, impetration, atonement. Most of its effects are <em>ex opere operato</em>, while some depend on the co-operation of the participants.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> presupposes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, a power clearly indicated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the words with which Christ instituted this sacrament (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs23">John 20:23</a>). Moreover, this power is abundantly attested both by the patristic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power of the Keys and by the history of the ancient penitential system. As at the time of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianism</a> it was a question of vindicating the universality of this power, so nowadays it is a matter of defending its absolute necessity and its judicial form against the attacks of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. These three qualities manifest at the same time the intrinsic nature and the essence of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. The universality of the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> means that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without exception, supposing, of course, contrition for the same, can be remitted in this sacrament. Owing to its absolute necessity and its judicial form, however, the sacrament really becomes a tribunal of penance in which the penitent is at once plaintiff, defendant, and witness, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> acts as judge. The matter of the sacrament consists in the three acts of the penitent: contrition, confession, and satisfaction while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is its form. To act as judge in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, the confessor needs more than <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>: he must also have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which may be restricted more or less by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors. As the validity of this sacrament, unlike that of the others, depends essentially on the worthiness of its reception, great attention must be paid to the acts of the penitent. Most important of all is contrition with the purpose of amendment, containing, as it does, the virtue of penance. The opinion, held by many of the early <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, that perfect contrition is required for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, is quite irreconcilable with the <em>ex opere operato</em> efficacy of the sacrament; for sorrow, springing from the motive of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, suffices of itself to free the sinner from all guilt, quite antecedent to, and apart from, the sacrament, though not indeed without a certain relation to it. According to the mind of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, imperfect contrition (attrition), even when actuated by the fear of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, is sufficient for the validity of the sacrament, though we should, of course, strive to call in nobler motives. Therefore the addition of a formal <em>caritas initialis</em> to attrition, as the Contritionists of today demand for the validity of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, is superfluous, at least so far as validity is concerned. The contrite confession, which is the second act of the penitent, manifests the interior sorrow and the readiness to do penance by a visible, outward sign, the matter of the sacrament. Since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> rejected the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> great care must be bestowed upon the Biblical and patristic <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its existence and its necessity. The required satisfaction, the third act of the penitent, is fulfilled in the penances (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>) which, according to the present custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are imposed by the confessor immediately before the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. The actual fulfillment of such penances is not essential to the validity of the sacrament, but belongs rather to its integrity. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> extra-sacramental remission of punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is called <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. This power of granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, both for the living and the dead, is included in the power of the Keys committed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p>Extreme Unction may be considered as the complement of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, inasmuch as it can take the place of the latter in case sacramental confession is impossible to one who is unconscious and dangerously ill.

<p>While the five <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of which we have treated so far were instituted for the welfare of the individual, the last two <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> and Matrimony, aim rather at the well-being of human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in general. The <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Sacrament of Holy Orders</a> is composed of various grades, of which those of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> are certainly of a sacramental nature, whereas that of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and the four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> are most probably due to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution. The decision depends on whether or not the presentation of the instruments is essential for the validity of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. In the case of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> this presentation indeed occurs, but without the simultaneous <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. The common opinion prevalent today holds that the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, together with the invocation of the Holy Ghost, is the sole <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form of this sacrament. And since this latter obtains only in the case of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, the conclusion is drawn that only the three hierarchical grades or orders confer <em>ex opere operato</em> the sacramental grace, the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a>, and the corresponding powers. The ordinary minister of all orders, even those of a non-sacramental character, is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may delegate an ordinary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to ordain a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>, or ostiarius. Beginning with the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>, which was not raised to the rank of a major order until the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> and the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> are of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p>Three disciplines treat the Sacrament of Matrimony: dogmatic theology, <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, and canon law. Dogmatic theology leads the way, and proves from the sources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not merely the sacramental nature of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>, but also its essential unity and indissolubility. In the case of a consummated marriage between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the marriage bond is absolutely indissoluble; but where there is question of a consummated marriage between <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> the bond may be dissolved if one of the parties is converted to the Faith, and if the other conditions of what is known as the "Pauline Privilege" are fulfilled. The bond of a non-consummated marriage between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may be dissolved in two cases: when one of the parties concerned makes the solemn profession of religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, or when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, for weighty reasons, dissolves such a marriage. Finally, the grounds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power to establish diriment impediments are discussed and thoroughly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.

<p><em>5. Eschatology (De novissimis)</em>

<p>The final treatise of dogmatic theology has to do with the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">four last things</a>. According as we consider either the individual or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in general, there is seen to be a double consummation of all things. For the individual the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">last things</a> are death and the particular judgment, to which corresponds, as his final state and condition, either <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. The consummation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> on doomsday will be preceded by certain indications of the impending disaster, right after which will occur the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> and the general judgment. As for the opinion that there will be a glorious reign of Christ upon earth for a thousand years previous to the final end of all things, suffice it to remark that there is not the slightest foundation for it in revelation, and even a moderate form of Chiliasm must be rejected as untenable.
