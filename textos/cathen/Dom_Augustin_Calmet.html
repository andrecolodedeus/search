<h1>Dom Augustin Calmet</h1>  

<p>Celebrated exegetist; b. at M&eacute;nil-la-Horgne, near Commercy, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 26 Feb., 1672; d. at the abbey of Senones, near <a href="../cathen/13344b.htm">Saint-Di&eacute;</a>, 25 Oct., 1757. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Breuil, and in 1688 joined the same order in the Abbey of St-Mansuy at Toul, where he was admitted to profession 23 Oct. of the following year. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, 17 March, 1696, he was appointed to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Abbey of Moyen-Moutier. Here with the help of his brethren he began to gather the material for his commentary of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, which he completed at M&uuml;nster in Alsace where he was sent in 1704 as sub-prior and professor of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. The first volume appeared in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1707 with the title "Commentaire litt&eacute;ral sur tous les livres de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testament"; the last of the twenty-three quarto volumes, owing to various delays, was published only in 1716. To satisfy the demand for the work a second edition in twenty-six volumes quarto was issued 1714-1720, and a third, enlarged, edition in nine volumes folio 1724-1726. A Latin translation by Mansi was published at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1730-1738, in nine folio volumes, with new editions at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (1756, eight volumes folio) and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (1789, nineteen volumes quarto); another Latin translation by F. Vecelli appeared at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and Frankfort (1730, six volumes folio). This shows how much the commentary was esteemed. But while it was received with high praise, even by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, critics were not wanting, among whom may be mentioned the Oratorian Richard Simon. It cannot be denied that in spite of its merits and great erudition it is in some respects open to criticism. Difficult passages are often passed over lightly, and too frequently different explanations of a text are set down without a hint to the reader as to which is the right or preferable one.

<p>The work inaugurated a new method of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a>, inasmuch as its author very sensibly departed from the general custom of giving an allegorical (mystical) and tropological (moral) interpretation besides the literal, and confined himself to the latter. The most valuable part of the commentary were the introductory prefaces to the several books and 114 learned dissertations on special topics. These he published separately with nineteen new ones in three volumes, under the title "Dissertations qui peuvent servir de prol&eacute;gom&#232;nes &#224; l'Ecriture Sainte" (Paris, 1720). The collection met with such success that two editions were printed at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> in 1722, the title being changed to "Tr&eacute;sors d'antiquit&eacute;s sacr&eacute;es et profanes". It was translated into English (Oxford, 1726), Latin (by <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Lucca, 1729), <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> (Rotterdam, 1728), German (Bremen, 1738,1744, and 1747) and Italian. In the meanwhile he had prepared two other works closely connected with <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a>: (1) "Histoire de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testament et des Juifs" (Paris, 1718), which went through several editions, and was translated into English (London, 1740), German (Augsburg, 1759) and Latin (ib., 1788); (2) "Dictionnaire historique, critique, chronologique, g&eacute;ographiqu e et litt&eacute;ral de la Bible" (Paris, 1720, two vols. folio), a supplement (also folio) was added in 1728. An improved and enlarged edition in four folio volumes was published in 1730, which has several times been reprinted, the last time in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Encyclop&eacute;die th&eacute;ologique", I-IV. It, too, was translated into Latin and the principal <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages. The English translation by D'Oyley and Colson (1732), revised and with additions by Taylor (1795), went through many editions in a larger and compendious form. In his later years Calmet published some further Biblical dissertations in the "Bible de Vence" (1742). Among his other published works may be mentioned: (1) "Histoire universelle sacr&eacute;e et profane, depuis le commencement du monde jusqu'&#224; nos jours" (Strasburg, 1735, quarto), in which he follows the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> enunciated in <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> "Discours sur l'histoire universelle"; (2) "Histoire eccl&eacute;siastique et civile de la Lorraine" (Nancy, 1728), of great value for the history of that province; (3) "Biblioth&#232;que Lorraine" (Nancy, 1751), containing his autobiography (pp. 209-217); (4) "Commentaire litt&eacute;ral historique et moral sur la r&#232;gle de S. Beno&#238;t" (Paris, 1734). Calmet was a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> religious as well as a learned man. In recognition of these qualities he was elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Lay-Saint-Christophe in 1715, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of St-L&eacute;opold at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> in 1719, and of Senones in 1729; he was also twice entrusted with the office of president or superior general of the congregation. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> wished to confer episcopal dignity upon him, but his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> could not be brought to accept the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.
