<h1>Domenichino</h1>  

<p>Properly DOMENICO ZAMPIERI.

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born in Bologna, 21 Oct., 1581; died in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 16 April, 1641. He began his art studies in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/03190d.htm">Calvaert</a>, but being ill-treated there, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, a poor shoemaker, placed him in the Carracci Academy, where <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a> and Albani were also students. Domenichino was a slow, thoughtful, plodding youth whom his companions called the "Ox", a nickname also borne by his master Ludovico. He took the prize for drawing in the Carracci Academy gaining thereby both fame and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Stimulated by success, he studied unremittingly, particularly the expression of the human face, so that Bellori says "he could delineate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>".

<p>His student days over, he first visited <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> to study Correggio, and then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his earliest friend and patron, Cardinal Agucchi, commissioned him to decorate his palace. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he assisted the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a> with their frescoes in the palace of Cardinal Farnese, who became such an admirer of Domenichino that he had him execute many of the pictures in the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Abbey of Grotta Ferrata. Domenichino's best frescoes are in this church. With Guido he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, for Cardinal Borghese, in S. Gregorio; for Cardinal Aldobrandini he executed ten frescoes at Villa Franscati; for <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Cardinal Montalto</a> he decorated S. Andrea della Valle; and for Cardinal Bandini he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> four pictures for S. Silvestro which rank among his best productions.

<p>He immortalized his name by <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> (1614) for the altar of S. Girolamo della Carit&agrave;, the "Communion of St. Jerome", a copy of which, in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, is in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. This is one of the great pictures of the world and was considered second only to <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> "Transfiguration". He received about fifty dollars for it. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> took it to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> but the Allies returned it. Jealousy of Domenichino long accumulating now burst forth, and he was accused of copying his masterpiece from <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Agostino Carracci</a>. Weary of attacks, the artist went to Bologna but later returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Pope Gregory XV</a> made him <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and architect of the Apostolic Camera (pontifical treasury). In 1630 he settled in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and there opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but was harassed, as in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> artists (cabal of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>), who disfigured his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. Mental suffering, perhaps poison, hastened his death. Domenichino, although not a master of great originality and inspiration, was a prominent figure in the Bolognese School. Potent in fresco he also excelled in decorative landscapes; his colour was warm and harmonious, his style simple, his chiaroscuro superbly managed, and his subordinate groups and accessaries well adjusted and of great interest. The most famous masters of the burin engraved his works, which are: "Portrait of Cardinal Agucchi", Uffizi, Florence; "Life of St. Nilus" (fresco) in Grotta Ferrata near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; "Condemnation of Adam and Eve", Louvre, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; "St. George and the Dragon", National Gallery, London; "St. John", Hermitage, St. Petersburg.
