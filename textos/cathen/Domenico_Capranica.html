<h1>Domenico Capranica</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, canonist, and statesman, b. at Capranica near <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina, Italy</a>, in 1400; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 July, 1458. After brilliant studies in canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> at Padua and Bologna, under such teachers as the later Cardinals Giuliano Cesarini and <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, he received the title of Doctor of Both Laws at the age of twenty-one. Soon he became secretary to <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, and Apostolic prothonotary, and in 1423 or 1426 was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/08025b.htm"><em>in petto</em></a> by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, though his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was not published in secret consistory until 1430. He had earned this rapid promotion by various political and military services, notable by his administration of <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a> and Forli and by his successful reduction of rebellious Bologna. In the meantime he had become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, but for some reason did not go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the public ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. Despite his protest, and their previous agreement with <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> that followed the latter's death (1431) refused to recognize Capranica's <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, sustained their decision on the ground that the delivery of the hat and assignment of the title were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the validity of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>. Capranica, having already suffered severe losses at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through the enmity of the Orsini, took refuge first with the Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and later appealed (1432) to the Council of Basle for recognition of his title. This was granted, but to punish him for adhering to the Council <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> deprived him of all honours and dignities, also of all his possessions. Capranica, then served by &AElig;neas Sylvius as secretary, bore himself with moderation and caution, and soon sought a reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at Florence (30 April, 1434), who restored to him his offices and goods, gave him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> Title of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and sent him to the Council at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, with special commission to treat with the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> concerning the reunion of the Churches. He frequently administered important departments of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, always with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and integrity. He executed twelve responsible embassies for the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and was named (1449) Grand Penitentiary and Archpriest of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a>. Capranica was one of the most earnest reformers in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, inaugurated the restoration of primitive fervour among the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and drew up for <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, in 1449, a model plan of a general religious reformation (Pastor, Gesch. d. P&auml;pste, 4th ed. I, 394-96). He was extremely stern and severe in character, and in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office open and free of speech, also quite fearless. He insisted on a personal examination of the votes cast for <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, whose election greatly surprised him, and remonstrated vigorously with <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> for his nepotism, especially in the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of Don Pedro Luis Borgia as Vicar (governor) of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> (Pastor, op. cit., tr. II, 461). While very liberal to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, on the other hand he was austere and rigid towards the worldly <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the city and was wont to freely reproach them. His household was a model for correctness and simplicity of life. Capranica was eminent as a peacemaker, notable at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, where he healed grievous municipal dissensions, and again between the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and King Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and the princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. During the plague of 1456 he remained at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when many others fled. He took a very prominent part in all the negotiations for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the hope of restoring Constantinople to the Pal&aelig;ologi. To posterity he is best known as the founder of the Collegio Capranica (see <a href="../cathen/13131a.htm">ROMAN COLLEGES</a>), which he opened in his own palace (the oldest Roman monument of the early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>) for thirty-one poor scholars, sixteen in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and the liberal arts, and fifteen in canon law. Its constitutions, drawn up by himself (Rome, 1705, 1879), are praised as a model of their kind; the college itself is the oldest of the Roman colleges and therefore rejoices in the peculiar title of "Almo Collegio". In 1460 his brother Cardinal Angelo Capranica erected nearby a special building for the college (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, Die Universit&auml;ten, I, 317 sqq.). He left all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to ecclestiastical uses, saying: "The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gave it to me; I give it back, for I am not its master, but its steward. I should indeed have reaped but little profit from the nights spent in studying <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> if I were to leave to my relatives the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which belong to the poor" (Pastor, op. cit. II, 492) At his death the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> ambassador wrote home that "the wisest, the most perfect, the most learned, and the holiest <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has in our days possessed is gone from us". He added that he was universally considered as the next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (op. cit. II, 494). Pastor himself says that of all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance Age</a> none but <a href="../cathen/01258b.htm">Albergati</a>, Cesarini, and <a href="../cathen/03393c.htm">Carvajal</a> can be compared with him (ibid., 495). He lies buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, near <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>. He wrote an excellent <em>opusculum</em> known as "The Art of Dying Well" printed in 1487. In his life by Catalanus (see below) are some notes on the Council of Basle, and he is said by Mansi (in Moroni) to have written a history of that council, never printed. He also drew up for the instruction of his nephew certain "Rules of Life" that Pastor says reflect his beautiful character.
