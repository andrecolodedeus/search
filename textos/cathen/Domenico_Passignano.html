<h1>Domenico Passignano</h1>  

<p>(known as IL CRESTI, or IL PASSIGNANO, Cresti being his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> name)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born at Passignano, near <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in 1558; died at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1638. Although a Florentine by birth, he belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He appears to have lived for a while at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and afterwards at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, but going to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he accepted the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> traditions which he followed through the rest of his career. Personally, he was a man of charming manners, delightful in conversation. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> knighted him and gave him many commissions, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> added to his honours and emoluments. He returned to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he was greatly beloved and regarded as the chief member of its Academy, although recognized by all his companions as <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> in style and out of sympathy with the Florentine methods. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> with extraordinary facility, and so rapidly as to be nicknamed <em>Passa Ognuno</em>. This name has been regarded as a sort of play upon the name of his birthplace, and one author asserts that the name Passignano was derived from it; but there appears to be no authority for this. According to the custom of the time, the artist would derive his familiar cognomen from his birthplace.

<p>Passignano's drawing was not particularly correct, but his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of composition were ingenious and clever. He regarded Tintoretto's work with very high favour, and many of his own <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> closely resemble those of the great master. But his desire to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> rapidly <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to use his colours so thinly that many of his important works have for this very reason perished. He was responsible for the street decorations in Florence on the occasion of the marriage of the Grand Duke Ferdinand I with Christina of Lorraine, and the frescoes of the church of San Andrea at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were very largely his work. His own portrait is in the Uffizi Gallery at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and the same city contains several of his best works. He is also to be studied in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, London, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.
