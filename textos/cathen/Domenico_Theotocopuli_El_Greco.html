<h1>Domenico Theotocopuli (El Greco)</h1>  

<p>One of the most remarkable Spanish artists, b. in Crete, between 1545 and 1550; d. at Toledo, 7 April, 1614. On 15 Nov., 1570, the miniature-painter <a href="../cathen/04069a.htm">Giulio Clovio</a> wrote to Cardinal N. Farnese, recommending El Greco to his patron, describing him as a Cretan, who was then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and had been a pupil of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>. El Greco, however, derived very little influence from his master, for his works, beyond a certain influence of Bassano, <a href="../cathen/02303a.htm">Baroccio</a>, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese</a>, or Tintoretto, are individual and distinct. El Greco came to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1577. He signed his name in Greek characters, using the Latin form of his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a>, and repeatedly declaring himself as a native of Crete. He appeared before the tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> at Toledo in 1582, as interpreter for one of his compatriots who was accused of being a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moor</a>; he then definitely announced that he had settled in Toledo. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his parentage or early history, nor why he went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; but in time he became typically Spanish, and his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> exhibit all the characteristics of the people amongst whom he resided. From very early days he struck out a definite line for himself, glorying in cold tones with blue, in the use of grey and many varied tones of white, and in impressionistic work which foreshadowed <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in art that were introduced one hundred and fifty years later. His first authenticated portrait is that of his patron and fellow-countryman, <a href="../cathen/04069a.htm">Clovio</a>, now at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; his last, that of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, in the National Gallery. His first important commission in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the reredos of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> of Diego at Toledo. He may have been drawn to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in connexion with the work in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, but he made Toledo his home. The house where he lived is now a museum of his works, saved to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by one of her nobles.

<p>His earliest important work is "El Espolio", which adorns the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in Toledo, but by far his greatest <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is the famous "Burial of the Count of Orgaz" in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Santo Tom&eacute;. The line of portraits in the rear of the burial scene represents with <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> skill almost every phase of the Spanish character, while one or two of the faces in the immediate background have seldom, if ever, been equalled in beauty. It is one of the masterpieces of the world. The influence of El Greco in the world of art was for a long time lost sight of, but it was very real, and very far-reaching. <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a> owed much to him, and, in modern days, Sargent attributes his skill as an artist to a profound study of El Greco's works. El Greco's separate portraits are marvels of discernment; few men have exhibited the complexities of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> emotion with equal success. The largest collection of his works outside of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> belongs to the King of <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, some of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> being at Sinaia, others in <a href="../cathen/03045a.htm">Bukarest</a>. In the National Gallery of London, in the collections of Sir John Sterling-Maxwell, the Countess of Yarborough, and Sir Frederick Cook, in the galleries of <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and in the possession of several eminent French collectors are fine examples of his work. But to study El Greco's work to <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfection</a> one must visit Toledo, Illescas, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, and many of the private collections of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and his extraordinary work will be found worthy of the closest study. He was a man of eccentric habits and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, of tremendous determination, extraordinary reticence, and extreme devoutness. He was a constant attendant at the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, made complete arrangements for his funeral before he died, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Santo Tom&eacute;.
