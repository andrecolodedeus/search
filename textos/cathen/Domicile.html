<h1>Domicile</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>jus domicilii</em>, right of habitation, residence).

<p>The canon law has no independent and original theory of domicile; both the canon law and all modern civil codes borrowed this theory from the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>; the canon law, however, extended and perfected the Roman theory by adding thereto that of quasi-domicile. For centuries <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation contained no special provision in regard to domicile, adapting itself quite unreservedly on this point both to Roman and Barbarian law. It was only in the thirteenth century, after the revival at Bologna of the study of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, that legists and then the canonists, returned to the Roman theory of domicile, introducing it first into the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and then into practice. Not that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had "canonized", so to speak, this particular point of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> more than others, but <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, being more ancient, formed a basis for canon law, which accepted it, at least in so far as it was not at variance with later decrees of pontifical law. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is this that there exists no document in which the theory of domicile has been completely and officially expounded by an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislator.
<h2 id="section1">Roman law</h2>

<p>We must therefore revert to <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, which established domicile as the extension or communication of a pre-existent legal status of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>&mdash;origin (<em>origo, jus originis</em>). In the theory of the Roman lawyers each man belongs to his municipality, to his city, where, as he contributes his share to the expenses and taxes, so he has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the common advantages. Children naturally follow their father's condition and belong likewise to the city, even though born at a distance. Such is the Roman <em>origo,</em> quite akin to what we call nationality, except that the <em>origo</em> relates to the restricted locality of one's birth, and nationality to one's native land. Hence it is birth, the legal birthplace, that determines one's <em>origo,</em> i.e not the actual site of birth but the place where each one should have been born, the municipality to which the father belonged (L. 1. ff. Ad municip.). Let us now suppose a man settled for a long time in a city of which he is not a native. Partly in return for the taxes he pays, and partly to permit him to exercise local civic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, he is granted the <em>status</em> of a real citizen, without loss, however, of his own <em>origo</em> or municipal right. Such, then, is the primitive concept of domicile in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>: the communication to a man, born in one municipality but residing permanently in another, of the civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> normally reserved to citizens who are natives of the locality. To become as one of the latter, the stranger must create for himself a domicile, and it was this that necessarily led jurists to define domicile and the conditions upon which it could be acquired. Hence the celebrated definition of domicile given by the Emperors <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a> (L. 7, G. de incol.): "It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that each one has his domicile in the place where he has established his home and business and has his possessions; a residence which he does not intend to abandon, unless called elsewhere, from which he departs only as a traveller and by returning to which he ceases to be a traveller." The juridical element constitutive of domicile is the intention, the will definitively to settle oneself in a place, this will being <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from the circumstances and especially the conditions of installation. It implies indefinite stability, not perpetuity in the restricted sense of the word, as though one renounced the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to change domicile. Another domicile may at any time be acquired on the same conditions as the first; it is lost when the intention of abandoning it is coupled with the fact of desertion. Since, therefore, domicile conferred the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as <em>origo,</em> its importance became gradually more and more marked.

<p>We can now better understand the words that so often recur in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> and have been adopted by canonists: those who belong to a municipality by right of birth are citizens (<em>cives</em>), though these terms are used almost synonymously by legists and canonists; those who have spent a sufficient time there without, however, acquiring a domicile, are strangers (<em>adven&aelig;</em>), though to them canonists concede a quasi-domicile. Finally, those who make but a passing sojourn there are transients (<em>peregrini;</em> cf. L. 239, de Verb. sign.). To these categories canonists have added one which the Roman <em>origo</em>, being permanent, could not recognize, namely the wanderers (<em>vagi</em>), who have no fixed residence or who, having definitely abandoned one domicile, have not as yet acquired another.
<h2 id="section2">Development of domicile in canon law</h2>

<p>In the troublous times that prevailed after the Barbarian invasions, the domicile of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was lost sight of, and even the word itself disappeared from the juridical language of the time. However, this does not mean that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> inhabiting certain limited districts had wholly ceased to be connected with local authority, whether civil or religious, nor that all acts were regulated exclusively, after the barbarian concept, by a personal code. The material fact of habitation could not, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, be ignored, but it no longer served for a theory of domicile. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">ecclesiastical canons</a> say that each <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (<em>fidelis</em>) should pay his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in the church where he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and that his obsequies should be held wherever he pays his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, etc., but there is no mention of domicile.



<p>The Roman theory was again restored to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by the glossarists of the Bolognese School, expecially by Accursius in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Whether it was because they mistook the real meaning of <em>origo</em> or desired to explain it in a way that suited the customs of their time, they interpreted it as a sort of domicile resulting from one's birthplace, and if one were born there <em>per accidens</em>, from the place of one's father's birth. Except for this inaccuracy, the Roman theory was well expounded. Moreover, according to the favourite principles of their time, the glossarists brought into prominence the double constitutive element of domicile (or, properly speaking, of acquired domicile): the material element (<em>corpus</em>), i.e. habitation, and the juridical or formal element (<em>animus</em>), i.e. the intention to remain in this habitation indefinitely. Although they did not contribute directly to this revival of domicile, canonists nevertheless adopted it and it was definitively admitted in the gloss of "Liber Sextus" (cc. 2 and 3, de sepult.). They applied these rules to the acts of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life: <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, paschal Communion and <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, confession, extreme unction, funerals, interments, then also to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and juridical competency. The actual canonical rules on domicile are about the same.

<p>In the meantime almost the only development of canon law in this matter has been the creation of the quasi-domicile theory, foreign alike to Roman and modern <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. As its name implies, quasi-domicile is closely patterned on domicile and consists in a sojourn in some one place during a sufficient length of time. Not only does it not call for abandonment of the real domicile, but can co-exist with the latter and even suppose the intention of returning thither. It was evident that the ordinary acts of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of a parishioner, could not be confined to permanent residents only; hence the necessity of assimilating to such residents those who sojourn in the place for a certain length of time. The canonists soon concluded that whoever has a quasi-domicile in a place may receive there the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and perform there legitimately all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life without forfeiting any of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the place of his real domicile; he may even thus become subject to the judicial authority of his place of quasi-domicile. The only restrictions are, as we shall see, for ordinations and, to a certain extent, for funerals. For a long time, however, the theory remained vague and undetermined. Authors could scarcely agree as to precisely what was meant by the "sufficient length" of time (<em>non breve tempus</em>) required for quasi-domicile, and they hesitated to pronounce on the various possible reasons for a sojourn and the degree in which they could create presumption of an intention to acquire quasi-domicile. Strictly speaking, the question was really important only in regard to those marriages whose validity depended on the existence of a quasi-domicile in countries where the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> had been published; in this way, as we shall see below, new legislation became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The quasi-domicile theory was not definitively settled until the appearance of the Instruction of the Holy Office addressed to the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 7 June, 1867, in which quasi-domicile is patterned as closely as possible on domicile. Like the latter, it is made up of the double element of fact and right, i.e. of residence and the intention of abiding in it for a sufficient length of time, this time being clearly stated as a period covering more than six months&mdash;<em>per majorem anni partem</em>. As soon as these two conditions coexist, quasi-domicile is acquired and immediately involves the legal use of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and competencies resulting therefrom. (See below for a recent restriction in regard to marriage.) Finally, quasi-domicile is lost by the simultaneous cessation of both its constitutive elements, i.e. by the abandonment of residence without any intention of returning to it. Suffice it to add that in this matter the canon law, yielding to custom, tends easily to adapt itself to the provisions of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, e.g. as regards the legal domicile of minors, wards, and other analogous provisions.
<h2 id="section3">Present law</h2>

<p>From the preceding explanation there results a very important conclusion which throws a strong light on canonical legislation concerning domicile and which we must now set forth. It is this: the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not deal with domicile for its own sake, but rather on account of its consequences; in other words, on account of the personal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> attached thereto. This explains why domicile must meet divers requirements more or less severe according to the case in point, e.g. marriage, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, juridical competency. Keeping therefore in view the legal consequences of domicile and its various forms it may be defined as a stable residence which entails submission to local authority and permits the exercise of acts for which this authority is competent. To this definition the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and their commentators confine themselves, without touching on the legal effects of domicile. As we have already seen, domicile, properly so called, is the place one inhabits indefinitely (<em>locus perpetu&aelig; habitationis</em>), such perpetuity being quite compatible with more or less transitory residence elsewhere. It matters not whether one be the owner or simply the occupant of the house in which one dwells or whether one owns more or less <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in the locality. The place of one's domicile is not the house werein one resides but the territorial district in which the house or home stands. This district is usually the smallest territory possessing a distinct, self-governing organization. All authors agree that, from a civil viewpoint, the municipality is the place of domicile and, canonically considered, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or territorial division replacing it, e.g. mission or station. It is in the municipality that the acts and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of civil life are exercised, and in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> those of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Strictly speaking, one cannot acquire domicile in a ward or hamlet or in any territorial division which does not form a self- governing group. Of course there are certain acts that do not depend, or that no longer depend, on local authority; in this sense, it is possible to speak of domicile in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> when it is question e.g. of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, or of domicile in a province apropos of the competency of a tribunal. But these exceptions are merely apparent; they imply that one has a domicile in some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> within a given diocese. The canon law has never recognized as domicile an unstable residence in different parts of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> without intent to establish oneself in some particular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Canon law (c. 2, de sepult. in VI), like <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> (L. 5, 7, 27, Ad municip.), allows a double domicile, provided there be in both places a morally equal installation; the most ordinary example of this being a winter domicile in the city and a summer domicile in the country.&mdash;There are three kinds of domicile: domicile of origin, domicile of residence or acquired domicile, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or legal domicile. The domicile of origin, a somewhat inexact imitation of the Roman <em>origo,</em> is that assigned to each individual by his place of nativity unless he be accidentally born outside of the place where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> dwells; practically it is the paternal domicile for legitimate and the maternal domicile for <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> children. Again, in reference to the spiritual life, domicile of nativity is the place where adults and abandoned children are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.&mdash;The domicile of residence or acquired domicile is that of one's own choice, the place where one establishes a residence for an indefinite period. It is acquired by the fact of material residence joined to the intention of there remaining as long as one has no reason for settling elsewhere; this intention being manifested either by an express declaration or by circumstances. Once acquired, domicile subsists, despite more or less prolonged absences, until one leaves it with the intention of not returning.&mdash;Finally, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or legal domicile is that imposed by law; for <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> or exiles it is their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> or place of banishment; for a wife it is the domicile of the husband which she retains even after becoming a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; for children under age it is that of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who have authority over them; for wards it is that of their guardians; lastly, for whoever exercises a perpetual charge, e.g. a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, canon, or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, etc., it is the place where he discharges his functions.

<p>Quasi-domicile is of one kind only, namely of residence and choice and cannot be acquired in any other way. It is acquired and lost on the same conditions as domicile itself and is <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> mainly from such reasons as justify a sojourn of at least six months, e.g. the pursuit of studies, or even for an indefinite period, as in the case of domestics. Quasi-domicile is presumed, especially for marriage, after a month's sojourn according to the Constitution "Paucis abhinc" of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, 19 March, 1758; but this presumption yields to contrary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, except however when it is transformed into a presumption <em>juris et de jure,</em> which admits of no contrary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; such is the case for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of 6 May, 1886, granted at the request of the Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1884 (Acts et Decreta, p. cix) and extended to the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 20 May, 1905. This being so, quasi-residents are regarded as subjects of the local authority just as are permanent residents, being therefore parishioners bound by local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and possessing the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as residents, with this difference, that, if they so choose, they may go and use their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in their own domicile. They can, therefore, apply to the local <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as to their own <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not only for those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> administered to every one who presents himself, e.g. <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and penance, but also for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of their children, for first Communion, paschal Communion, <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, and extreme unction. Their nuptials may also be solemnized in his presence and, except when they have chosen to be buried elsewhere, their funerals should take place from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of their quasi-domicile. Finally, the quasi-domicile permits of their legitimate citation before a judge competent for the locality. As regards marriage, the quasi-domicile affected its validity in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> until the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Ne temere" of 2 August, 1907, rendered the competency of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exclusively territorial, so that all marriages contracted in his presence, within his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> territory, are valid; for a licit marriage, however, one of the two <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> must have dwelt within the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for at least a month.

<p>On the other hand those who have neither a domicile nor a quasi-domicile in a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, who are only there as transients (<em>peregrini</em>), are not counted as parishioners; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and they should respect the pastoral <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at least in so far as possible. The restrictions of former times, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, have been greatly lessened and at present no one would dream of obtaining <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> for annual confession, paschal Communion or the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>. Something, however, still remains: for marriage transients must ask the delegation or authorization of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of their domicile (regularly of the bride) if the contracting parties have not already sojourned for a month within the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> where they seek to contract marriage; funerals also belong to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the domicile, i.e. if the interested parties desire to, and can transport to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church the body of the deceased; in any event the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may demand the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> dues known as <em>quarta funeralis</em>. Generally speaking, transients (<em>peregrini</em>) are not subjects of the local <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; they are not held to the observance of local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> except inasmuch as these affect public order, nor do they become subjects of the local judicial authority.

<p>As to the domicile requisite for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> there are special rules formulated by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>, in his Constitution "Speculatores", 4 November, 1694. The candidate for orders depends upon a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, first by reason of his origin, that is to say, of the place where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had a domicile at the time of his son's birth; second by reason of his own acquired domicile. But the conditions which this domicile must satisfy are rather severe: the candidate must have already resided in the diocese for ten years or else have transported most of his movable goods to a house in which he has resided for three years; moreover, in both cases, he must affirm under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> his intention of definitively establishing himself in the diocese. This is a qualified domicile, the conditions of which must not be extended to other cases.
