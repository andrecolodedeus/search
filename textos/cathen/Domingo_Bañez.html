<h1>Domingo Ba&ntilde;ez</h1>  

<p>(Originally and more properly VA&Ntilde;EZ and sometimes, but erroneously, IBA&Ntilde;EZ).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 29 February, 1528, at Medina del Campo, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>; d. there 22 October, 1604. The qualifying <em>Mondragonensis, </em>attached to his name, seems to be a patronymic after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> John Ba&ntilde;ez of Mondragon, Guipuscoa. At fifteen he began to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>. Three years later he took the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> habit at St. Stephen's Convent, and made his profession 3 May, 1547. During a year's review of the liberal arts and later, he had the afterwards distinguished Bartolom&eacute; Medina as a fellow student. Under such professors as Melchior Cano (1548-51), Diego de Chaves (1551), and Pedro Sotomayor (1550-51) he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, laying the foundations of the erudition and acquiring the acumen which later made him eminent as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and an exponent and defender of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. He next began teaching, and under Domingo Soto, as prior and regent, he field various professorships for ten years. He was made master of students, explaining the "Summa" to the younger brethren for five years, and incidentally taking the place, with marked success, of professors who were sick, or who for other reasons were absent from their chairs at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the customary, sometimes competitive, examinations before advancement he is said easily to have carried off all honours. He taught at the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> from 1561 to 1566. About 1567 he was assigned to a chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, the ancient Complutum. It appears that he was at Salamanca again in 1572 and 1573, but during the four scholastic years 1573-71 he was regent of St. Gregory's Dominican College at Valladolid, a house of higher studies where the best students of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> province were prepared for a scholastic career. Elected Prior of Toro, he went instead to Salamanca to compete for the chair of Durandus, left vacant by Medina's promotion to the chief professorship. He occupied this position from 1577 to 1580. After Medina's death (30 December 1580) he appeared again as competitor for the first chair of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The outcome was an academic triumph for Ba&ntilde;ez and he was duly installed in his new position amid the acclamations of professors and students. There he laboured for nearly twenty years. His name acquired extraordinary authority, and the leading <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> referred to him as the <em>proeclarissimum jubar</em>-- "the brightest light" &#151; of their country.

<p>In another way, Ba&ntilde;ez in his prime was rendering memorable service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as director and confessor of St. Teresa (1515-82). Her own words mark him as the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a> who was most relied upon as a guide and helper, both in her interior life and in her heroic work of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> reform. "To the Father Master Fra Dominie Ba&ntilde;ez, who is now in Valladolid as Rector of the College of St. Gregory, I confessed for six years, and, whenever I had occasion to do so, communicated with him by letter. . . . All that is written and told, she communicated to him, who is the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom she has had, and still has, the most frequent communications." (See "Life of St. Teresa of Jesus, by herself", tr. by David Lewis, 3d ed., London, 1904, Relation VII, 448, 450.) Of the first foundation of the reform, St. Joseph's Monastery at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, she wrote that Ba&ntilde;ez alone saved it from the destruction resolved upon in an assembly of civil and religious authorities (op. cit., ch. xxxvi, 336 sqq.). He did not then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, but "from that time forth he was one of her most faithful friends, strict and even severe, as became a wise director who had a great saint for his penitent." He testifies, in the process of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> that he was firm and sharp with her, while she herself was the more desirous of his counsel the more he humbled her, and the less he seemed to esteem her (op. cit., p., xxxvi). He looked for the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in her truthfulness, obedience, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, patience, and charity towards her <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, while he avowed that no one was more incredulous than himself as to her visions and revelations. In this his mastery of the spiritual life was shown to be as scientific as it was wholesome and practical. "It was easy enough to praise the writings of St. Teresa and to admit her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> after her death. Fra Ba&ntilde;ez had no external help in the applause of the many, and he had to judge her book as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> as one of his ordinary penitents. When he wrote, he wrote like a man whose whole life was spent, as he himself tells us, in lecturing and disputing" (ibid.).

<p>As the schoolman, the lecturer, and academic disputant, Ba&ntilde;ez stands forth as a figure of unprecedented distinction in scholastic <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In his time discussion was rife, and disquieting tendencies counter to the beaten paths of Augustine and Thomas manifested themselves. The great controversy, with whose beginnings his name is prominently associated, goes back to a public disputation held early in 1582. Francisco Zumel, of the Order of Mercy, was moderator. Prudentius Montemayor, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, argued that Christ did not die freely, and consequently suffered death without merit, if the Father had given him a command to die. Ba&ntilde;ez asked what the consequences would have been if the Father had given command not only as to the substance of the act of death, but also as to its circumstances. Prudentius responded that in that case there remained neither liberty nor merit. Louis de Leon, an Augustinian, sided with Prudentius and presently the discussion was taken up by the masters in attendance and carried to the kindred subjects of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and justification. Other formal disputations ensued, and strong feeling was manifested. Juan de Santa e Cruz, a <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a>, felt constrained to refer the matter to the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (5 February), and to his deposition he appended sixteen propositions covering the doctrines in controversy. Leon declared that he had only defended the theses for the sake of argument. His chief thought was to prevent them from being qualified as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Notwithstanding these and further admissions, he was forbidden to teach, publicly or privately, the sixteen propositions as reviewed and proscribed.



<p>In 1588, Luis Molina, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> brought out, at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, his celebrated "Concordia liberi arbitrii cum grati&aelig; donis", bearing the <em>censura</em>, or sanction, of a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Bartolomeu Ferreiro, and dedicated to the Inquisitor General of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, Cardinal Albert of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; but a sentiment against its appearance in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was aroused on the ground of its favouring some of the interdicted propositions. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, advised of this, stopped its sale, and requested Ba&ntilde;ez and probably some others to examine it. Three months later, Ba&ntilde;ez gave his opinion that six of the 11 forbidden propositions appeared in the "Concordia".

<p>Molina was asked to defend himself, and his answers to the objections and to some other observations were added as an appendix, with which, sanctioned anew (25 and 30 August, 1589), the work was permitted to circulate. It was regarded as an epoch-making study, and many Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> rallied to its defense. From Valladolid where the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in 1594 held alternate public disputations for and against its teaching on grace, the contention spread over all <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The intervention of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was again sought, and by the authority of this high tribunal the litigants were required to present their respective positions and claims, and a number of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were consulted as to the merits of the strife. The matter was referred however, by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 August 1594, and all dispute was to cease until a decision was rendered. In the meantime, to offset his <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and other critics, Molina brought counter accusations against Ba&ntilde;ez and Zumel. The latter submitted his defense in three parts, all fully endorsed by Ba&ntilde;ez, 7 July 1595. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> position was set forth about the same time by Ba&ntilde;ez and seven of his brethren, each of whom presented a separate answer to the charges. But the presiding officer of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> desired these eight books to be reduced to one, and Ba&ntilde;ez, together with Pedro Herrera and Didacus Alvarez was instructed to do the work. About four months later Alvarez presented their joint product under the title "Apologetica fratrum pr&aelig;dicatorum in provinci&acirc; Hispani&aelig; sacr&aelig; theologi&aelig; professorum, adversus novas quasdam assertiones cujusdam doctoris Ludovici Molin&aelig; nuncupati", published at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 20 November, 1595. It is noteworthy that this work was signed and ratified by twenty-two masters and professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. To it was added a tract on the intrinsic efficacy of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. Nearly two years later, 28 October, 1597, Ba&ntilde;ez resumed the case in a new summary and petitioned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to permit the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to take up their teaching again on the disputed questions. This was the "Libellus supplex Clementi VIII oblatus pro impetrand&acirc; immunitate a lege silentii utrique litigantium parti imposit&acirc;", published at Salamanca. An answer to the "Libellus" was conveyed in a letter of Cardinal Madruzzi, 25 February, 1598, written in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>: "Inform the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a> that His Holiness, moderating the prohibition that was made, grants them the faculty freely to teach and discuss, as they did in the past, the subject-matter <em>de auxiliis divinae gratia, et eorum efficaci&acirc;</em>, conformably to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>; and likewise the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, that they also may teach and discuss the same subject-matter, always holding, however, to sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>". (Serry, Hist. Cong. de Aux., I, XXVI.) This pronouncement practically ended whatever personal participation Ba&ntilde;ez had in the famous controversy.

<p>It has been contended that Ba&ntilde;ez was at least virtually the founder of present-day <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>, especially in so far as it includes the theories of physical premotion, the intrinsic efficacy of grace, and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> irrespective of foreseen merit. To any reader of Ba&ntilde;ez It is evident that he would have met such a declaration with a strenuous denial. Fidelity to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> was his strongest characteristic. "By not so much as a finger-nail's breadth, even in lesser things", he was wont to say, "have I ever departed from the teaching of St. Thomas". He singles out for special animadversion the views in which his professors and associates dissent even lightly from the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>. "In and throughout all things, I determined to follow St. Thomas, as he followed the Fathers", was another of his favourite assurances. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the integrity of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> teaching could brook no <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> novelty, particularly if it claimed the sanction of St. Thomas's name. In the voluminous literature of the De Auxiliis and related controversies, the cardinal tenets of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> are ascribed by its opponents to a varied origin: The <a href="../cathen/13546b.htm">Rev. G. Schneeman, S.J.</a>, (Controversiarum de divin&aelig; grati&aelig; liberique arbitrii Concordi&acirc; initiae progressus, Freiburg im Br., 1881), the Rev. Father De Regnon, S.J. (Ba&ntilde;ez et Molina, Paris, 1883) and the Rev. Father Gaudier, S.J. (in the Revue des Sciences Eccl&eacute;siastiques, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, 1887, p. 153) are probably the foremost modern writers who designate the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> as Bannesians. But against them appears a formidable list of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of repute who were either <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> themselves or authorities for other opinions. Francisco Su&aacute;rez, for instance (Op. omn., XI, ed Vives, Paris, 1886, Opuse., I, Lib. III, De Auxiliis vii), credits Medina with the first intimations of physical premotion and elsewhere (Op. omn., XI, 50; Opusc. I, Lib. I, De Conc.-Dei, xi, n 6) admits that St. Thomas himself once taught it. Toletus* (Comment. in 8 Lib. Aristotelis, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1573, Lib. II, c. iii, q.8) and Pererius (Pref. to Disquisit. Magicarum Lib. VI, I Ed.) considered as <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>, which was the work (1566) of three <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. [For Delrio see Goudin, Philosophia (Civita Vecchia, 1860), IV pt. IV, 392, Disp. 2, q. 3, 2.] The Rev. Victor Frins S.J., gives it as his opinion (S. Thom&aelig; Aq. O.P. doctrina de Cooperatione Dei cum omni natur&acirc; creat&acirc; pr&aelig;sertim liber&acirc;, Responsio ad R.P. Dummermuth O.P., Paris, 1893) that whilst Medina and Pedro Soto (1551) taught physical predetermination, the originator of the theory was Francis Victoria, O.P. (d. 1546). The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> Ferrariensis (1576), Cajetan (1507), and Giovanni Capreolus (d. 1436) are also accredited <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> in the estimation of such authorities as the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Becanus* [Summa Theol. Schol. (Mainz, 1612), De Deo, xviii, no 14] and Azorius [Institut. Moral. (Rome, 160-11), Lib. I, xxi, 7], and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Coimbra (Comment. in 8 libros Phys., Lib. II, q. 13, a. 1). Molina, strangely enough, cites the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a "certain disciple of St. Thomas" &#151; supposedly Ba&ntilde;ez &#151; as differing only in words from the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, instead of agreeing with that of Aquinas [Concordia (Paris 1876), q. 14, a. 13, Disp. 50]. These striking divergences of opinion of which only a few have been cited would seem to indicate that the attempt to father the Thomistie system on Ba&ntilde;ez has failed. [Cf. Defensio Doctrin&aelig; S. Thom&aelig;, A.M. Dummermuth O.P., <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1895, also Card. Zigliara, Summa Phil. (Paris, 1898), II, 525.]

<p>The development of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> terminology in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was mainly due to the exigencies not only of the stand taken against Molina and the forbidden propositions already mentioned, but of the more important defense against the attacks and aberrations of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. The "predetermination" and "predefinition" of Ba&ntilde;ez and his contemporaries, who included others besides <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, emphasized, on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and providence, a priority to, and independence of future free acts, which, in the Catharino-Molinistic theories, seemed to them less clearly to fall under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> causal action. These terms, however, are used by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> himself. (Comment. de divinis nominibus, Lect. iii.) The words "physical premotion" were meant to exclude, first a merely moral impulse and, secondly, a concurrence of the Divine <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, without the latter's subordination to the First Cause. That such terms, far from doing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the teachings of their great leader, are their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> expression, has, of course, been an unvaried tenet of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. One of the presiding officers of the Congregation De Auxiliis, Cardinal Madruzzi, speaking of Ba&ntilde;ez in this connection, said: "His teaching seems to be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from the principles of St. Thomas and to flow wholly from <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, although he differs somewhat in his mode of speaking" (Serry, Hist. Cong. de Aux. appendix, col. 89). It seems but fair to the memory of Ba&ntilde;ez that this opinion should ultimately prevail.

<p>As a writer, Ba&ntilde;ez is clear, direct and vigorous. Occasionally prolix, he is never dull or inane. He treats a subject lengthily only when it is highly important or manifestly useful. His thought is generally lucidity itself in his pithiest scholastic condensations, nor is it less perspicuous when he adopts a freer and more elegant style in behalf of a wider range of readers. Of copious erudition, he was also keen in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and profoundly versed in <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, surpassing, in this respect, the ablest of his contemporaries. He evidenced a broad-minded and progressive spirit in placing, at no little expense, a fully equipped printing establishment in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Stephen, and in employing for its successful operation the best craftsmen that were then to be had. The list of his works is completed as follows: (1) "Scholastica commentaria in Iam partem angelici doctoris D. Thom&aelig; usque ad 64 qu.", fol. Salamanca, 1584; Venice, 1585, 1602; Douai, 1614; (2) "Scholastica commentaria super c&aelig;teras Iae partis qu&aelig;stiones", fol.
