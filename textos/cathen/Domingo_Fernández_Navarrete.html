<h1>Domingo Fern&aacute;ndez Navarrete</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionary and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, born c. 1610 at Pe&ntilde;afiel in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>; died 1689 at <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>. He received the religious habit about 1630 and on completing his studies was offered the chair of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in several <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. He preferred, however, to devoted his life to the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and in 1646 with twenty-seven of his brethren left his native land and proceeding by way of Mexico, arrived in the Phillipine Islands, 23 June, 1648. He taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> University of St. Thomas, Manila. In 1657 with several of his brethren he went to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and, after learning the language, took up missionary labour chiefly in the province of Fo-kien. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which broke out in 1665 brought disaster to the missions. Forbidden to preach, he occupied himself with writing, hoping by this means to spread and confirm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Being hampered too much he went in 1673 as prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> mission to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to lay before the authorities there the question of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> Rites which had reached an acute stage between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on one side and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> on the other (see <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">CHINA</a>). He was highly esteemed by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, who wished to make him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Chinese missions. He refused the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but on his return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1677 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, at the suggestion of Charles II, forced him to accepted the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, where he laboured with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and fidelity till his death. While on the question of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> Rites he was opposed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, sometimes attacking them very severely; in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he entertained the highest regard for them. In his letters to the viceroy and to the king, requesting them to permit the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to establish a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in his residential city, he pays them a glowing tribute.

<p>Among his principal works may be mentioned "Tratados hist&oacute;ricos, pol&iacute;ticos, &eacute;ticos y religiosos de la monarquia de China" (Madrid, 1676); "Catechismus, lingua sinica," 2 vols.; "Pr&aelig;ceptor ethnicus ex optimis quibusque Sinensium libris extractus, et ex eorumdem sententiis concinnatus, lingua sinica."
