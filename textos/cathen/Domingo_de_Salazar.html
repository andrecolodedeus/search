<h1>Domingo de Salazar</h1>  

<p>Born in La Rioja, in the village of La Bastida on the banks of the Ebro, 1512; died in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 4 December, 1594. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Esteban, Salamanca. Sent to Mexico, where he received the degree of Master in Theology, he was appointed to the professor's chair. His <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> was granted and he devoted himself to the conversion of the natives in the Province of Guajaca. He was characterized here by the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for defending the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Indians that he manifested later in an heroic degree in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. Salazar was next transferred to <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, where he passed many years in toil and privation. From Florida he was recalled to Mexico to be <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and vice-provincial of his order. After forty years of missionary life, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> on important business connected with the Mexican mission. Political enemies tried to thwart his work and succeeded in having him thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> when he sought audience of the king. It was then that his presence in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> was brought to the attention of Philip, who proposed his name to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. Salazar was loath to accept the dignity; but his missionary spirit prevailed. As he wrote later: "One of the reasons which made me accept this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was the fact that these Islands are near <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> . . . For a long time I have had the conversion of that kingdom at heart, and with that thought I came to these Islands". He set out for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> via Acapulco, taking with him twenty <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, twelve of whom died before reaching Mexico; of the remainder only one was able to continue the journey to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. Salazar arrived in Manila in 1581. He espoused the cause of the Filipino with a fearlessness that won for him the titles of the "intrepid Salazar", "the <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>". He held a synod of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which was later confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, erected a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, regulated the internal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, and established a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. In his charity to the poor he even pledged his <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> to relieve their necessities. Old age did not lessen his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He was almost eighty when he set out for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to plead in person the cause of the natives with the king. His mission was successful; various abuses were corrected, three new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were created, and Manila was elevated to a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> with Salazar as its first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He died before receiving the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of his appointment and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Santo Tom&aacute;s, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> bears this inscription: "Hic jacet D. Fr. Dominicus de Salazar Ordinis Pr&aelig;dicatorum, Philippinarum Episcopus, doctrina clarus verus religios&aelig; vit&aelig; sectator, suarum ovium piissimus Pastor, pauperum Pater, et ipse vere pauper. Obiit 4 die Decembris anno 1594."
