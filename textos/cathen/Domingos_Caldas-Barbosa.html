<h1>Domingos Caldas-Barbosa</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> poet, born of a white father and a <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> mother at Rio Janeiro in 1740; died in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 9 November, 1800. Trained at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Rio Janeiro, he developed a power of literary improvisation which he indulged at the expense of the Portugese whites and thereby stirred them up against him. His enemies had him forcibly enrolled in a body of troops setting forth for the colony of Sacramento, where he remained until 1762. Returning to Rio Janeiro he soon embarked for <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and there obtained the patronage of two nobles of the Vasconcellos <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the Conde de Pombeiro and the Marquez de Castello Melhor. Taking <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> he received a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">religious benefice</a>, being attached as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Casa da Supplica&ccedil;&aacute;o.

<p>Although he was a mulatto, he obtained entrance into high <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in the Portugese capital, chiefly because he was a clever entertainer who could improvise <em>cantigas</em> and play his own accompaniment on the viol. Hence the somewhat humiliating sobriquet of <em>cantor de viola</em> which was given to him. Well aware that his social status was an uncertain one, he retained his self possession even in the face of the insulting attitude of the poet Bocage and others. With most of the Portugese poets of the time he had pleasant relations, consorting with them in one or another literary academy. His <em>cantigas</em> acquired great popularity, and it is sometimes difficult to single out his compositions from the mass of those claimed by the people as their own. Yet he was not a great genius; he was rather a minor poet of a facile vein, able to express himself simply, and to avoid the bombast and the sensuality so common in his age. His poetical definition of the characteristically Portugese quality of saudades remains famous.
