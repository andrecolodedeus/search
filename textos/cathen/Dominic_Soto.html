<h1>Dominic Soto</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, renowned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, 1494; d. at Salamanca, 15 Nov., 1560. His first studies were made in his native city. He next studied at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a> under <a href="../cathen/14696a.htm">St. Thomas of Villanova</a>, and later went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he obtained his baccalaureate in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Having studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for a time at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he returned to Alcal&aacute; about 1520, and was made professor of Philosophy in the College of San Ildelfonso. In this capacity he distinguished himself by securing a complete triumph of moderate Realism over the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>. Already enjoying a wide reputation as a professor, and apparently destined for higher honours, he was suddenly moved in 1524 to abandon his chair as teacher and join a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. Straightway he made a retreat at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Montserrat, and then sought admission into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a> at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, where he was received and entered upon his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the Convent of St. Paul. The following year (23 July, 1525) he was admitted to profession, and was made at once professor of dialects in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. In 1529 appeared his first work called "Summulae", which in simplicity, precision, and clearness was a decided improvement on the manuals of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> then in use. After teaching in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for seven years, he was called to a chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> on 27 Nov., 1532, and continued to teach there till 1545, when he was chosen by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> imperial <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. During his labours at the council he rendered great service in helping to formulate dogmatic decrees and in solving <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> difficulties. The general of his order, Albertus Casaus, having died just before the opening of the council, it fell to Soto to represent his order during the first four sessions. In the following sessions he represented the newly-elected general, Franciscus Romaeus. It was at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> that Soto wrote and dedicated to the fathers of the council his treatise "De natura et gratia", in which he clearly and ably expounds the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> teaching on <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and grace. When the council was interrupted in 1547, Soto was summoned by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as his confessor and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. He refused the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a> offered him by the emperor, and in 1550 was permitted to return to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Salamanca, where he was elected prior the same year. Two years later he succeeded Melchior Cano in the principal chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, at that time the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> world. In 1556 Soto resigned his professorial chair. Chief among his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works, besides the "Summulae", are: "In dialecticam Aristotelis commentarii" (Salamanca, 1544); "In VIII libros physicorum" (Salamanca, 1545). The following are his best-known <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works: "De natura et gratia libri III (Venice, 1547); "De ratione tegendi et detegendi secretum" (Salamanca, 1541); "De justitia et jure libri X" (Salamanca, 1556); "Comment. in Ep. ad Romanos" (Antwerp, 1550); "In IV sent. libros comment." (Salamanca, 1555-56).
