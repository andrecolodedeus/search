<h1>Dominic of Prussia</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer, born in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 1382; died at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, 1461. According to the account he wrote of himself his first teacher was the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>; later he was a student at the <a href="../cathen/04465a.htm">University of Cracow</a> where he was noted for his intelligence. Falling into bad habits he led a vagabond life until twenty-five years of age, when he reformed through the influence of Adolf of Essen, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a>, near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Dominic now became a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, entering the order in 1409. His monastic life was one of severe <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a>. The spiritual favours he received were numerous, and many visions are ascribed to him. Among the positions he filled were those of master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and vicar of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a>, where he died. As an author Dominic composed seventeen treatises, which have been preserved in various <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. In the "Libri duo experientiarum" he relates the events of his own life; the "Tractatus de Contempu mundi", "Remedium tentationum", "De verae obedientiae", and "Sonus epulantis" he prepared during his solitary repasts. A further work is his "Letters of Direction".

<p>Dominic of Prussia is frequently mentioned in the discussions as to the origin of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, and what has been improperly called "the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>" is ascribed to him. To the one hundred fifty Ave Marias which in those days formed the "Psalter of Mary" he had the thought of adding meditations on the life of Christ and of His Holy Mother. As in his time the Ave Maria terminated with the words; "Fructus ventris tui, Jesus", he joined to each sentence to recall to mind the mystery, such as "quem Angelo nuntiante de Sancto Spiritu concepisti", "quo concepto, in montana ad Elizabeth ivisti", etc. Both Dominic and his friend Adolf sought to spread the use of this form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a> and among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. For these reasons it is held by some authors that the "Psalter" of Dominic was the form, or one of the original forms, from which the present <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> developed.
