<h1>Dominic of the Mother of God</h1>  

<p>(Called in secular life D<font size=-2>OMENICO</font> B<font size=-2>ARBERI</font>)

<p>A member of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist Congregation</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. near <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 22 June, 1792; d. near Reading, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 27 August, 1849. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were peasants and died while Dominic was still a small boy. There were six children, and Dominic, the youngest child, was adopted by his maternal uncle, Bartolomeo Pacelli. As a boy he was employed to take care of sheep, and when he grew older he did farm work. He was taught his letters by a kind <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and learned to read from a country lad of his own age; although he read all the books he could obtain, he had no regular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> until he entered the Congregation of the Passion. He was deeply religious from childhood, felt himself distinctly called to join the institute he entered, and believed that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by a special manifestation, had told him that he was destined to announce the Gospel <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to bring back stray sheep to the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>He was received into the Congregation of the Passion in 1814, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1 March, 1818. After completing the regular course of studies, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to the students of the congregation as <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> for a period of ten years. He then held in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the offices of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, provincial consultor, and provincial, and fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of these positions with ability. At the same time he constantly gave missions and retreats. He founded the first <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Retreat in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> at Ere near Tournai in 1840; in 1842, after twenty-eight years of effort, he established the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, at Aston Hall, Staffordshire. During the seven years of his missionary life in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he established three houses of the congregation. He died at a small railway station near Reading and was buried under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of St. Anne's Retreat, Sutton, St. Helen's. Among the remarkable converts whom he received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be mentioned <a href="../cathen/04604b.htm">John Dobree Dalgairns</a>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> two companions, E. S. Bowles and Richard Stanton, all of whom were afterwards distinguished <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. The reception in 1845 of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and his friends must have been the greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of his life. In 1846 Father Dominic received the <a href="../cathen/14214b.htm">Hon. George Spencer</a>, in religion Father Ignatius of St. Paul, into the Congregation of the Passion.

<p>Among Father Dominic's works are: courses of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>; a volume on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Our Lord</a>; a work for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> on the Sorrows of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, "Divina Paraninfa"; a refutation of <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">de Lamennais</a>; three series of sermons; various controversial and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works. In 1841 he addressed a Latin letter to the professors of Oxford in which he answered the objections and explained the difficulties of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. An English translation of the letter is given in the appendix to the life of Father Dominic by Father Pius Devine.
