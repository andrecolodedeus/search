<h1>Don Isaac Abrabanel</h1>  

<p>(Also: Abravanel, Abarbanel).

<p><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> statesman, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> 1437; died in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1508, <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>. From his early youth, he was carefully instructed in the <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">Talmudic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinic</a> literatures, and mastered the various branches of secular learning. His keen <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and, above all, a great business ability drew to him the attention of Alfonso V of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, who made him his treasurer, a position that he held until 1481. The favour shown by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> prince to a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> shocked the public opinion of those times, and under John II Abrabanel was accused of conspiring with the Duke of Braganza, and barely saved his life by fleeing to <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, 1483. Soon afterwards he entered the service of Ferdinand and <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella</a>, 1484-92. After the fall of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, he shared the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of his race, and was banished from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1492. He repaired to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and, owing to various vicissitudes went successively to <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>, <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a>, <a href="../cathen/10497a.htm">Monopoli</a>, and finally to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Most of Abrabanel's works date from the last years of his life, when, on account of his misfortunes, he found more leisure for collecting and ordering his thoughts. Abrabanel <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, and is often ranked among the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. His philosophy, however, was intended by him simply as a means of defending his religious convictions. He can hardly be said to have written any work professedly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, with the possible exception of a juvenile treatise on the form of the natural elements; his views in this respect must be gathered from his various <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> treatises. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> Abrabanel shows himself a champion of the most rigid Jewish <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and does not hesitate to oppose even <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a> when the latter seems to depart from the traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In the field of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a>, Abrabanel has the merit of having anticipated much of what has been advanced as new by modern investigators, and of having considered systematically not only the letter of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of its authors, their aim and surroundings. Each <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentary</a> is furnished with a preface in which these preliminary questions are treated. His familiarity with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors his acquaintance with court life and customs, a keen sense of his misfortunes, joined with a very extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and a great power of observation, fitted him eminently for the task of a <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> interpreter. We have from him a commentary on <a href="../cathen/04761b.htm">Deuteronomy</a>; on the first four books of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>; on the earlier and on the later <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>. They have been warmly lauded both by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, have passed through several editions, and many of them have been, in whole or in part, translated into Latin. Of his other works we may mention "The Crown of the Ancients", "The Pinnacle of Faith", "The Sources of Salvation", in the form of a commentary on <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a>, "The Salvation of His Anointed" "The Herald of Salvation", in which are collected and explained all the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> texts. His works the titles of which are here rendered in English were written in a clear, refined, but occasionally diffuse modern Hebrew.
