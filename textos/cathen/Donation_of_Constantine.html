<h1>Donation of Constantine</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Donatio Constantini</em>).

<p>By this name is understood, since the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, a forged document of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine the Great</a>, by which large privileges and rich possessions were conferred on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. In the oldest known (ninth century) <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Latin 2777) and in many other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the document bears the title: "Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris". It is addressed by Constantine to Pope Sylvester I (314-35) and consists of two parts. In the first (entitled "Confessio") the emperor relates how he was instructed in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> by Sylvester, makes a full profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and tells of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and how he was thereby cured of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. In the second part (the "Donatio") Constantine is made to confer on Sylvester and his successors the following privileges and possessions: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>, has the primacy over the four Patriarchs of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Constantinople, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, also over all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the world. The <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, built by Constantine, shall surpass all churches as their head, similarly the churches of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a> shall be endowed with rich possessions. The chief Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (<em>clerici cardinales</em>), among whom senators may also be received, shall obtain the same honours and distinctions as the senators. Like the emperor the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> shall have as functionaries <em>cubicularii, ostiarii</em>, and<em> excubitores.</em> The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> shall enjoy the same honorary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as the emperor, among them the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to wear an imperial crown, a purple cloak and tunic, and in general all imperial insignia or signs of distinction; but as Sylvester refused to put on his head a golden crown, the emperor invested him with the high white cap (<em>phrygium</em>). Constantine, the document continues, rendered to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the service of a <em>strator</em>, i.e. he led the horse upon which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> rode. Moreover, the emperor makes a present to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his successors of the Lateran palace, of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the provinces, districts, and towns of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and all the Western regions (<em>tam palatium nostrum, ut prelatum est, quamque Rom&aelig; urbis et omnes Itali&aelig; seu occidentalium regionum provincias loca et civitates</em>). The document goes on to say that for himself the emperor has established in the East a new capital which bears his name, and thither he removes his government, since it is inconvenient that a secular emperor have power where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has established the residence of the head of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. The document concludes with maledictions against all who dare to violate these donations and with the assurance that the emperor has signed them with his own hand and placed them on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Peter.

<p>This document is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, fabricated somewhere between the years 750 and 850. As early as the fifteenth century its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> was known and demonstrated. <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> (De Concordanti&acirc; Catholic&acirc;, III, ii, in the Basle ed. of his Opera, 1565, I) spoke of it as a <em>dictamen apocryphum</em>. Some years later (1440) Lorenzo Valla (De falso credita et ementita Constantini donatione declamatio, Mainz, 1518) <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Independently of both his predecessors, Reginald Pecocke, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> (1450-57), reached a similar conclusion in his work, "The Repressor of over much Blaming of the Clergy", Rolls Series, II, 351-366. Its genuinity was yet occasionally defended, and the document still further used as authentic, until <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> in his "Annales Ecclesiastici" (ad an. 324) admitted that the "Donatio" was a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, whereafter it was soon universally admitted to be such. It is so clearly a fabrication that there is no reason to wonder that, with the revival of historical criticism in the fifteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of the document was at once recognized. The <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> made use of various authorities, which Grauert and others (see below) have thoroughly investigated. The introduction and the conclusion of the document are imitated from authentic writings of the imperial period, but formul&aelig; of other periods are also utilized. In the "Confession" of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> is explained at length, afterwards the Fall of man and the Incarnation of Christ. There are also reminiscences of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/04312a.htm">Iconoclast Synod of Constantinople</a> (754) against the veneration of images. The narrative of the conversion and healing of the emperor is based on the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of Sylvester (Acta or Gesta Sylvestri), yet all the particulars of the "Donatio" narrative do not appear in the hitherto known texts of that legend. The distinctions conferred on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> probably invented and described according to certain contemporary rites and the court ceremonial of the Roman and the Byzantine emperors. The author also used the biographies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, likewise eighth-century letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially in his account of the imperial donations.

<p>The authorship of this document is still wrapped in obscurity. Occasionally, but without sufficient reason, critics have attributed it to the author of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> or to some Roman ecclesiastic of the eighth century. On the other hand, the time and place of its composition have lately been thoroughly studied by numerous investigators (especially Germans), though no sure and universally accepted conclusion has yet been reached. As to the place of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> (Annales, ad. an. 1081) maintained that it was done in the East by a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Greek; it is, indeed, found in Greek canonical collections. Natalis Alexander opposed this view, and it is no longer held by any recent historian. Many of the recent critical students of the document locate its composition at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and attribute the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> to an ecclesiastic, their chief argument being an intrinsic one: this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> document was composed in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, therefore <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself must have had the chief interest in a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> executed for a purpose so clearly expressed. Moreover, the sources of the document are chiefly Roman. Nevertheless, the earlier view of Zaccaria and others that the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> originated in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire has quite recently been ably defended by <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> and Grauert (see below). They call attention to the fact that the "Donatio" appears first in <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> collections, i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> and in the above-mentioned St-Denis <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>; moreover the earliest certain quotation of it is by <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> authors in the second half of the ninth century. Finally, this document was never used in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery until the middle of the eleventh century, nor in general is it referred to in Roman sources until the time of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> (983-1002, i.e. in case the famous "Diploma" of this emperor be authentic). The first certain use of it at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> in 1054, and it is to be noted that this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was by birth and training a German, not an Italian. The writers mentioned have shown that the chief aim of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> was to prove the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the <em>translatio imperii</em> to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, i.e. the transfer of the imperial title at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in 800; the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> was, therefore, important mainly for the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. This view is rightly tenable against the opinion of the majority that this <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> originated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.



<p>A still greater divergency of opinion reigns as to the time of its composition. Some have asserted (more recently Martens, Friedrich, and Bayet) that each of its two parts was fabricated at different times. Martens holds that the author executed his <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> at brief intervals; that the "Constitutum" originated after 800 in connection with a letter of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> (778) to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> wherein the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> acknowledged the imperial position to which the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king by his own efforts and fortune had attained. Friedrich (see below), on the contrary, attempts to prove that the "Constitutum" was composed of two really distinct parts. The gist of the first part, the so-called "Confessio", appeared between 638 and 653, probably 638-641, while the second, or "Donatio" proper, was written in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a>, between 752 and 757, by Paul, brother and successor of Pope Stephen. According to Bayet the first part of the document was composed in the time of <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> (757-767); the latter part appeared in or about the year 774. In opposition to these opinions most historians maintain that the document was written at the same time and wholly by one author. But when was it written? Colombier decides for the reign of <a href="../cathen/04258a.htm">Pope Conon</a> (686-687), Genelin for the beginning of the eighth century (before 728). But neither of these views is supported by sufficient reasons, and both are certainly untenable. Most investigators accept as the earliest possible date the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> (752-757), thus establishing a connection between the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> and the historical events that led to the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> and the Western Empire of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings. But in what year of period from the above-mentioned pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> until the reception of the "Constitutum" in the collection of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> (c. 840-50) was the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> executed? Nearly every student of this intricate question maintains his own distinct view. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> first to answer a preliminary question: Did <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> in his letter to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> of the year 778 (Codex Carolinus, ed. Jaff&eacute; Ep. lxi) exhibit a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the "Constitutum"? From a passage of this letter (Sicut temporibus beati Silvestri Romani pontificis a sanct&aelig; recordationis piissimo Constantino magno imperatore per eius largitatem sancta Dei Catholica et Apostolica Romana ecclesia elevata et exaltata est et potestatem in his Hesperi&aelig; partibus largiri dignatus, ita et in his vestris felicissimis temporibus atque nostris sancta Dei ecclesia, id est beati Petri apostoli, germinet atque exultet. . . .) several writers, e.g. <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, Langen, Meyer, and others have concluded that <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> was then aware of this <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, so that it must have appeared before 778. Friedrich assumes in <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the "Constitutum" from his letter to Emperor Constantine VI written in 785 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Concil. Coll., XII, 1056). Most historians, however, rightly refrain from asserting that <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> made use of this document; from his letters, therefore, the time of its origin cannot be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a>.

<p>Most of the recent writers on the subject assume the origin of the "Donatio" between 752 and 795. Among them, some decide for the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> (752-757) on the hypothesis that the author of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> wished to substantiate thereby the claims of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his negotiations with Pepin (<a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, Hauck, Friedrich, B&ouml;hmer). Others lower the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> to the time of <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> (757-767), and base their opinion on the political events in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or on the fact that he had a special veneration for St. Sylvester, and that the "Donatio" had especially in view the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this saint (Scheffer-Boichorst, Mayer). Others again locate its origin in the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> (772-795), on the hypothesis that this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> hoped thereby to extend the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> over a great part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and to create in this way a powerful <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> State under <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> government (Langen, Loening). A smaller group of writers, however, remove the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> to some date after 800, i.e. after the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> as emperor. Among these, Martens and Weiland assign the document to the last years of the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, or the first years of Louis the Pious, i.e. somewhere between 800 and 840. They argue that the chief purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> was to bestow on the Western ruler the imperial power, or that the "Constitutum" was meant to indicate what the new emperor, as successor of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, might have conferred on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Those writers also who seek the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire maintain that the document was written in the ninth century, e.g. especially <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> and Grauert. The latter opines that the "Constitutum" originated in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Denis, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, shortly before or about the same time as the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a>, i.e. between 840 and 850.

<p>Closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> is the other question concerning the primary purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> of the "Donatio". Here, too, there exists a great variety of opinions. Most of the writers who locate at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself the origin of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> maintain that it was intended principally to support the claims of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; they differ, however, as to the extent of the said claims. According to <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> the "Constitutum" was destined to aid in the creation of a united <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> government. Others would limit the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims to those districts which <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> sought to obtain from Pepin, or to isolated territories which, then or later, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> desired to acquire. In general, this class of historians seeks to connect the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> with the historical events and political movements of that time in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Mayer, Langen, Friedrich, Loening, and others). Several of these writers lay more stress on the elevation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> than on the donation of territories. Occasionally it is maintained that the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> sought to secure for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a kind of higher <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, something akin to imperial supremacy as against the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Government, then solidly established in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Again, some of this class limit to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the expression <em>occidentalium regionum provincias</em>, but most of them understand it to mean the whole former Western Empire. This is the attitude of Weiland, for whom the chief object of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> is the increase of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power over the imperial, and the establishment of a kind of imperial supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over the whole West. For this reason also he lowers the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the "Constitutum" no further than the end of the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (814). As a matter of fact, however, in this document Sylvester does indeed obtain from Constantine imperial rank and the emblems of imperial dignity, but not the real imperial supremacy. Martens therefore sees in the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> an effort to elevate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in general; all alleged prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and of Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, all gifts of landed possessions, and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of secular government are meant to promote and confirm this elevation, and from it all the new <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Emperor Charlemagne</a> ought to draw practical conclusions for his behaviour in relation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Scheffer-Boichorst holds a singular opinion, namely that the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> intended primarily the glorification of Sylvester and Constantine, and only in a secondary way a defence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims to territorial possessions. Grauert, for whom the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> subject, shares the view of <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> had in mind a defence of the new Western Empire from the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>. Therefore it was highly important for him to establish the legitimacy of the newly founded empire, and this purpose was especially aided by all that the document alleges concerning the elevation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. From the foregoing it will be seen that the last word of historical research in this matter still remains to be said. Important questions concerning the sources of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, the place and time of its origin, the tendency of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a>, yet await their solution. New researches will probably pay still greater attention to textual criticism, especially that of the first part or "Confession" of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>As far as the evidence at hand permits us to judge, the forged "Constitutum" was first made known in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. The oldest extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of it, certainly from the ninth century, was written in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. In the second half of that century the document is expressly mentioned by three <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> writers. Ado, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, speaks of it in his Chronicle (De sex &aelig;tatibus mundi, ad an. 306, in P.L., CXXIII, 92); &AElig;neas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, refers to it in defence of the Roman primacy (Adversus Gr&aelig;cos, c. ccix, op. cit., CXXI, 758); <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims</a>, mentions the donation of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> according to the "Constitutum" (De ordine palatii, c. xiii, op. cit., CXXV, 998). The document obtained wider circulation by its incorporation with the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> (840-850, or more specifically between 847 and 852; Hinschius, Decretales Pseudo-Isidorian&aelig;, Leipzig, 1863, p. 249). At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> no use was made of the document during the ninth and the tenth centuries, not even amid the conflicts and difficulties of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> with Constantinople, when it might have served as a welcome argument for the claims of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who used it in an official act and relied upon, was <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>; in a letter of 1054 to <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, he cites the "Donatio" to show that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> possessed both an earthly and a heavenly <em>imperium</em>, the royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Thenceforth the "Donatio" acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political conflicts between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. <a href="../cathen/01550d.htm">Anselm of Lucca</a> and Cardinal Deusdedit inserted it in their collections of canons. Gratian, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, excluded it from his "Decretum", but it was soon added to it as "Palea". The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers in defence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> during the conflicts of the early part of the twelfth century quoted it as authoritative (Hugo of Fleury, De regi&acirc; potestate et ecclesiastic&acirc; dignitate, II; Placidus of Nonantula, De honore ecclesi&aelig;, cc. lvii, xci, cli; Disputatio vel defensio Paschalis pap&aelig;, Honorius Augustodunensis, De summ&acirc; glori&aelig;, c. xvii; cf. Mon. Germ. Hist., Libelli de lite, II, 456, 591, 614, 635; III, 71). <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> also relied on it in his writings against the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalous of Parma</a> (Disceptatio synodalis, in Libelli de lite, I, 88). <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> himself never quoted this document in his long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberty against the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> made use of it in 1091 to support his claims on the island of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. Later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>) took its authority for granted (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, Sermo de sancto Silvestro, in P.L., CCXVII, 481 sqq.; Raynaldus, Annales, ad an. 1236, n. 24; Potthast, Regesta, no. 11,848), and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers often adduced its evidence in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, on the other hand, never denied the validity of this appeal to the pretended donation of Constantine, but endeavoured to show that the legal deductions drawn from it were founded on <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretations. The authenticity of the document, as already stated, was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by no one before the fifteenth century. It was known to the Greeks in the second half of the twelfth century, when it appears in the collection of <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Theodore Balsamon</a> (1169 sqq.); later on another Greek canonist, <a href="../cathen/02596a.htm">Matth&aelig;us Blastares</a> (about 1335), admitted it into his collection. It appears also in other Greek works. Moreover, it was highly esteemed in the Greek East. The Greeks claimed, it is well known, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Rome (Constantinople) the same honorary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as those enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. By now, by virtue of this document, they claimed for the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> also the privileges and perogatives granted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. In the West, long after its authenticity was disputed in the fifteenth century, its validity was still upheld by the majority of canonists and jurists who continued throughout the sixteenth century to quote it as authentic. And though <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and later historians acknowledged it to be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, they endeavoured to marshal other authorities in defence of its content, especially as regards the imperial donations. In later times even this was abandoned, so that now the whole "Constitutum", both in form and content, is rightly considered in all senses a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>.
