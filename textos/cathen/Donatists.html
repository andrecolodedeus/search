<h1>Donatists</h1>  

<p>The Donatist schism in Africa began in 311 and flourished just one hundred years, until the conference at Carthage in 411, after which its importance waned.
<h2>Causes of the schism</h2>

<p>In order to trace the origin of the division we have to go back to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. The first edict of that emperor against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (24 Feb., 303) commanded their churches to be destroyed, their Sacred Books to be delivered up and burnt, while they themselves were outlawed. Severer measures followed in 304, when the fourth edict ordered all to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the idols under pain of death. After the abdication of <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> in 305, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> seems to have abated in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Until then it was terrible. In Numidia the governor, Florus, was <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> for his cruelty, and, though many officials may have been, like the proconsul Anulinus, unwilling to go further than they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> is able to say of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the whole country that some were confessors, some were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, some fell, only those who were hidden escaped. The exaggerations of the highly strung African character showed themselves. A hundred years earlier <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had taught that flight from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was not permissible. Some now went beyond this, and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> gave themselves up to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Their motives were, however, not always above suspicion. Mensurius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in a letter to Secundus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tigisi, then the senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>) of Numidia, declares that he had forbidden any to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who had given themselves up of their own accord, or who had boasted that they possessed copies of the Scriptures which they would not relinquish; some of these, he says, were criminals and debtors to the State, who thought they might by this means rid themselves of a burdensome life, or else wipe away the remembrance of their misdeeds, or at least gain money and enjoy in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> the luxuries supplied by the kindness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The later excesses of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> show that Mensurius had some ground for the severe line he took. He explains that he had himself taken the Sacred Books of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to his own house, and had substituted a number of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> writings, which the prosecutors had seized without asking for more; the proconsul, when informed of the deception refused to search the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> private house. Secundus, in his reply, without blaming Mensurius, somewhat pointedly praised the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who in his own province had been tortured and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for refusing to deliver up the Scriptures; he himself had replied to the officials who came to search: "I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, not a <em>traditor</em>." This word <em>traditor</em> became a technical expression to designate those who had given up the Sacred Books, and also those who had committed the worse crimes of delivering up the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and even their own brethren.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that relations were strained between the confessors in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Carthage and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If we may credit the Donatist Acts of the forty-nine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Abitene, they broke off communion with Mensurius. We are informed in these Acts that Mensurius was a traditor by his own confession, and that his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Caecilian, raged more furiously against the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> than did the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> themselves; he set armed men with whips before the door of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to prevent their receiving any succor; the food brought by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was thrown to the dogs by these ruffians, and the drink provided was spilled in the street, so that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whose condemnation the mild proconsul had deferred, died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of hunger and thirst. The story is recognized by Duchesne and others as exaggerated. It would be better to say that the main point is incredible; the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> would not have been allowed by the Roman officials to starve; the details &#151; that Mensurius confessed himself a traditor, that he prevented the succoring of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> confessors &#151; are simply founded on the letter of Mensurius to Secundus. Thus we may safely reject all the latter part of the Acts as fictitious. The earlier part is authentic: it relates how certain of the faithful of Abitene met and celebrated their usual Sunday service, in defiance of the emperor's edict, under the leadership of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Saturninus, for their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was a traditor and they disowned him; they were sent to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, made bold replies when interrogated, and were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Anulinus, who might have condemned them to death forthwith. The whole account is characteristic of the fervid African temperament. We can well imagine how the prudent Mensurius and his lieutenant, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Caecilian, were disliked by some of the more excitable among their flock.

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in detail how the inquiries for sacred books were carried out, for the official minutes of an investigation at <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> (afterwards Constantine) in Numidia are preserved. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> showed themselves ready to give up all they had, but drew the line at betraying their brethren; even here their generosity was not remarkable, for they added that the names and addresses were well known to the officials. The examination was conducted by Munatius Felix, perpetual flamen, curator of the colony of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a>. Having arrived with his satellites at the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house &#151; in Numidia the searching was more severe than in Proconsular Africa &#151; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was found with four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, four <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and several <em>fossores</em> (diggers). These declared that the Scriptures were not there, but in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>; and in fact the bookcase was found to be empty. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> present refused to give the names of the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, saying they were known to the notaries; but, with the exception of the books, they gave in an inventory of all possessions of the church: two golden <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, six of silver, six silver <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruets</a>, a silver bowl, seven silver lamps, two candlesticks, seven short bronze lamp-stands with lamps, eleven bronze lamps with chains, eighty-two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> tunics, twenty-eight veils, sixteen men's tunics, thirteen pairs of men's boots, forty-seven pairs of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> boots, nineteen countrymen's smocks. Presently the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Silvanus brought forth a silver box and another silver lamp, which he had found behind a jug. In the dining-room were four casks and seven jugs. A <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> produced a thick book. Then the houses of the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> were visited: Eugenius gave up four volumes, Felix, the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> worker gave up five, Victorinus eight, Projectus five large volumes and two small ones, the grammarian Victor two <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> and five quinions, or gatherings of five leaves; Euticius of Caesarea declared that he had no books; the wife of Coddeo produced six volumes, and said that she had no more; and a search was made without further result. It is interesting to note that the books were all <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> (in book form), not rolls, which had gone out of fashion in the course of the preceding century.



<p>It is to be hoped that such disgraceful scenes were infrequent. A contrasting instance of heroism is found in the story of Felix, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tibiuca, who was hauled before the magistrate on the very day, 5 June 303, when the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was posted up in that city. He refused to give up any books, and was sent to Carthage. The proconsul Anulinus, unable by close confinement to weaken his determination, sent him on to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian Hercules</a>.

<p>In 305, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had relaxed, and it was possible to unite fourteen or more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> in order to give a successor to Paul. Secundus presided as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, and in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he attempted to examine the conduct of his colleagues. They met in a private house, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had not yet been restored to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. "We must first try ourselves", said the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, "before we can venture to ordain a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>". To Donatus of Mascula he said: "You are said to have been a traditor." "You know", replied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "how Florus searched for me that I might offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not deliver me into his hands, brother. As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forgave me, do you reserve me to His judgment." "What then", said Secundus, "shall we say of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>? It is because they did not give up anything that they were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>." "Send me to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," said Donatus, "to Him will I give an account." (In fact, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not amenable to penance and was properly "reserved to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" in this sense.) "Stand on one side", said the president, and to Marinus of Aquae Tibilitanae he said: "You also are said to be a traditor." Marinus said: "I gave papers to Pollux; my books are safe." This was not satisfactory, and Secundus said: "Go over to that side"; then to Donatus of <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a>: "You are said to be a traditor." "I gave up books on medicine." Secundus seems to have been incredulous, or at least he thought a trial was needed, for again he said: "Stand on one side." After a gap in the Acts, we read that Secundus turned to Victor, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Russicade: "You are said to have given up the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>." Victor replied: "It was the curator, Valentinus; he forced me to throw them into the fire. Forgive me this fault, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will also forgive it." Secundus said: "Stand on one side." Secundus (after another gap) said to Purpurius of Limata: "You are said to have killed the two sons of your sister at Mileum" (Milevis). Purpurius answered with vehemence: "Do you think I am frightened by you as the others are? What did you do yourself when the curator and his officials tried to make you give up the Scriptures? How did you manage to get off scot-free, unless you gave them something, or ordered something to be given? They certainly did not let you go for nothing! As for me I have killed and I kill those who are against me; do not provoke me to say anymore. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I do not interfere where I have no business." At this outburst, a nephew of Secundus said to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>: "You hear what they say of you? He is ready to withdraw and make a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all those whom you accuse; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> they are capable of turning you out and condemning you, and you alone will then be the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. What is it to you what they have done? Each must give his account to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Secundus (as St. Augustine points out) had apparently no reply against the accusation of Purpurius, so he turned to the two or three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who remained unaccused: "What do you think?" These answered: "They have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to whom they must give an account." Secundus said: "You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows. Sit down." And all replied: <em>Deo gratis</em>.

<p>These minutes have been preserved for us by St. Augustine. The later Donatists declared them forged, but not only could <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> refer to the age of the parchment on which they were written, but they are made easily credible by the testimonies given before Zenophilus in 320. Seeck, as well as Duchesne (see below), upholds their genuineness. We hear from <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> of another fallen Numidian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who refused to come to the council on the pretext of bad eyes, but in reality for fear his fellow-citizens should prove that he had offered <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, a crime of which the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not guilty. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> proceeded to ordain a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and they chose Silvanus, who, as a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, assisted in the search for <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>. The people of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> rose up against him, crying that he was a traditor, and demanded the appointment of a certain Donatus. But country people and gladiators were engaged to set him in the episcopal chair, to which he was carried on the back of a man named Mutus.
<h2>Caecilian and Majorinus</h2>

<p>A certain Donatus of Casae Nigrae is said to have caused a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in Carthage during the lifetime of Mensurius. In 311 <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> obtained dominion over Africa, and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Carthage, Felix, was accused of writing a defamatory letter against the tyrant. Mensurius was said to have concealed his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in his house and was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was acquitted, but died on his return journey. Before his departure from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, he had given the gold and silver ornaments of the church to the care of certain old men, and had also consigned an inventory of these effects to an aged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who was to deliver it to the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> gave liberty to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so that it was possible for an election to be held at Carthage. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Carthage, like the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was commonly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, assisted by a number of others form the vicinity. He was <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> not only of the proconsular province, but of the other provinces of North Africa, including Numidian, Byzacene, Tripolitana, and the two Mauretanias, which were all governed by the vicar of prefects. In each of these provinces the local primacy was attached to no town, but was held by the senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, until <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> made the office elective. <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> implies that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Numidia, many of whom were at no great distance from Carthage, had expected that they would have a voice in the election; but two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Botrus and Caelestius, who each expected to be elected, had managed that only a small number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be present. Caecilian, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who had been so obnoxious to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, was duly chosen by the whole people, placed in the chair of Mensurius, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Felix, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aptonga or Abtughi. The old men who had charge of the treasure of the church were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give it up; they joined with Botrus and Caelestius in refusing to acknowledge the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. They were assisted by a rich lady named Lucilla, who had a grudge against Caecilian because he had rebuked her habit of <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the bone of an uncanonized (<em>non vindicatus</em>) <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> immediately before receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. Probably we have here again a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> whose death was due to his own ill-regulated fervour.

<p>Secundus, as the nearest <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, came with his suffragans to Carthage to judge the affair, and in a great council of seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> declared the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of Caecilian to be invalid, as having been performed by a traditor. A new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Majorinus, who belonged to the household of Lucilla and had been a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> in the deaconry of Caecilian. That lady provided the sum of 400 <em>folles</em> (more than 11,000 dollars), nominally for the poor; but all of it went into the pockets of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, one-quarter of the sum being seized by Purpurius of Limata. Caecilian had possession of the basilica and the cathedra of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and the people were with him, so that he refused to appear before the council. "If I am not properly consecrated", he said ironically, "let them treat me as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and lay hands on me afresh, and not on another." On this reply being brought, Purpurius cried: "Let him come here, and instead of laying on him, we will break his head in penance." No wonder that the action of this council, which sent letters throughout Africa, had a great influence. But at Carthage it was well known that Caecilian was the choice of the people, and it was not believed that Felix of Aptonga had given up the Sacred Books. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had given Caecilian their communion. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the moderate Mensurius did not hold that <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by a traditor was invalid, or even that it was illicit, if the traditor was still in lawful possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The council of Secundus, on the contrary, declared that a traditor could not act as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that any who were in communion with traditors were cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They called themselves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and declared that all who were in communion with <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">public sinners</a> like Caecilian and Felix were necessarily <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>.
<h2>The condemnation by Pope Melchiades</h2>

<p>Very soon there were many cities having two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the one in communion with Caecilian, the other with Majorinus. Constantine, after defeating <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> (28 October, 312) and becoming master of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, showed himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in his acts. He wrote to Anulinus, proconsul of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> (was he same as the mild proconsul of 303?), restoring the churches to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and exempting <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the "Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which Caecilian is president" from civil functions (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.5.15</a> and <a href="../fathers/250110.htm">X.7.2</a>). he also wrote to Caecilian (ibid., X, vi, 1) sending him an order for 3000 <em>folles</em> to be distributed in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, Numidia, and Mauretania; if more was needed, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must apply for more. He added that he had heard of turbulent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who sought to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; he had ordered the proconsul Anulinus, and the vicar of prefects to restrain them, and Caecilian was to appeal to these officials if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The opposing party lost no time. A few days after the publication of these letters, their delegates, accompanied by a mob, brought to Anulinus two bundles of documents, containing the complaints of their party against Caecilian, to be forwarded to the emperor. <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> has preserved a few words from their petition, in which Constantine is begged to grant judges from Gaul, where under his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> rule there had been no <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and therefore no traditors. Constantine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> constitution too well to comply and thereby make Gallic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> judges of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> of Africa. He at once referred the matter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, expressing his intention, laudable, if too sanguine, of allowing no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. That the African schismatics might have no ground of complaint, he ordered three of the chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul, Reticius of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, Maternus of Cologne, and Marinus of Arles, to repair to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to assist at the trial. He ordered Caecilian to come thither with ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his accusers and ten of his own communion. The memorials against Caecilian he sent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he says, what procedure to employ in order to conclude the whole matter with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.5.18</a>). <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Melchiades</a> summoned fifteen <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sit with him. From this time forward we find that in all important matters the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> issue their <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal letters</a> from a small council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and there are traces of this custom even before this. The ten Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (for we may now give the party its eventual name) were headed by a Bishop Donatus of Casae Nigrae. It was assumed by Optatus, Augustine, and the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologists that this was "Donatus the Great", the successor of Majorinus as <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. But the Donatists of St. Augustine's time were anxious to deny this, as they did not wish to admit that their protagonist had been condemned, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at the conference of 411 granted them the existence of a Donatus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Casae Nigrae, who had distinguished himself by active hostility to Caecilian. Modern authorities agree in accepting this view. But it seems inconceivable that, if Majorinus was still alive, he should not have been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It would be very strange, further, that a Donatus of Casae Nigrae should appear as the leader of the party, without any explanation, unless Casae Nigrae was simply the birthplace of Donatus the Great. If we assume that Majorinus had died and had been succeeded by Donatus the Great just before the trial at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, we shall understand why Majorinus is never again mentioned. The accusations against Caecilian in the memorial were disregarded, as being anonymous and unproved. The witnesses brought from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> acknowledged that they had nothing against him. Donatus, on the other hand, was convicted by his own confession of having rebaptized and of having laid his hands in penance on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; this was forbidden by ecclesiastical law. On the third day the unanimous sentence was pronounced by <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Melchiades</a>: Caecilian was to be maintained in ecclestiastical communion. If Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in a place where there were two rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the junior was to retire and be provided with another see. The Donatists were furious. A hundred years later their successor declared that <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Melchiades</a> was himself a traditor, and that on this account they had not accepted his decision; though there is no trace of this having been alleged at the time. But the nineteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were contrasted with the seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Cathaginian Council, and a fresh judgment was demanded.
<h2>The Council of Arles</h2>

<p>Constantine was angry, but he saw that the party was powerful in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and he summoned a council of the whole West (that is, of the whole of his actual dominions) to meet at Arles on 1 August, 314. <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Melchiades</a> was dead, and his successor, St. Sylvester, thought it unbecoming to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, thus setting an example which he repeated in the case of Nicaea, and which his successors followed in the cases of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, and the Eastern oecumenical councils. Between forty and fifty sees were represented at the council by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or proxies; the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and Lincoln were there. St. Sylvester sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. The council condemned the Donatists and drew up a number of canons; it reported its proceedings in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which is extant; but, as in the case of Nicaea, no detailed Acts remain, nor are any such mentioned by the ancients. The Fathers in their letter salute Sylvester, saying that he had rightly decided not to quit the spot "where the Apostles daily sit in judgment"; had he been with them, they might perhaps have dealt more severely with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Among the canons, one forbids rebaptism (which was still practised in Africa), another declares that those who falsely accuse their brethren shall have communion only at the hour of death. On the other hand, traditors are to be refused communion, but only when their fault has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by public official acts; those whom they have <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> are to retain their positions. The council produced some effect in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, but the main body of the Donatists was immovable. They appealed from the council to the emperor. Constantine was horrified: "O insolent madness!" he wrote, "they appeal from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to earth, from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to a man."
<h2>The policy of Constantine</h2>

<p>The emperor retained the Donatist envoys in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, after at first dismissing them. He seems to have thought of sending for Caecilian, then of granting a full examination in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The case of Felix of Aptonga was in fact examined by his order at Carthage in February, 315 (St. Augustine is probably wrong in giving 314). The minutes of the proceedings have come down to us in a mutilated state; they are referred to by <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, who appended them to his book with other documents, and they are frequently cited by St. Augustine. It was shown that the letter which the Donatists put forward as proving the crime of Felix, had been interpolated by a certain Ingentius; this was established by the confession of Ingentius, as well as by the witness of Alfius, the writer of the letter. It was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Felix was actually absent at the time the search for Sacred Books was made at Aptonga. Constantine eventually summoned Caecilian and his opponents to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but Caecilian, for some unknown reason, did not appear. Caecilian and Donatus the Great (who was now, at all events, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) were called to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where Constantine heard both sides with great care. He declared that Caecilian was innocent and an excellent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Augustine, Contra Cresconium, III lxxi). He retained both in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, however, while he sent two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Eunomius and Olympius, to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, with an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of putting Donatus and Caecilian aside, and substituting a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to be agreed upon by all parties. It is to be presumed that Caecilian and Donatus had assented to this course; but the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the sectaries made it impossible to carry it out. Eunomius and Olympius declared at Carthage that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was that which is diffused throughout the world and that the sentence pronounced against the Donatists could not be annulled. They communicated with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Caecilian and returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Donatus went back to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and Caecilian, seeing this, felt himself free to do the same. Finally Constantine ordered that the churches which the Donatists had taken should be given to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Their other meeting-places were confiscated. Those who were convicted (of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>?) lost their goods. Evictions were carried out by the military. An ancient sermon on the passion of the Donatist "martyrs", Donatus and Advocatus, describes such scenes. In one of them a regular massacre occurred, and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was among the slain, if we may trust this curious document. The Donatists were proud of this "persecution of Caecilian", which "the Pure" suffered at the hands of the "Church of the Traditors". The <em>Comes</em> Leontius and the <em>Dux</em> Ursacius were the special objects of their indignation.

<p>In 320 came revelations unpleasant to the "Pure". Nundinarius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a>, had a quarrel with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Silvanus, who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be stoned &#151; so he said in his complaint to certain Numidian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in which he threatened that if they did not use their influence in his behalf with Silvanus, he would tell what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of them. As he got no satisfaction he brought the matter before Zenophilus, the consular of Numidia. The minutes have come to us in a fragmentary form in the appendix of Optatus, under the title of "Gesta apud Zenophilum". Nundinarius produced letters from Purpurius and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to Silvanus and to the people of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a>, trying to have peace made with the inconvenient <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. The minutes of the search at <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a>, which we have already cited, were read and witnesses were called to establish their accuracy, including two of the <em>fossores</em> then present and a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, Victor the grammarian. It was shown no only that Silvanus was a traditor, but that he had assisted Purpurius, together with two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in the theft of certain casks of vinegar belonging to the treasury, which were in the temple of Serapis. Silvanus had <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the sum of 20 <em>folles</em> (500 to 600 dollars). It was established that none of the money given by Lucilla had reached the poor for whom it was ostensibly given. Thus Silvanus, one of the mainstays of the "Pure" Church, which declared that to communicate with any traditor was to be outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was himself proved to be a traditor. He was exiled by the consular for robbing the treasury, for obtaining money under <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> pretences, and for getting himself made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. The Donatists later preferred to say that he was banished for refusing to communicate with the "Caecilianists", and Cresconius even spoke of "the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Zenophilus". But it should have been clear to all that the consecrators of Majorinus had called their opponents traditors in order to cover their own delinquencies.

<p>The Donatist party owed its success in great part to the ability of its leader Donatus, the successor of Majorinus. He appears to have really merited the title of "the Great" by his eloquence and force of character. His writings are lost. His influence with his party was extraordinary. St. Augustine frequently declaims against his arrogance and the impiety with which he was almost worshipped by his followers. In his lifetime he is said to have greatly enjoyed the adulation he received, and after death he was counted as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were ascribed to him.

<p>In 321 Constantine relaxed his vigorous measures, having found that they did not produce the peace he had hoped for, and he weakly begged the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to suffer the Donatists with patience. This was not easy, for the schismatics broke out into <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. At Cirta, Silvanus having returned, they seized the basilica which the emperor had built for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They would not give it up, and Constantine found no better expedient that to build another. Throughout Africa, but above all in Numidia, they were numerous. They taught that in all the rest of the world the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had perished, through having communicated with the traditor Caecilian; their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> alone was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. If a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> came into their churches, they drove him out, and washed with salt the pavement where he had stood. Any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who joined them was forced to be rebaptized. They asserted that their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> were without fault, else their ministrations would be invalid. But in fact they were convicted of drunkenness and other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. St. Augustine tells us on the authority of <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Tichonius</a> that the Donatists held a council of two hundred and seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in which they discussed for seventy-five days the question of rebaptism; they finally decided that in cases where traditors refused to be rebaptized they should be communicated with in spite of this; and the Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Mauretania did not rebaptize traditors until the time of Macarius. Outside Africa the Donatists had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> residing on the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of an adherent in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and at an early period of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> they made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for their small congregation in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which met, it seems, on a hill outside the city, and had the name of "Montenses". This antipapal "succession with a beginning" was frequently ridiculed by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers. The series included Felix, Boniface, Encolpius, Macrobius (c. 370), Lucian, Claudian (c. 378), and again Felix in 411.
<h2>The Circumcellions</h2>

<p>The date of the first appearance of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> is uncertain, but probably they began before the death of Constantine. They were mostly rustic enthusiasts, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no Latin, but spoke Punic; it has been suggested that they may have been of Berber blood. They joined the ranks of the Donatists, and were called by them <em>agnostici</em> and "soldiers of Christ", but in fact were brigands. Troops of them were to be met in all parts of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. They had no regular occupation, but ran about armed, like madmen. They used no swords, on the ground that St. Peter had been told to put his sword into its sheath; but they did continual acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> with clubs, which they called "Israelites". They bruised their victims without killing them, and left them to die. In St. Augustine's time, however, they took to swords and all sorts of weapons; they rushed about accompanied by unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, played, and drank. They battle-cry was <em>Deo laudes</em>, and no bandits were more terrible to meet. They frequently sought death, counting <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. They were especially fond of flinging themselves from precipices; more rarely they sprang into the water or fire. Even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> caught the infection, and those who had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> would cast themselves from the cliffs, to atone for their fault. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> sought death at the hands of others, either by paying men to kill them, by threatening to kill a passer-by if he would not kill them, or by their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> inducing magistrates to have them executed. While <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> still flourished, they would come in vast crowds to any great sacrifice, not to destroy the idols, but to be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. Theodoret says a <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellion</a> was accustomed to announce his intention of becoming a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> long before the time, in order to be well treated and fed like a beast for slaughter. He relates an amusing story (Haer. Fab., IV, vi) to which St. Augustine also refers. A number of these fanatics, fattened like pheasants, met a young man and offered him a drawn sword to smite them with, threatening to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> him if he refused. He pretended to fear that when he had killed a few, the rest might change their minds and avenge the deaths of their fellows; and he insisted that they must all be bound. They agreed to this; when they were defenceless, the young man gave each of them a beating and went his way.

<p>When in controversy with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not proud of their supporters. They declared that self-precipitation from a cliff had been forbidden in the councils. Yet the bodies of these <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicides</a> were <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegiously</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, and crowds celebrated their anniversaries. Their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could not but conform, and they were often glad enough of the strong arms of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a>. Theodoret, soon after St. Augustine's death, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of no other Donatists than the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a>; and these were the typical Donatists in the eyes of all outside Africa. They were especially dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, whose houses they attacked and pillaged. They beat and wounded them, put lime and vinegar on their eyes, and even forced them to be rebaptized. Under Axidus and Fasir, "the leaders of the Saints" in Numidia, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and roads were unsafe, debtors were protected, slaves were set in their masters' carriages, and the masters made to run before them. At length, the Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> invited a general named Taurinus to repress these extravagances. He met with resistance in a place named Octava, and the altars and tablets to be seen there in <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus's</a> time testified to the veneration given to the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> who were slain; but their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> denied them the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. It seems that in 336-7 the <em>proefectus proetorio</em> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> took some measures against the Donatists, for <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> tells us that Donatus wrote him a letter beginning: "Gregory, stain on the senate and disgrace to the prefects".
<h2>The "persecution" of Macarius</h2>

<p>When Constantine became master of the East by defeating Licinius in 323, he was prevented by the rise of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in the East from sending, as he had hoped, Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, to adjust the differences between the Donatists and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Caecilian of Carthage was present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicea</a> in 325, and his successor, Gratus, was at that of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> in 342. The <em>conciliabulum</em> of the Easterns on that occasion wrote a letter to Donatus, as though he were the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> failed to gain the support of the Donatists, who looked upon the whole East as cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which survived in Africa alone. The Emperor Constans was an anxious as his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to give peace to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> In 347 he sent thither two commissioners, Paulus and Macarius, with large sums of money for distribution. Donatus naturally saw in this an attempt to win over his adherents to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by bribery; he received the envoys with insolence: "What has the emperor to do with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>?" said he, and he forbade his people to accept any largess from Constans. In most parts, however, the friendly mission seems to have been not unfavourably received. But at Bagai in Numidia the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Donatus, assembled the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> of the neighbourhood, who had already been excited by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Macarius was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to ask for the protection of the military. The <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> attacked them, and killed two or three soldiers; the troops then became uncontrollable, and slew some of the Donatists. This unfortunate incident was thereafter continually thrown in the teeth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and they were nicknamed Macarians by the Donatists, who declared that Donatus of Bagai had been precipitated from a rock, and that another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Marculus, had been thrown into a well. The existing Acts of two other Donatist <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of 347, Maximian and Isaac, are preserved; they apparently belong to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and are attributed by Harnack to the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Macrobius. It seems that after <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> had begun, the envoys ordered the Donatists to unite with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whether they willed or no. Many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took flight with their partisans; a few joined the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the rest were banished. Donatus the Great died in exile. A Donatist named Vitellius composed a book to show that the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the world.

<p>A solemn <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in each place where the union was completed, and the Donatists set about a rumour that images (obviously of the emperor) were to be placed in the altar and worshipped. As nothing of the sort was found to be done, and as the envoys merely made a speech in favour of unity, it seems that the reunion was effected with less <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> than might have been expected. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the peace that ensued, though they declared that they had no responsibility for the action of Paulus and Macarius. In the following year Gratus, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, held a council, in which the reiteration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was forbidden, while, to please the rallied Donatists, traditors were condemned anew. It was forbidden to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicides</a> as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.
<h2>The restoration of Donatism by Julian</h2>

<p>The peace was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> for Africa, and the forcible means by which it was obtained were justified by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the sectaries. But the accession of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> in 361 changed the face of affairs. Delighted to throw <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into confusion, <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> allowed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been exiled by Constantius to return to the sees which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were occupying. The Donatists, who had been banished by Constans, were similarly allowed to return at their own petition, and received back their <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>. Scenes of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> were the result of this policy both in the East and the West. "Your fury", wrote <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, "returned to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> at the same moment that the devil was set free", for the same emperor restored supremacy to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and the Donatists to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> was considered so discreditable to them, that the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> in 405 had it posted up throughout Africa for their shame. <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> gives a vehement catalogue of the excesses committed by the Donatists on their return. They invaded the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> with arms; they committed so many <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> that a report of them was sent to the emperor. Under the orders of two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a party attacked the basilica of Lemellef; they stripped off the roof, pelted with tiles the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who were round the altar, and killed two of them. In Maruetania riots signalized the return of the Donatists. In Numidia two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> availed themselves of the complaisance of the magistrates to throw a peaceful population into confusion, expelling the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, wounding the men, and not sparing the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children. Since they did not admit the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> administered by traditors, when they seized the churches they cast the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> to the dogs; but the dogs, inflamed with madness, attacked their own masters. An <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampulla</a> of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> thrown out of a window was found unbroken on the rocks. Two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were guilty of rape; one of these seized the aged <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and condemned him to public penance. All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whom they could force to join their party were made penitents, even <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of every rank, and children, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. some for a year, some for a month, some but for a day. In taking possession of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, they destroyed the altar, or removed it, or at least scraped the surface. They sometimes broke up the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, and sold the materials. They washed pavements, walls, and columns. Not content with recovering their churches, they employed <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> functionaries to obtain for them possession of the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, furniture, altar-linen, and especially the books (how did they purify the book? asks <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>), sometimes leaving the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation with no books at all. The cemeteries were closed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dead.

<p>The revolt of Firmus, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Mauretanian chieftain who defied the Roman power and eventually assumed the style of emperor (366-72), was undoubtedly supported by many Donatists. The imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against them were strengthened by Valentinian in 373 and by Gratian, who wrote in 377 to the vicar of prefects, Flavian (himself a Donatist), ordering all the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of the schismatics to be given up to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. St. Augustine shows that even the churches which the Donatists themselves had built were included. The same emperor required Claudian, the Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to return to Africa; as he refused to obey, a Roman council had him driven a hundred miles from the city. It is probable that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Genethlius, caused the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to be mildly administered in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>.
<h2>St. Optatus</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> champion, <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Milevis</a>, published his great work "De schismate Donatistarum" in answer to that of the Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Parmenianus, under Valentinian and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, 364-375 (so <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>). Optatus himself tells us that he was writing after the death of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> (363) and more than sixty years after the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (he means the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 303). The form which we possess is a second edition, brought up to date by the author after the accession of <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (Dec., 384), with a seventh book added to the original six. In the first book he describes the origin and growth of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; in the second he shows the notes of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church; in the third he defends the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the charge of persecuting, with especial reference to the days of Macarius. In the fourth book he refutes Parmenianus's <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from Scripture that the sacrifice of a sinner is polluted. In the fifth book he shows the validity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> even when conferred by sinners, for it is conferred by Christ, the minister being the instrument only. This is the first important statement of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the grace of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is derived from the <em>opus operatum</em> of Christ independently of the worthiness of the minister. In the sixth book he describes the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Donatists and the sacrilegious way in which they had treated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> altars. In the seventh book he treats chiefly of unity and of reunion, and returns to the subject of Macarius.

<p>He calls Parmenianus "brother", and wishes to treat the Donatists as brethren, since they were not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Like some other Fathers, he holds that only <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> go to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; schismatics and all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> will eventually be saved after a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. This is the more curious, because before him and after him in Africa <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> and Augustine both taught that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is as bad as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, if not worse. <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> was much <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by St. Augustine and later by <a href="../cathen/06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a>. He writes with vehemence, sometimes with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, in spite of his protestations of friendliness; but he is carried away by his indignation. His style is forcible and effective, often concise and epigrammatic. To this work he appended a collection of documents containing the evidence for the history he had related. This <em>dossier</em> had certainly been formed much earlier, at all events before the peace of 347, and not long after the latest document it contains, which is dated Feb., 330; the rest are not later than 321, and may possibly have been put together as early as that year. Unfortunately these important historical testimonies have come down to us only in a single mutilated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, the archetype of which was also incomplete. The collection was freely used at the conference of 411 and is often quoted at some length by St. Augustine, who has preserved many interesting portions which would otherwise be unknown to us.
<h2>The Maximianists</h2>

<p>Before Augustine took up the mantle of Optatus together with a double portion of his spirit, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had gained new and victorious arguments from the divisions among the Donatists themselves. Like so many other <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> bred <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> within itself. In Mauretania and Numidia these separated <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> were so numerous that the Donatists themselves could not name them all. We hear of Urbanists; of Claudianists, who were reconciled to the main body by Primianus of Carthage; of Rogatists, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Mauretanian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, of mild character, because no <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellion</a> belonged to it; the Rogatists were severely punished whenever the Donatists could induce the magistrates to do so, and were also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by Optatus of Timgad. But the most famous sectaries were the Maximianists, for the story of their separation from the Donatists reproduces with strange exactitude that of the withdrawal of the Donatists themselves from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and the conduct of the Donatists towards them was so inconsistent with their avowed principles, that it became in the skilled hands of Augustine the most effective weapon of all his controversial armoury.

<p>Primianus, Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Maximianus. The latter (who was, like Majorinus, supported by a lady) got together a council of forty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who summoned Primianus to appear before them. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> refused, insulted their envoys, tried to have them prevented from celebrating the Sacred Mysteries, and had stones thrown at them in the street. The council summoned him before a greater council, which met to the number of a hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Cebarsussum in June, 393. Primianus was deposed; all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were to leave his communion within eight days; if they should delay till after <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, they would not be permitted to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even after penance; the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were allowed until the following <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, under the same penalty. A new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Carthage was appointed in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Maximian himself, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The partisans of Primianus were rebaptized, if they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after the permitted delay. Primianus stood out, and demanded to be judged by a Numidian council; three hundred and ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met at Bagai in April, 394; the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> did not take the place of an accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but himself presided. He was of course acquitted, and the Maximianists were condemned without a hearing. All but the twelve consecrators and their abettors among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Carthage were given till <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> to return; after this period they would be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to do penance. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, composed in eloquent style by Emeritus of Caesarea, and adopted by acclamation, made the Donatists hence-forward ridiculous through their having readmitted schismatics without penance. Maximian's church was razed to the ground, and after the term of grace had elapsed, the Donatists <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the unfortunate Maximianists, representing themselves as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and demanding that the magistrates should enforce against the new sectaries the very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> emperors had drawn up against Donatism. Their influence enabled them to do this, for they were still far more numerous than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the magistrates must often have been of their party. In the reception of those who returned from the party of Maximian they were yet more fatally inconsequent. The rule was theoretically adhered to that all who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> must be rebaptized; but if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> returned, he and his whole flock were admitted without rebaptism. This was allowed even in the case of two of the consecrators of Maximian, Praetextatus of Assur and Felixianus of <a href="../cathen/10658a.htm">Musti</a>, after the proconsul had vainly tried to expel them from their sees, and although a Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rogatus, had already been appointed at Assur. In another case the party of Primianus was more consistent. Salvius, the Maximianist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Membresa, was another of the consecrators. He was twice summoned by the proconsul to retire in favour of the Primianist Restitutus. As he was much respected by the people of Membresa, a mob was brought over from the neighbouring town of Abitene to expel him; the aged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was beaten, and made to dance with dead dogs tied around his neck. But his people built him a new church, and three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> coexisted in this small town, a Maximianist, a Primianist, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.

<p>The leader of the Donatists at this time was Optatus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Thamugadi (Timgad), called Gildonianus, from his friendship with Gildo, the Count of Africa (386-397). For ten years Optatus, supported by Gildo, was the tyrant of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. He <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the Rogatists and Maximianists, and he used troops against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. St. Augustine tells us that his vices and cruelties were beyond description; but they had at least the effect of disgracing the cause of the Donatists, for though he was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> throughout Africa for his wickedness and his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds, yet the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> faction remained always in full communion with this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was a robber, a ravisher, an oppressor, a traitor, and a monster of cruelty. When Gildo fell in 397, after having made himself master of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> for a few months, Optatus was thrown into a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, in which he died.
<h2>Saint Augustine</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> began his victorious campaign against Donatism soon after he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 391. His popular psalm or "Abecedarium" against the Donatists was intended to make known to the people the arguments set forth by <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, with the same conciliatory end in view. It shows that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was founded by traditors, condemned by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and council, separated from the whole world, a cause of division, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and bloodshed; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church is the one Vine, whose branches are over all the earth. After St. Augustine had become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 395, he obtained conferences with some of the Donatist leaders, though not with his rival at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. In 400 he wrote three books against the letter of Parmenianus, refuting his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and his arguments from Scripture. More important were his seven books on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in which, after developing the principle already laid down by <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, that the effect of the sacrament is independent of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the minister, he shows in great detail that the authority of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> is more awkward than convenient for the Donatists. The principal Donatist controversialist of the day was Petilianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantine, a successor of the traditor Silvanus. .htm-->St. Augustine wrote two books in reply to a letter of his against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, adding a third book to answer another letter in which he was himself attacked by Petilianus. Before this last book he published his "De Unitate ecclesiae" about 403. To these works must be added some sermons and some letters which are real treatises.

<p>The arguments used by St. Augustine against Donatism fall under three heads. First we have the historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the regularity of Caecilian's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, of the innocence of Felix of Aptonga, of the guilt of the founders of the "Pure" Church, also the judgment given by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, council, and emperor, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> history of Macarius, the barbarous behaviour of the Donatists under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a>, and so forth. Second, there are the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> arguments: the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, diffused throughout the world, and necessarily one and united; appeal is made to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>, where the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is uninterrupted from St. Peter himself; St. Augustine borrows his list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> (Ep. li), and in his psalm crystallizes the argument into the famous phrase: "That is the rock against which the proud gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> do not prevail." A further appeal is to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, and especially to the Apostolic Churches to which St. Peter, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and St. John addressed epistles - they were not in communion with the Donatists. The validity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the impiety of rebaptizing, are important points. All these arguments were found in <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>. Peculiar to St. Augustine is the necessity of defending <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and the third category is wholly his own. The third division comprises the <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> drawn from the inconsistency of the Donatists themselves: Secundus had pardoned the traditors; full fellowship was accorded to malefactors like Optatus Gildonianus and the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a>; <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Tichonius</a> turned against his own party; Maximian had divided from Primatus just as Majorinus from Caecilian; the Maximianists had been readmitted without rebaptism.

<p>This last method of argument was found to be of great practical value, and many conversions were now taking place, largely on account of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> position in which the Donatists had placed themselves. This point had been especially emphasized by the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> of Sept., 401, which had ordered information as to the treatment of the Maximianists to be gathered from magistrates. The same synod restored the earlier rule, long since abolished, that Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should retain their rank if they returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Pope Anastasius I wrote to the council urging the importance of the Donatist question. Another council in 403 organized public disputations with the Donatists. This energetic action roused the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> to new <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. The life of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was endangered. His future biographer, <a href="../cathen/12318a.htm">St. Possidius</a> of <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a>, was insulted and ill-treated by a party led by a Donatist <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Crispinus. The latter's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, also named Crispinus, was tried at Carthage and fined ten pounds of gold as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, though the fine was remitted by Possidius. This is the first case known to us in which a Donatist is declared a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but henceforth it is the common style for them. The cruel and disgusting treatment of Maximianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bagai, is also related by St. Augustine in detail. The <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> was induced by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to renew the old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the Donatists at the beginning of 405. Some good resulted, but the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> were excited to new <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. The letter of Petilianus was defended by a grammarian named Cresconius, against whom .htm-->St. Augustine published a reply in four books. The third and fourth books are especially important, as in these he argues from the Donatists' treatment of the Maximianists, quotes the Acts of the Council of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> held by Secundus, and cites other important documents. The saint also replied to a pamphlet by Petilianus, "De unico baptismate".
<h2>The "Collatio" of 411</h2>

<p>St. Augustine had once hoped to conciliate the Donatists by reason only. The <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a>, the cruelties of Optatus of Thamugadi, the more recent attacks on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had all given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that repression by the secular arm was absolutely unavoidable. It was not necessarily a case of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for religious opinions, but simply one of the protection of life and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the ensuring of freedom and safety for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> went much further than this. Those of Honorius were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> anew in 408 and 410. In 411 the method of disputation was organized on a grand scale by order of the emperor himself at the request of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Their case was now complete and unanswerable. But this was to be brought home to the people of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and public opinion was to be forced to recognize the facts, by a public exposure of the weakness of the separatist position. The emperor sent an official named Marcellinus, an excellent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to preside as <em>cognitor</em> at the conference. He issued a proclamation declaring that he would exercise absolute impartiality in his conduct of the proceedings and in his final judgment. The Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who should come to the conference were to receive back for the present the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> which had been taken from them. The number of those who arrived at Carthage was very large, though somewhat less that the two hundred and seventy-nine whose signatures were appended to a letter to the president. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> numbered two hundred and eighty-six. Marcellinus decided that each party should elect seven disputants, who alone should speak, seven advisers whom they might consult, and four secretaries to keep the records. Thus only thirty-six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would be present in all. The Donatists pretended that this was a device to prevent their great numbers being known; but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> did not object to all of them being present, provided no disturbance was caused.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> speaker, besides the amiable and venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Aurelius, was of course Augustine, whose fame had already spread through the whole Church. His friend, Alypius of <a href="../cathen/14553b.htm">Tagaste</a>, and his disciple and biographer, Possidius, were also among the seven. The principal Donatist speakers were Emeritus of Caesarea in Mauretania (Cherchel) and Petilianus of Constantine (Cirta); the latter spoke or interrupted about a hundred and fifty times, until on the third day he was so hoarse that he had to desist. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> made a generous proposal that any Donatist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who should join the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should preside alternately with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the episcopal chair, unless the people should object, in which case both must resign and a new election be made. The conference was held on the 1, 3, and 8 June. The policy of the Donatists was to raise technical objections, to cause delay, and by all manner of means to prevent the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> disputants from stating their case. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> case was, however, clearly enunciated on the first day in letters which were read, addressed by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to Marcellinus and to their deputies to instruct them in the procedure. A discussion of important points was arrived at only on the third day, amid many interruptions. It was then evident that the unwillingness of the Donatists to have a real discussion was due to the fact that they could not reply to the arguments and documents brought forward by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The insincerity as well as the inconsequence and clumsiness of the sectaries did them great harm. The main <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> points and historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were made perfectly plain. The <em>cognitor</em> summed up in favor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The churches which had been provisionally restored to the Donatists were to be given up; their assemblies were forbidden under grave penalties. The lands of those who permitted <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> on their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> were to be confiscated. The minutes of this great conference were submitted to all the speakers for their approval, and the report of each speech (mostly only a single sentence) was signed by the speaker as a guarantee of its accuracy. We possess these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in full only as far as the middle of the third day; for the rest only the headings of each little speech are preserved. These headings were composed by order of Marcellinus in order to facilitate reference. On account of the dullness and a length of the full report, St. Augustine composed a popular resume of the discussions in his "Breviculus Collationis", and went with more detail into a few points in a final pamphlet, "Ad Donatistas post Collationem".

<p>On 30 Jan., 412, Honorius issued a final law against the Donatists, renewing old legislation and adding a scale of fines for Donatist <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and their wives: the <em>illustres</em> were to pay fifty pounds of gold, the <em>spectabiles</em> forty, the <em>senatores</em> and <em>sacerdotales</em> thirty, the <em>clarissimi</em> and <em>principales</em> twenty, the <em>decuriones</em>, <em>negotiatores</em>, and <em>plebeii</em> five, which <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> were to pay ten pounds of silver. Slaves were to be reproved by their masters, <em>coloni</em> were to be constrained by repeated beatings. All <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were exiled from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In 414 the fines were increased for those of high rank: a proconsul, vicar, or count was fined two hundred pounds of gold, and a senator a hundred. A further law was published in 428. The good Marcellinus, who had become the friend of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, fell a victim (it is supposed) to the rancour of the Donatists; for he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in 413, as though an accomplice in the revolt of Heraclius, Count of Africa, in spite of the orders of the emperor, who did not believe him guilty. Donatism was now discredited by the conference and proscribed by the persecuting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Honorius. The <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> made some dying efforts, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was killed by them at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. It does not seem that the decrees were rigidly carried out, for the Donatist <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was still found in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The ingenious Emeritus was at Caesarea in 418, and at the wish of <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> .htm-->St. Augustine had a conference with him, without result. But on the whole Donatism was dead. Even before the conference the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishops in Africa were considerably more numerous than the Donatists, except in Numidia. From the time of the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in 430 little is heard of them until the days of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, when they seem to have revived somewhat, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> complained to the Emperor Maurice that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were not strictly enforced. They finally disappeared with the irruptions of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>.
<h2>Donatist writers</h2>

<p>There seems to have been no lack of literary activity among the Donatists of the fourth century, though little remains to us. The works of Donatus the Great were known to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, but have not been preserved. His book on the Holy Spirit is said by that Father to have been <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. It is possible that the Pseudo-Cyprianic "De singularitate clericorum" is by Macrobius; and the "Adversus aleatores" is by an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, either Donatist or <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianist</a>. The arguments of Parmenianus and Cresconius are known to us, though their works are lost; but Monceaux has been able to restore from St. Augustine's citations short works by Petilianus of Constantine and Gaudentius of Thamugadi, and also a <em>libellus</em> by a certain Fulgentius, from the citations in the Pseudo-Augustinian "Contra Fulgentium Donatistam". Of <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Tichonius</a>, or Tyconius, we still possess the treatise "De Septem regulis" (P.L., XVIII; new ed. by Professor Burkitt, in Cambridge "Texts and Studies", III, 1, 1894) on the interpretation of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. His commentary on the Apocalypse is lost; it was used by Jerome, Primasius, and Beatus in their commentaries on the same book. <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Tichonius</a> is chiefly celebrated for his views on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which were quite inconsistent with Donatism, and which Parmenianus tried to refute. In the famous words of St. Augustine (who often refers to his illogical position and to the force with which her argued against the cardinal tenets of his own <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>): "Tichonius assailed on all sides by the voices of the holy pages, awoke and saw the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> diffused throughout the world, as had been foreseen and foretold of her so long before by the hearts and mouths of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. And seeing this, he undertook to demonstrate and assert against his own party that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of man, however villainous and monstrous, can interfere with the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor can any impiety of any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cause the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be made void as to the existence and diffusion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the ends of the earth, which was promised to the Fathers and now is manifest" (Contra Ep. Parmen., I, i).
