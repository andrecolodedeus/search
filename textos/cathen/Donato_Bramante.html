<h1>Donato Bramante</h1>  

<p>(Also called <font size=-2>D</font>'A<font size=-2>GNOLO</font> after his father Angelo)

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> architect and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. about 1444 at Monte Asdrualdo (hence, sometimes A<font size=-2>SDRUALDINO</font>); d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 11 March, 1514. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his early youth. His early artistic development also, about which <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> has made so many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> statements, is mostly a matter of conjecture. Today, however, it seems fairly certain that Laurana, the architect of the ducal palace at <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, showed him the way to the impressive style of the High <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. Bramante's artistic activity is divided into two periods of which the first was spent in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the other in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His work in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> is characterized by a pronounced picturesque, decorative style. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the other hand, we find a style which is more proper to the High <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, exemplified in works that are, as far as possible, free from all external decoration, impressive by reason of their proportions, and recalling the antique by their grandeur and power. In 1476 Bramante became the court architect of Lodovico Sforza (Il Moro), having been in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, as has been abundantly shown, from 1474. At first he seems to have been engaged principally as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, following the vigorous manner of <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a> and <a href="../cathen/10169c.htm">Melozzo da Forl&#237;</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that only scanty remains of his work at this time have been found. Such are the recently discovered fresco fragments, transported from the Casa Prinetti to the Brera (single figures of warriors, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, poets, and singers); the more poorly preserved decorative <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the Casa Fontana, and among panel pictures undoubtedly the Scourging of Christ (Badia Chiaravalle near <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>). Bartolomeo Suardi, called Bramantino [cf. Suida in Jahrbuch der Kunstsammlungen des allerh&ouml;chsten Kaiserhauses (1905), 1 sqq.], was his assistant and rather weak imitator in the field of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, but not his teacher as was thought by Vassari (ed. Milanesi-Sansoni, IV, 175). If Bramante occasionally devoted himself to Gothic, as he unquestionably did in some designs for the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he exhibits from the start an excellent style, which, as <em>Stile Bramantesco,</em> became typical for the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> architecture of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. It is characterized by ambitious proportions, internal concentration, a greater organic relation of parts, and by rich and fresh decorative forms.

<p>His first great achievement in this line is the choir of the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> presso S. Satiro, begun in 1476. The choir has a flat end and a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, rendered in relieved perspective. The adjoining <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, octagonal in plan and surmounted by a <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, is charming on account of the richness of the interior articulation and most effective space-development. Its two interior stories are separated by a splendid terra-cotta frieze overlaid with bronze. The church came to have the same significance in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as the Pazzi Chapel or the Sacristy of Santo Spirito in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Still richer in ornament are the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> and choir of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Grazie (1492-99), by which the superiority of the imposing new style over the Gothic can best be shown. In addition to these great churches, the Canonica, or canons' residence, of San Ambrogio (1492, only half completed) and the remodelled court of the Ospedale Maggiore are the only examples of Bramante's genius in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. A further development of this somewhat more decorative style to the larger, simpler proportions of the Roman period is suggested by the church of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, Santa Maria di Capenuova in Pavia (1492), and also by the churches of Busto Arsizio and Santa Maria in Legnano. The magnificent articulation of the fa&#231;ade of Abbiategrasso shows in full development the powerful boldness of the Roman style whose growth, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was influenced not only by the antique, but also by the use of a more intractable material (travertine) which made small, detail treatment an impossibility. The date of this church is probably 1497 instead of 1477, as Geym&uuml;ller read it. Other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> structures of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> upon which the influence or imitation of Bramante is perceptible, are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a> (south portal), the Pilgrimage Church at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, and the Incoronata at <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a>.

<p>Even greater is the number of structures indirectly influenced by Bramante in Northern and Middle <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> after the downfall of the Sforza in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1499). Bramante at the end of the same year moved to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he found in <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> and still more in <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> magnanimous patrons. Here, too, very little is known of his early work. It is still disputed whether or not the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Pace and the fa&#231;ade of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Anima can be ascribed to him. This is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the immense palace of Cardinal Raffaello Riario (the present Cancelleria) with the adjoining church of San Lorenzo in Damaso. On account of the inscribed dates (1489 and 1495) Gnoli ascribes them not to Bramante but to a <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> master, whereas Geym&uuml;ller more correctly persists in ascribing them to Bramante, basing his view on considerations of style and on Bramante's relation with the Sforzas and the Riarios; this would also explain Bramante's working in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> prior to 1492 [cf. Gnoli in Arch. stor. dell' arte (1892), IV, 176 sqq.; Riv. d'Italia (1898); and Geym&uuml;ller in Rassegna d'arte (October and December, 1901), I]. The Palace Giraud Torlonia is a structure similar to the Cancellaria in its beautiful rhythmic articulation, its simplicity, and its monumental character. Undoubtedly Bramante is the designer of the pretty little circular temple in the court of San Pietro in Montorio (completed in 1502). It is planned quite after the manner of an antique temple and is the first structure consciously designed and executed in the classic spirit, embodying the purest and simplest forms and the most agreeable proportions. A peristyle, never carried out, was intended to complete the building. Other works of Bramante's first Roman period are the choir of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> del Popolo, the plan for the reconstruction of the Vatican, the extension of the Belvedere court, etc. The most majestic creation, not only of Bramante and of the High <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, but in fact of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, is the new St. Peter's. According to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, this was intended originally to enclose the magnificent <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, begun by <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo</a>. But on account of the hopelessly ruinous condition of the old St. Peter's, its rebuilding became an immediate necessity and, indeed, was determined upon shortly after the accession of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, probably in connexion with the reconstruction of the Vatican. As early as 18 April, 1506, the cornerstone of the pier of St. Helena was laid, and a year later those of the other three piers at the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> were in position. The ways and means employed by Bramante in dealing with the old building brought him many reproaches for his lack of sentiment, and earned for him the nickname of <em>Ruinante</em>. Nevertheless, the incomparable significance of this creation must not be overlooked because of such romantic sentiments, nor must it be forgotten that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had Bramante's plan carried out in spite of all remonstrances and of the enormous cost.

<p>The artistic aims of the structure, or more especially of the original plans, are revealed by the numerous drawings, executed partly by the master himself, and partly by his assistants. Their critical examination and &aelig;sthetic appreciation are among Geym&uuml;ller's chief achievements. According to him this brilliant plan passed through three stages: in the first, only a small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> was contemplated; in the second, the continuation of the erection of the new buildings undertaken during the reigns of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> and <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>; only in the third stage was an entirely independent new building decided upon. For it Bramante had in view, from the first, a building of centralized plan, more particularly the plan of a Greek cross. In this he saw the architectonic ideal which combined the greatest harmony, the most serviceable space-relations, as well as a tendency to the monumentally sublime. It was only as an alternative, so far as can be judged from extant sketches, that the master seems to have reserved for himself the possibility of using the Latin cross, being evidently compelled to make concessions to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. According to the oldest drawings and a memorial medal of Caradosos, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1506, the original ground plan was a pure Greek cross, the termination of whose arms was apsidal on the interior, rectangular on the exterior. An immense <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> was carried over the crossing. The predominant form of the interior was rotunda-like. For the four corners immense <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were planned, which again repeated the Greek cross; they were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by smaller domes, and each was flanked on the exterior by a tower. Between the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apses</a> of the cross-arms and these corner-towers lay large <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibules</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the flanking domes. In a second design the cross-arms are rounded and enclosed by immense <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> halls. The main <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> is encircled by an arcaded <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a>. The piers of the domes were enriched by niches emphasizing the dominant <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the interior. In <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, San Lorenzo, a church of centralized plan (see <a href="../cathen/03094a.htm">B<font size=-2>YZANTINE</font> A<font size=-2>RCHITECTURE</font></a>), evidently served as a model for this design. The principal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, however, were taken from the Pantheon and the Temple of Peace. The master was permitted to see only the initial steps towards the execution of his plan. He was able, nevertheless, to establish firmly its main lines for the architects who followed, inasmuch as the dome-supports with their arches, the southern <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, and the side domes were carried out under his direction. After his death in 1514 the continuation of the work was entrusted to the aged Fra Giocondo, and soon after (on a recommendation made by Bramante during his lifetime) to <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. Later on, <a href="../cathen/13443a.htm">San Gallo</a> and <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Peruzzi</a> were placed in charge. Bramante's plans suffered many changes and encroachments under the various directors until <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo</a> returned to the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the brilliant creator, and by the completion of the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> substantially carried the work to a conclusion. The curvature of the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> is not quite as bold and effective as that planned by Bramante; on the other hand it offers in its greater rise, a much more elegant and vigorous silhouette.

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> the influence of Bramante was predominant. Not only were the most daring works of architecture entrusted to him, but all other important building operations, and, in general, all artistic undertakings depended on his initiative and <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and of the <em>loggie</em> and the <em>stanze,</em> or halls, of the Vatican. In this way <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, his younger townsman, received the greatest possible aid and favour, whilst Bramante's intrigues against <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo</a> were positively spiteful according to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>. Through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo's</a> mighty genius, he assigned to this great master only unsuitable and unpleasant commissions. Though these tragically strained relations between the two great artists at the court of the Rovere <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> seem to be a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> puzzle, the key is to be found in the hard and self-torturing character of the Florentine. Bramante, on the contrary, was a man who enjoyed life in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and liberal way, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to live up to the dignity of his prominent position. The manifold character of his interests and activities is yet visible in his poems which have come down to us. With <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo</a>, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, and Leonardo, he is one of the great intellects of the High <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; he resembles them also in the fact that only a small part of his plans was completed.
