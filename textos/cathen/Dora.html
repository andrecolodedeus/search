<h1>Dora</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Palestina Prima. The name (<em>D&ocirc;r</em>) in <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> languages means "dwelling", "abode". On the coming of the Hebrews, the King of Dora or Dor entered into the confederation against <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> and was defeated with the confederates (<a href="../bible/jos011.htm#vrs2">Joshua 11:2</a>; <a href="../bible/jos012.htm#vrs23">12:23</a>). The town was first allotted to the <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">tribe of Aser</a> (<a href="../bible/jos017.htm#vrs11">Joshua 17:11</a>), then given to Manasses (<a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs27">Judges 1:27</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch007.htm#vrs29">1 Chronicles 7:29</a>), who failed to expel the inhabitants and imposed on them a tribute; the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> may have captured only the upper city (<em>Nafat D&ocirc;r</em>), called Napheddor or Phenneddor by the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, and <em>regiones</em> or <em>provincia Dor</em> by the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> King Rameses III set up a Ph&oelig;necian colony at Dora; according to Stephan of Byzantium the Ph&oelig;necians settled there because the coast abounded in the shells that produced the famous <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyrian</a> purple dye. Dora was united by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Kingdom of Israel</a> and governed under Solomon by Benabinadab, one of the twelve prefects (<a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#vrs11">1 Kings 4:11</a>). Later it underwent successively the rule of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, the Greeks, and the Lagides. In 217 <font size=-2 >B.C.</font> it was unsuccessfully besieged by Antiochus the Great; at a later date it was taken by the kings of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. In 139 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the usurper Tryphon, who had taken refuge at Dora, was besieged by Antiochus (VII) Sidetes with a fleet, 120,000 foot, and 8000 horse (<a href="../bible/1ma015.htm#vrs13">1 Maccabees 15:13</a>). The city then fell into the hands of a private individual called Zoilus, at whose death it was added by Alexander Jamm&aelig;us to his Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. When Pompey conquered <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, he granted Dora an autonomous constitution; from this time dates its peculiar era, 64-63 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, known chiefly through numerous <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. As Dora had suffered much from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Gabinius rebuilt it (56 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). In 42 of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> its inhabitants were still disputing with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom they seem to have specially <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. In the time of Pliny the town was in a state of utter decay; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> speaks of "the ruins of that city (Dora) which had been formerly so powerful". He may have exaggerated its decay, or the city may have risen from its ruins.

<p>As early as the fifth century it was the residence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Sidus, and suffragan to C&aelig;sarea; there is record also of Barachius in 518, John in 536, Stephen, the friend of St. Sophronius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the great opponent of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Dora was called Pirgul, a corruption of Greek <em>p&uacute;rgos,</em> "tower", according to Foucher of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> (Gesta Dei per Francos, ed. Bongars, 396); it was also known as Merla (Rey, Les colonies franques de Syrie, Paris, 1883, 422). There are records of five <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (Eubel, I, 235; II, 161). Another is mentioned in "Revue b&eacute;n&eacute;dictine" (1904), p. 62. Its modern Arabic name is Tantourah. Dora is a village of about 1500 inhabitants, on the seashore between Caifa and C&aelig;sarea, nearer the latter. The harbour is frequented by small boats; the old port, situated more to the north, was enclosed by two headlands lengthened by two piers. To the east are vast quarries and the ancient <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">necropolis</a>. The ruins of the ancient city cover a space about four-fifths of a mile long by one-third broad. Many Jewish colonists have recently settled in the vicinity.
