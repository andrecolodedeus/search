<h1>Douai</h1>  

<p>(Town and University of Douai)</p>

<p>(D<font size=-2>OUAY,</font> D<font size=-2>OWAY</font>)

<p>The town of Douai, in the department of Nord, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, is on the River Scarpe, some twenty miles south of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>. It contains about 30,000 inhabitants and was formerly the seat of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. It was strongly fortified, and the old ramparts have only been removed in recent years. The town flourished in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and the church of Notre-Dame dates from the twelfth century.

<p>To <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the name Douai will always be bound up with the college founded by <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a> during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, where the majority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in penal times, and to which the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was largely due. Several other British establishments were founded there &#151; colleges for the Scots and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> &#151; and Douai became the chief centre for those who were exiled for the Faith. The University of Douai may be said to date from 31 July, 1559, when <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> (in whose dominions it was then situated) obtained a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> from <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>, authorizing its establishment the avowed object being the preservation of the purity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> died before he had <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which was, however, confirmed by his successor, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, 6 January, 1560. The letters patent of Philip II, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 19 January, 1561, authorized the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with five faculties; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, canon law, <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, medicine, and arts. The formal inauguration took place 5 October, 1562, when there was a public procession of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and a sermon was preached in the market-place by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>.

<p>There were already a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> living at Douai, and their influence made itself felt in the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In its early years, several of the chief posts were held by Englishmen, mostly from Oxford. The first chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was Dr. Richard Smith, formerly Fellow of Merton and regius professor of divinity at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; the regius professor of canon law at Douai for many years was Dr. Owen Lewis, Fellow of New College, who had held the corresponding post at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; the first principal of Marchiennes College was Richard White, formerly Fellow of New College; while Allen himself, after taking his licentiate at Douai in 1560, became regius professor of divinity. It is reasonable to suppose that many of the traditions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Oxford were perpetuated at Douai. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was, however, far from being even predominantly English; it was founded on the model of that of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, from which seat of learning the majority of the first professors were drawn. The two features already mentioned &#151; that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was founded during the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, to combat the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and that it was to a considerable extent under English influences &#151; explain the fact that William Allen, when seeking a home for a projected English college abroad, turned his eyes towards Douai. The project arose from a conversation which he had with Dr. Vendeville, then regius professor of canon law in the University of Douai, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, whom he accompanied on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the autumn of 1567; and the foundation took definite shape when Allen made a beginning in a hired house on Michaelmas Day, 1568. His object was to gather some of the numerous body of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who, having been forced to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, were scattered in different countries on the Continent, and to give them facilities for continuing their studies, so that when the time came for the re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, which Allen was always confident could not be far distant, there might be a body of learned <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> ready to return to their country. This was of course a very different thing from sending missionaries over in defiance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> while <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> still remained in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. This latter plan was an afterthought and a gradual growth from the circumstances in which the college found itself, though eventually it became its chief work.

<p>Allen's <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and influence soon attracted a numerous band of scholars, and a few years after the foundation of the college the students numbered more than one hundred and fifty. A steady stream of controversial works issued form Douai, some by Allen himself, others by such men as <a href="../cathen/14249b.htm">Thomas Stapleton</a>, Richard Bristowe, and others almost equally well known. The preparation of the <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Douay Bible</a> was among their chief undertakings. It is estimated that before the end of the sixteenth century more than three hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had been sent on the English mission, nearly a third of whom suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; and almost as many had been banished. By the end of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the college counted more than one hundred and sixty <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Allen had at first no regular source of income, but depended on the generosity of a few friends, and especially upon the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Saint-Vaast at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, Anchin, and Marchiennes, which, at the suggestion of Dr. Vendeville, had from time to time subscribed towards the work. Many private donations were also received from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. After a few years, seeing the extreme need of the college and the importance of the work it was doing, Allen applied to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, who in 1565 granted a regular pension of one hundred gold crowns a month, which continued to be paid down to the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Allen himself gave his whole salary as regius professor of divinity. The work of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was not allowed to proceed without opposition, which at one time became so strong that Allen's life was in danger, and in 1578 the English were all expelled from Douai. The college was established temporarily at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>; but possession was retained of the house at Douai, and in 1593 it was found possible to return there. By this time Allen had been called to reside in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he died 16 Oct., 1594. Under his successor, Dr. Richard Barrett, the work was extended to include a preparatory course in humanities, so that it became a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as well as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. In 1603 under <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Dr. Worthington</a>, the third president, a regular college was built, opposite the old <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of St-Jacques, in the Rue des Morts, so called on account of the adjoining cemetery. The town at this time formed a single <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. In the eighteenth century it was divided into four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and the present church of St-Jacques dates from that time.



<p>The English College was the first to be opened in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The Coll&#232;ge d'Anchin was opened a few months later, endowed by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Anchin, and entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1570 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Marchiennes founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for the study of law. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Vast founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of that name. Later on, we find the College of St. Thomas Aquinas, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the Coll&#232;ge du Roi, and others. The remaining British establishments were all exclusively for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> was originally a Spanish foundation. It was established before the end of the sixteenth century, and endowed with 5,000 florins a year by the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The course of studies lasted six years and the students attended lectures at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The Scots' College has an unfortunate <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> in consequence of the long dispute between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> which centred round it in later times. It was established in 1594, not as a new foundation, but as the continuation of a secular college at Pont- &#224;-Mousson in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, which, owing to the unhealthfulness of the site, had to seek a new home. In 1506, however, it moved again, and it was not till after several further migrations that it settled finally at Douai in 1612. The college was devoid of resources, and it was due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts of Father Parsons in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and of Father Creighton in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, that numerous benefactions were given, and it was placed on a permanent footing. For this reason, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> afterwards claimed the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as their own, although it was admitted that in its early years <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there. Appeals and counter-appeals were made, but the question was still unsettled when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were expelled from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1764. The French Government, however, recognized the claims of the Scotch <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and allowed them to continue the work of the college under a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> chosen from their own body. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> houses at Douai were near together and were both bound up in their history with the restoration of the respective orders in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was founded mainly through the instrumentality of <a href="../cathen/06418a.htm">Father John Gennings</a>, the brother of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. It was established in temporary quarters in 1618, the students for the time attending the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; but by 1621 they had built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and provided for all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> tuition within their own walls. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> began in 1605, in hired apartments belonging to the Coll&#232;ge d'Anchin, but a few years later, through the generosity of Abbot Caravel of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint-Vaast, they obtained land and built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which was opened in 1611. The house acquired a high reputation for learning, and many of the professors of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were at different times chosen from among its members.

<p>Returning now to the English College, we come upon the unfortunate disputes between the seculars and regulars in the seventeenth century. <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Dr. Worthington</a>, though himself a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, was under the influence of Father Parsons, and for a long time the students attended the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. A visitation of the college, however, laid bare many shortcomings in its administration and in the end <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Worthington</a> was deposed. His successor, Dr. Kellison (1631-1641), succeeded in restoring the reputation of the college, while he gradually arranged for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> tuition to be given within its walls. In the latter half of the seventeenth and the early years of the eighteenth century, the English College went through a troubled time. During the presidency of Dr. Hyde (1646-1651), the University of Douai obtained certain controlling <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the college, which claim, however, he successfully withstood. His successor, Dr. George Leyburn (1652-1670), fell out with the "Old Chapter", in the absence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He attacked one <a href="../cathen/15613a.htm">Mr. White (alias Blacklo)</a>, a prominent member of their body, and procured a condemnation of his writings by the University of Douai. In the end, however, he himself found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to retire in favour of his nephew, Dr. John Leyburn, who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. Hardly was the dispute with the "Blackloists" (as they were called) finished, when a further storm of an even more serious nature arose, the centre being <a href="../cathen/07155b.htm">Dr. Hawarden</a> who was professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and then of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the English College for seventeen years. His reputation became so great that when a vacancy occurred in 1702 he was solicited by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the chief members of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and the magistrates of the town to accept the post of regius professor of divinity. His candidature, however, was opposed by a party headed by the vice-chancellor. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> also declared against him, accusing him, and through him the English College, of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. In the end, <a href="../cathen/07155b.htm">Dr. Hawarden</a> retired from Douai and went on the mission in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; and a visitation of the college, made by order of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, resulted in completely clearing it of the imputation. In 1677, Douai was taken by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> has been under French control, except for the short time that it was held by the English after the siege of the Duke of Marlborough in 1710; but it was retaken by the French the following year.

<p>During the rest of the eighteenth century, there were no important political changes until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> broke out. The hopes which the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had rested on the Stuart <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had now vanished, and the only prospect open to them lay in their foreign centres of which Douai was the chief. To these centres they devoted the greater part of their energy. Under the presidency of Dr. Witham (1715-1738) who is considered a second founder, the English College at Douai was rebuilt on a substantial scale and rescued from overwhelming <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>; it had lost nearly all its endowment in the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Mississippi scheme, or "South Sea Bubble". The <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> was rebuilt about the middle of the century, and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> between 1776 and 1781. But all were destined to come to an end a few years after this, under the Reign of Terror.

<p>As a town, Douai suffered less than many others at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> kept up its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character to the end, and it was one of the five typical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> to which Pitt appealed for an authoritative declaration as to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on the "deposing power" of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. During the Reign of Terror, however, it suffered the same fate as many similar establishments. When all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the town were called upon in 1791 to take the "Civic Oath", the members of the British establishments claimed exemption in virtue of their nationality. The plea was allowed for a time; but after the execution of Louis XVI, when <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was declared between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it was not to be expected that this immunity would continue. The superiors and students of most of the British establishments took flight and succeeded in reaching <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The members of the English College, with their president, Rev. John Daniel, remained in the hope of saving the college; but in October, 1793, they were taken to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Doullens in Picardy, together with six Anglo- <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had remained for a similar purpose. After undergoing many dangers and hardships, they were allowed to return to Douai in November, 1794, and a few months later, by the exertions of Dr. Stapleton, President of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> (who with his students had likewise been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Doullens), they were set at liberty and allowed to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The English collegians never returned to Douai. The <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> had recently been repealed, and they founded two colleges to continue the work of Douai &#151; Crook Hall (afterwards removed to <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>) in the North, and St. Edmund's, Old Hall, in the South. The Roman pension was divided equally between these two until the French occupied <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1799, when it ceased to be paid. Both these colleges exist at the present day. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> united all the British establishments in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under one administrator, Rev. Francis Walsh, an Irishman. On the restoration of the Bourbons, a large sum of money was paid to the English Government to indemnify those who had suffered by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; but none of this ever reached <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hands, for it was ruled that as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges were carried on in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the sole reason that they were illegal in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, they must be considered French, not English, establishments. The buildings, however, were restored to their rightful owners, and most of them were sold. The Anglo-Benedictines alone retained their ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; and as the community of St. Gregory was then permanently established at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a>, they handed over their house at Douai to the community of St. Edmund, which had formerly been located in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. These <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> carried on a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Douai until 1903, when in consequence of the Associations' Law passed by the Government they were forced to leave. They returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and settled at Woolhampton, near Reading.
