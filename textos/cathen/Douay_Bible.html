<h1>Douay Bible</h1>  

<p>The original Douay Version, which is the foundation on which nearly all English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> versions are still based, owed its existence to the religious controversies of the sixteenth century. Many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> versions of the Scriptures had been issued and were used largely by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> for polemical purposes. The renderings of some of the texts showed evident signs of controversial bias, and it became of the first importance for the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the day to be furnished with a translation of their own, on the accuracy of which they could depend and to which they could appeal in the course of argument. The work of preparing such a version was undertaken by the members of the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, founded by William Allen (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) in 1568. The chief share of the translating was borne by Dr. Gregory Martin, formerly of St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. His text was revised by <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Thomas Worthington</a>, Richard Bristowe, John Reynolds, and Allen himself &#151; all of them Oxford men. A series of notes was added, designed to answer the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> arguments of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>; these were prepared by Allen, assisted by Bristowe and <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Worthington</a>.

<p>The object of the work was, of course not limited to controversial purposes; in the case of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, especially, it was meant for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> use among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The fact however, that the primary end was controversial explains the course adopted by the translators. In the first place they translated directly, not from the original Hebrew or Greek, but from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. This had been declared authoritative for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; but it was also commonly admitted that the text was purer than in any <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> at that time extant in the original languages. Then, also, in the translation, many technical words were retained bodily, such as <em>pasch, <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">parasceve</a>, <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">azymes</a>,</em> etc. In some instances, also where it was found difficult or impossible to find a suitable English equivalent for a Latin word, the latter was retained in an anglicized form. Thus in Phil., ii, 8, we get "He <em>exinanited</em> himself", and in <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs28">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "Christ was offered once to <em>exhaust</em> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many". It was considered that an ordinary reader, finding the word unintelligible, would pause and inquire its meaning and that this was preferable to satisfying him with an inadequate rendering. In other cases latinisms seem to have crept in unawares, as in <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs1">Luke 10:1</a>, "Our Lord <em>designed</em> also other seventy-two" or in Phil., ii, 10, "In the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>, every knee bow of the <em>celestials, terrestrials</em> and <em>infernals</em>". The proper names are usually (though not always) taken from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>; but the word <em>Dominus</em> is rendered throughout <em>Our</em> Lord. The general result was a version in cumbersome English, so full of latinisms as to be in places hardly readable, but withal scholarly and accurate.

<p>In the year 1578, owing to political troubles, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was temporarily transferred from <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (which was then in the dominions of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>) to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and during its sojourn there, in 1582, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was published, and became consequently known as the "Rheims Testament". It contained no episcopal imprimatur, but a recommendation was appended signed by four divines of the University of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was delayed by want of means, until the whole Bible was eventually published in two quarto volumes, in 1609 and 1610, by which time the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had returned to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and the recommendation was signed by three <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of that <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> appeared nearly thirty years before the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">"Authorized Version"</a>, and although not officially mentioned as one of the versions to be consulted, it is now commonly recognized to have had a large influence on the <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">King James Version</a> (see Preface to R. V., i, 2; also, Carleton, "Rheims and the English Bible"). The <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> Testament was reprinted twice at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> &#151; in 1600 and 1621 &#151; and a fourth edition was issued at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> in 1633. Then it was allowed to rest for over a century, before a fifth edition appeared, with some slight changes, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1728, but without any place of publication stated. It is believed to have been printed in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and was edited by Dr. Challoner (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>), and Father Blyth, a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>. The Douay Bible was never after this printed abroad. A sixth edition of the <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> Testament was printed at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a> in 1788, and a seventh dated Dublin, 1803, which was the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> edition. Several <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> editions have appeared, the best known being a curious work by Rev. William Fulke, first published in 1589, with the <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> text and that of the Bishops' Bible in parallel columns. A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> edition of the <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> Testament was also brought out by Leavitt of New York, in 1834.

<p>Although the Bibles in use in the twentieth century by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> are popularly styled the Douay Version, they are most improperly so called; they are founded, with more or less alteration, on a series of revisions undertaken by <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Bishop Challoner</a> in 1749-52. His object was to meet the practical want felt by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his day of a Bible moderate in size and price, in readable English, and with notes more suitable to the time. He brought out three editions of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, in 1749, 1750, and 1752 respectively, and one of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in 1750. The changes introduced by him were so considerable that, according to <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>, they "almost amounted to a new translation". So also, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> wrote, "To call it any longer the Douay or Rheimish Version is an abuse of terms. It has been altered and modified until scarcely any sense remains as it was originally published". In nearly every case Challoner's changes took the form of approximating to the <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">Authorized Version</a>, though his three editions of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> differ from one another in numerous passages. The best known version published in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in modern times was perhaps <a href="../cathen/07160a.htm">Haydock's</a>, which was first issued at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> in fortnightly parts in 1811-12. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> editions are mostly known by the names of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who gave the imprimatur: as Dr. Carpenter's <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (1783); Dr. Troy's Bible (1791); Dr. Murray's (1825); and Dr. Denvir's (1836) &#151; the last two of which have often been reprinted, and were circulated largely in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Around the turn of the century, the issue of the sixpenny <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> by Burns and Oates of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, by its large circulation, made the text adopted therein &#151; Challoner's of 1749 &#151; the standard one, especially as the same was adopted in Dr. Murray's and Dr. Denvir's Bibles. In America an independent revision of the Douay Version by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> (1849-59) was much used.
