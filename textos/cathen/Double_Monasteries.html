<h1>Double Monasteries</h1>  

<p>Religious houses comprising communities of both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, dwelling in contiguous establishments, united under the rule of one superior, and using one church in common for their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices. The reason for such an arrangement was that the spiritual needs of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> might be attended to by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the male community, who were associated with them more closely than would have been possible in the case of entirely separate and independent <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The system came into existence almost contemporaneously with monasticism itself, and like it had its origin in the East. Communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> gathered around religious founders in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and elsewhere, and from the life of <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> we learn many details as to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> under his rule and their relation to the male communities founded by him. Double <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, of which those of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> and his sister, Macrina, may be cited as examples, were apparently numerous throughout the East during the early centuries of monasticism. It cannot be stated with any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> when the system found its way into the West, but it seems probable that its introduction into Gaul may be roughly ascribed to the influence of Cassian, who did so much towards reconciling <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">Eastern monasticism</a> with Western <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a>, St. Aurelian, his successor, and St. Radegundis, of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, founded double monasteries in the sixth century, and later on the system was propagated widely by St. Columbanus and his followers. Remiremont, Jouarre, Brie, Chelles, Andelys, and <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> were other well-known examples of the seventh and eighth centuries. From Gaul the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> spread to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and also to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where it is said to have been introduced by St. Fructuosus in the middle of the seventh century. According to Yepes there were in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> altogether over two hundred double monasteries.

<p>Ireland presents only one known example &#151; Kildare &#151; but probably there were others besides, of which all traces have since been lost. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> most of the early foundations were double; this has been wrongly attributed by some writers to the fact that many of the Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were educated in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, where the system was then in vogue, but it seems more correct to ascribe it to the religious influence of the missionaries from <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, since the first double monastery in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was that of <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a> at Whitby, established under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>, and there is no evidence to show that either <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a> or <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a> was acquainted with the double organization in use elsewhere.Whitby was founded in the seventh century and in a short time <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> became covered with similar dual establishments, of which Coldingham, <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, Sheppey, Minster, <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a>, and Barking are prominent examples. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the only other country besides those already mentioned where double monasteries are known to have existed, they were not numerous, but <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> speaks of them as being found in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> (Ep. xi), and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> mentions one at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Hist. Eccl., IV, i). The <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> invasions of the ninth and tenth centuries destroyed the double monasteries of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and, when they were restored, it was for one sex only, instead of for a dual community. The system seems to have died out also in other countries at about the same time, and it was not revived until the end of the eleventh century when <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Robert of Arbrissel</a> inaugurated his reform at <a href="../cathen/06129b.htm">Fontevrault</a> and gave the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> a fresh lease of life. It is not surprising to find that such a system was sometimes abused, and hence it was always an object of solicitude and strict legislation at the hands of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Many synodal and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees recognized its dangers, and ordered the strictest surveillance of all communications passing between <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Too close proximity of buildings was frequently forbidden, and every precaution was taken to prevent any occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Very probably it was this scant favour shown by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards it that caused the gradual decline of the system about the tenth century.

<p>In many double monasteries the supreme rule was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were subject to her authority. This was especially the case in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda's</a> at Whitby and <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda's</a> at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, though elsewhere, but more rarely, it was the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> who ruled both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and sometimes, more rarely still, each community had its own superior independent of the other. The justification for the anomalous position of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> acting as the superior of a community of men is usually held to originate from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words from the Cross, "Woman, behold thy son; Son, behold thy mother"; and it is still further urged that maternity is a form of authority derived from nature, whilst that which is paternal is merely legal. But, whatever may be its origin, the supreme rule of an <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> over both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was deliberately revived, and sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in two of the three <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> orders that consisted of double monasteries. At Fontevrault (founded 1099) and with the Bridgettines (1346), the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> was the superior of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, though with the Gilbertines (1146) it was the prior who ruled over both. In the earlier double monasteries both <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> observed the same rule <em>mutatis mutandis</em>; this example was followed by Fontevrault and the Bridgettines, the rule of the former being <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, while the latter observed the rule of St. Bridget. But with the Gilbertines, whilst the rule of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> was substantially <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> adopted that of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">BRIGITTINES</a>; FONTEVRAULT; GILBERTINES.) Little is known as to the buildings of the earlier double monasteries except that the church usually stood between the two conventual establishments, so as to be accessible from both. From excavations made on the site of Watton Priory, a Gilbertine house in Yorkshire, it appears that the separation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from canons was effected by means of a substantial wall, several feet high, which traversed the church lengthways, and it is probable that some similar arrangement was adopted in other double monasteries. No such communities exist at the present time in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>.
