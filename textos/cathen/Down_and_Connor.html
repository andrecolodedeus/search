<h1>Down and Connor</h1>  

<p>Diocese of Down and Connor (Dunensis et Connorensis)</p>

<p>A line drawn from Whitehouse on Belfast Lough due west to the Clady River, thence by the river itself to Muckamore and Lough Neagh, marks the boundary between the Diocese of Down and the Diocese of Connor. North of this line to the sea and the Bann, including the greater part of the County Antrim and a small portion of Derry, is the Diocese of Connor. South of the line, the remainder of Antrim, except the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Aghalee, belonging to <a href="../cathen/05160a.htm">Dromore</a>, belongs to the Diocese of Down, as also the whole of the County Down, except the baronies of Iveagh and part of Kinelearty. The extent of the united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is 597,450 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> acres (about 576 sq. Miles).

<p>Each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was a collection of ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Within the limits of Down, and founded in <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> time, there were: Raholp, founded by <a href="../cathen/14663a.htm">St. Tassach</a>, Gortgrib by Vinoch, Bright by Loarn, Mahee Island by St. Mochay, Moghera by St. Donard. There were also: Moville, founded by St. Finnian, and Bangor by <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>, the later an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but often ruled in aftertimes by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. St. Fergus is named as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down. In ancient times the place was called Dun Celtair, Celtair being one of the Red Branch <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>. Afterwards it was called Dun-da-Leth-Glaisse, "the fort of the two half-chains". According to tradition, two young chiefs had long pined in King Laeghaire's <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> struck off the chain which bound them, and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, thus released, hastened to their father's residence at Dun Celtair, flinging from them the pieces of the severed chain; hence the new name. A further change occurred after <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> death. Dying at Saul (493), he was buried at Down, which then contained no church. Subsequently the remains of St. Brigid were brought there from Kildare, as were some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Columba from <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>. Meanwhile the ancient Dun Celtair had become Downpatrick, a town overshadowing all the neighboring towns, the capital also of the Diocese of Down, which in process of time absorbed all the surrounding <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>.

<p>Like Down, <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>, founded in 480 by St. Macnisse, was a collection of smaller <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. These were Kilroot, Drumtullagh, Culfeightrim, Coleraine, Inispollen, Armoy, and Rashee. The date of the founding of each of these sees is uncertain, as also the dates of their absorption; nor can a regular succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be discovered. By the twelfth century all the sees had ceased to exist except Connor. Its western boundary then was the Roe; but by the synod of Rath-Breasail (1118), when the number and limits of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were fixed, the Bann was made the western boundary of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>, and Down was joined to it, but only for a brief period. In 1124 <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>; but when he resigned the primacy, in 1137, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down, again dividing the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. This separation was recognized by the Synod of Kells (1152), and continued till 1441, when John Cely, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down, was deprived for having violated his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity. Meanwhile the annals record the death of many distinguished men, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and others, connected with both <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. It is further recorded that in 831 Connor was plundered by the Danes, and Down in 942; that in 1177 Downpatrick was captured by John de Courcy, who <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; that in 1183 de Courcy turned the secular canons out of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and replaced them by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>; that in 1186 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, St. Brigid, and St. Combra were discovered there and reinterred in the church with great solemnity; that in 1315 a great battle was fought at Connor; and that the whole extent of the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> suffered grievously during the invasion of Edward Bruce.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> John Prene resisted the union of Down with Connor in 1441, and it did not finally take effect till 1451. Since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> both <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, recognized as one, have remained under the rule of one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. During the troubled times of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the O'Neills, the Ulster counties suffered much, though the old Faith was still maintained. But the plantation of Ulster replaced the greater number of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestants</a> and Scotch <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>. Later on, in the contests of the seventeenth century, the tide of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> frequently rolled over Antrim and Down, with consequent destruction of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> followed; and such was the combined effect of plantation and proscription that in 1670 in the whole of Down and Connor there were but 2500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. For nearly sixty years subsequently the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was ruled by vicars. When at length the pressure of penal legislation was removed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> revived rapidly. In the period from 1810 to 1840 no less than forty new <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches were built. The progress thus made under <a href="../cathen/04514c.htm">Dr. Crolly</a> (1825-1835) and Dr. Denvir (1835-65) was continued under Dr. Dorrian (1865-86) and Dr. MacAlister (1886-95); nor did any of his predecessors show greater energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> than Dr. Henry, whose death occurred with such tragic suddenness early in 1908. During the nineteenth century splendid churches were built at Newtownards, Hollywood, Balymoney, and Belfast, and on every side visible signs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> progress appeared.

<p>This prosperity is largely due to the rapid growth of Belfast. Situated on the shores of Belfast Lough, its site was occupied in the sixteenth century only by a strong castle, then in the hands of the O'Neills of Clannaboy. From them it passed at the close of the century to the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government, and in 1603 the castle and land adjoining were granted by King James to Sir Arthur Chichester. He laid out and planted a small town, which, in 1613, was made a corporation by royal charter. Its growth was slow, and during the seventeenth century it was entirely overshadowed by the neighboring town of Carrickfergus. About 1700, Belfast had a population of 2000, and a good deal of trade; in 1757 a population of 8000. Henceforth its rise was rapid and continuous. Its population in 1871 was 174,000; in 1881, 208,122; in 1891, 255,950; in 1901, with an enlarged city area, 348,876. It sends four members to Parliament, and is ruled by a lord mayor, fifteen aldermen, and forty-five councilors. In commerce and shipping, in trade and manufactures, it is the first city in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has more than kept pace with the general advance of the city. In 1708 there were but seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Belfast, and not till 1783 was there a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church. Belfast is now the episcopal seat, with ten city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, a flourishing <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. Among the remarkable men of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the following may be mentioned: St. Macnisse, the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of Down; <a href="../cathen/14663a.htm">St. Tassach</a>, who attended <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in his last illness; <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>, who founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor; St. Finnian, founder of Moville; St. Colman Ela, founder of Muckamore in Antrim; St. Mochay, Bishop on Nendrum; St. Donard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maghera; St. Dochona, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>. In the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Miler Magrath was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down and Connor; and in the next century the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="../cathen/11207a.htm">Cornelius O'Devanny</a>, and the fighting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/16058a.htm">Heber MacMahon</a>, who also met a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> fate.
