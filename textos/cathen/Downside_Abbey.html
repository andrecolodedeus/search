<h1>Downside Abbey</h1>  

<p>Near Bath, Somersetshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was founded at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai, Flanders</a>, under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, in 1605 by the <a href="../cathen/13098c.htm">Venerable John Roberts</a>, first prior, and some other <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had received the habit and taken <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation. In 1611 Dom Philip de Caverel, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint Vaast's at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the community in <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and consequently is revered as its founder. For some years the foundation was embroiled in attacks from without, and also in disputes as to a union with other <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, all of which were settled in 1633 by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Plantata" of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>.

<p>From the first a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> or college for lay pupils, sons of English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentry, has been an integral part of the institution. This undertaking, conducted on traditional English public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> lines, has always absorbed much of the energies of the community, whose other chief external work has consisted in supplying various missions or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. When Charles II established for his queen a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> royal at St. James's palace, the community to serve it was supplied from St. Gregory's at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and certain relics and church-plate then presented are still in existence at Downside. On the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was disbanded and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where they remained nearly two years. At length in March, 1795, they were allowed to proceed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where an asylum was supplied by Sir Edward Smythe, fifth Baronet, a former pupil, who lent his Shropshire seat of Acton Burnell to his old masters for use as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>., In 1814 the establishment was moved to Mount Pleasant, Downside, a small manor-house with sixty-six acres of land, bought for &#163;7000, largely the savings of the economy of the previous nineteen years. In 1823 <a href="../cathen/02207d.htm">Dr. Baines</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District, proposed to the community that they should abandon the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state and become a kind of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> under himself. This extraordinary suggestion being rejected, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> applied to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the ground of some alleged flaw in its canonical erection; after much litigation the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> on every point. Since then the establishment has increased steadily in size and importance, new buildings being added in 1823, 1853, and almost continually since 1870. In 1899 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> raised the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> to abbatial rank, the forty-fifth prior, Dom Edmund Ford, being elected first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, on whose resignation in 1906, Dom Cuthbert Butler was chosen to succeed him.

<p>Six <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Gregory's have died <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and are already pronounced Venerable, viz. <a href="../cathen/06536a.htm">Dom George Gervaise</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> 1608; <a href="../cathen/13098c.htm">Dom John Roberts</a>, the first prior, 1610; Dom Maurus Scot, 1612; Dom Ambrose Barlow, 1641; <a href="../cathen/12330a.htm">Dom Philip Powell</a>, 1646; and <a href="../cathen/12075b.htm">Brother Thomas Pickering</a>, 1679. Besides these the community has given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> three <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Dom Bede Polding</a> and <a href="../cathen/15315a.htm">Dom Bede Vaughan</a>, the first two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, New South Wales; and <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Dom Bernard Ullathorne</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a> and titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03125d.htm">Cabasa</a>, well known as an <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer. Also six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Dom Philip Ellis, Dom Laurence York, and Dom Gregory Sharrock, all three successively Vicars Apostolic of the Western District; more recently Dom Placid Morris, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Maritius and for many years assistant to <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>; Dom Joseph Brown, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Newport and Menevia; and Dom Charles Henry Davis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09555b.htm">Maitland</a>, New South Wales. From many other notable names may be mentioned <a href="../cathen/04486b.htm">Dom Serenus Cressy</a>, author of the "Church History of Brittany"; <a href="../cathen/07511a.htm">Dom John Huddlestone</a>, who was instrumental in saving Charles II after <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and reconciled him to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on his death-bed; the Abbot Sweeney, the well-known preacher; Dom Jerome Vaughan, founder of the Abbey of Fort Augustus, N. B.; Dom Aidan Gasquet the historian, Abbot President of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and also head of the Pontifical Commission for the revision of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. Among the alumni of St. Gregory's School, though not <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the community, were <a href="../cathen/15539b.htm">Bishop Charles Walmesley</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Dr. Carroll the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, U.S.A.; John Steevens, editor of Dugdale's "Monasticon"; Henry Carey, author of "God save the King"; Sir John Day, one of the best known English judges; and Bishop Patrick J. Donahue, of <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, U.S.A.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> buildings now consist of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for about fifty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> buildings for 1340 boarders; guest-house, the original building bought in 1814; and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, for exterior view of which see T<font size=-2>HE</font> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA,</font> I, 14. The last-named building consists at present of <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, choir, and fifteen side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> only; it is 230 feet long, and 70 feet high internally Even in its unfinished state it ranks as one of the finest modern Gothic buildings in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunket</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. The community numbers eighty-four choir <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; there are no <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. About half the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> work on the twenty-two missions or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in various parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which are dependent on the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, Downside has two other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Ealing, London, W, and at Gorey, Co. Wexford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; a house of studies for its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a> and another for students in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, near the British Museum. The "Downside Review", a periodical now in its twenty-eighth year, devoted chiefly to local, monastic, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> interests, and in which are many articles of value, is published every four months. The "Downside Masses" and "Downside Motets" indicate the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey's</a> interest in the revival of polyphonic music; a similar interest in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> being shown in the "Downside Prints", a series of small devotional pictures reproduced from ancient masters. Attached to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> are the titular Abbacies of Glastonbury and <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Bath, Coventry, and <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>. The arms of Downside are: Or a cross moline gules; the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> seal bears an effigy of <a href="../cathen/13046c.htm">Bl. Richard Whiting</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the neighbouring Abbey of Glastonbury.
