<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Droit de Regale</h1>  

<p>(<em>jus regali&oelig;, jus regale, jus deportus;</em> German <em>Regalienrecht</em>)

<p>Droit de Regale originally denoted those <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> that belonged exclusively to the king, either as essential to his sovereignty (<em>jura majora, jura essentialia</em>), such as royal authority; or accidental (<em>jura minora, jura accidentalia</em>), such as the right of the chase, of fishing, mining, etc. By abuse, many sovereigns in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and in later times claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to seize the revenues of vacant sees or imperial <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and gradually <em>jus regali&oelig;</em> came to be applied almost exclusively to this assumed right, It is a matter of dispute on what ground the temporal rulers claimed these revenues. Some hold that it is an inherent right of sovereignty; others, that it is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence of the right of investiture; others make it part of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system; still others derive it from the advowson, or right which patrons or protectors had over their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Ultimately, it had its origin in the assumption that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and imperial <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, with all their temporalities and privileges, were royal estates given as fiefs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and subject to the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the times. At first the right was exercised only during the actual vacancy of a see or <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but later it was extended over the whole year following the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Often the temporal rulers also claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to collate all the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> that became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> during the vacancy of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with the exception of those to which the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was attached.

<p>It is difficult to determine when and where the <em>jus regale</em> was first exercised. In the Western <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire it made its first appearance probably towards the end of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty, that is, in the course of the tenth century. The first historical mention we find of it is in connexion with King William II (Rufus) of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who, after the death of <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> in 1089, kept the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> vacant for more than three years, during which period the king seized all the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> revenues. During the reign of Henry II (1154-89) it had become an established practice for the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to take possession of the revenues of all vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not recognize the right is manifest from the fact that <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> condemned article 12 of the Council of Clarendon (1164), which provided that the king was to receive, as of seigniorial right (<em>sicut dominicos</em>), all the income (<em>omnes reditus et exitus</em>) of a vacant <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, abbacy, or <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> in his dominion (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXI, 1195). In 1176 Henry II promised the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Legate never to exercise the right of regalia beyond one year. With the exception of a few short periods, the right continued to be exercised by the English kings until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Even at present the English Crown exercises it over the temporalities of vacant (<a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>) <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> Henry V (1106-25), Conrad III (1138-52), and Frederic I (1155-89) are known as the first to have claimed it. Frederic I exercised it in its utmost rigour and styles it "an ancient right of kings and emperors" (Lacomblet, "Urkundenbuch f&uuml;r die Geschichte des Niederrheins", I, 288). King Philip of Suabia reluctantly renounced it, together with the <em>jus spolii</em> to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1203 (Mon. Germ.: Const. II, 9). Otho IV did the same in 1209 (ibid., 37). King Frederic II renounced it to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, first at Eger, on 12 July, 1213 (ibid., 58, 60), then in the Privilege of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, in May, 1216 (ibid., 68), and again to <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, at Hagenau, in September, 1219 (ibid., 78). In 1238 he began to exercise it anew (ibid., 285), but only during the actual vacancy of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, not for a whole year, as he had done previously. After the death of Frederic II the claims of the German Emperors to this right gradually ceased. At present the revenues of vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> go to the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>; in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, to the "Religionsfond".

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> we find the first mention of it during the reign of Louis VII, when, in 1143, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> complains, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the king had extended the <em>droit de r&eacute;gale</em> over a whole year (ep. 224, P. L, CLXXXII, 392). <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a>, in his famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/02112c.htm">"Ausculta fili"</a>, of 5 December, 1301, urged <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> to renounce it, but without avail. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the right did not belong exclusively to the king: it was also exercised by the Dukes of Normandy, Bretagne, and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and by the Counts of Champagne and Anjou. Entirely exempt from it were the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical provinces</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, Narbonne, Arles, <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, Embrun, and Vienne, The <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (1274) forbade anyone, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to extend the <em>jus regali&oelig;</em> over any diocese which was at that time exempt from it (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXIV, 90), and in 1499 Louis XII gave strict orders to his officials not to exercise it over exempt <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Towards the end of the sixteenth century the restriction of the Council of Lyons began to be disregarded, and on 24 April, 1608, the Parliament decided that the king had the <em>droit de r&eacute;gale</em> over all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; but Henry IV did not carry this parliamentary decision into effect. On 10 February, 1673, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> issued a declaration, extending the <em>droit de r&eacute;gale</em> over all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Parliament was pleased, and most <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> yielded without serious protest, only Pavilion, of Alet, and <a href="../cathen/03458b.htm">Caulet</a>, of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, resisting. These at first sought redress through their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, but when the latter took the king's side they appealed, in 1677, to <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. In three successive Briefs the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> urged the king not to extend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that had previously been exempt. The General Assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> held at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1081-2 aided with the king, and, despite the protests of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>, the right was maintained until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> attempted to restore it in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 6 November, 1813, but his downfall in the following year frustrated his plan. In 1880 the Third Republic again asserted the right, overstepping even the limits of its former application.
