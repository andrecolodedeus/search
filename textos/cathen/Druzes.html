<h1>Druzes</h1>  

<p>Small <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for their opposition to the Marionites, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people dwelling on the slopes of the Lebanon. Their name is derived as a plural form of <em>Dorazy</em>, the proper name of a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> at the court of El Hakim in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (about 1015). They subsequently repudiated all connection with this Mohammed Ibn Ismail el-Dorazy, and styled themselves <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a>, or <em>Muwahhedin</em>, on account of the emphasis they lay on the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Their history begins with the arrival of Dorazy in the Wady el-Teim, after his flight from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. This Persian had had the audacity to read to a large multitude in a mosque a book tending to prove that El Hakim, the mad Fatimite caliph, was an incarnation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Escaping from the crowd, who were enraged at this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, he fled to the valley between <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Hermon</a> and the Southern Lebanon, and with the support of his master preached his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to these mountaineers, already given to Batenite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and therefore predisposed to accept a further incarnation of the Deity. He was soon superseded by another Persian, Hamzeh Ibn Ahmed El Hady, who became the real founder of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and the author of its sacred books. After the assassination of El Hakim, Hamzeh wrote a treatise to prove that El Hakim had not really died but only disappeared to test the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his followers. This disappearance and ultimate return of El Hakim are the cardinal points of the Druze <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> today. The sacred books of the Druzes, successfully hidden from the world for eight centuries, have since the middle of the last century found their way into <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. They are written in Arabic and effect the style of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>. They consist of six volumes containing 111 treatises of a controversial character or explanatory epistles to individual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Each book takes its name from its first treatise. Their speculations strongly reflect their Persian origin.

<p>The Druze <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is characterized by its abstraction from all <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>; these, it declares, would imply limitation in the Supreme Being. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, manifested Himself first in the Universal Mind, then in the Universal Soul, and again in the Word. These three form the first great manifestation. The second great manifestation began with the residence of the Universal mind in Adam for a thousand years; after which Enoch took his place, and in turn was followed by the seven <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Abraham, Moses, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, Ibn Ishmail; the seventh is unknown. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appeared ten times in human form, for the last time in El Hakim. The Druzes teach a distinction between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the son of Joseph, and the Christ. Christ instructed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but finally <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> disobeyed Christ and was crucified in consequence. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was concealed under the form of one of the disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, stole the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the grave, and gave out the report that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had risen, in order that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Druzes might be concealed for awhile in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Jesus</a>. The Druzes are firm believers in the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and this transmigration will never end; after the Judgment Day death will continue, but it will be painless for the saved, who will live to the age of 120 years, and whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will forthwith be reborn and re-enter a life of peace and pleasure. The Druze are unshakably convinced that the whole of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> is peopled with adherents of their religion. The Judgment Day, or rather the golden age for the Druzes, will be at hand when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> wax greater than the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, some nine hundred years after the disappearance of El Hakim. Then the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, aided by the King of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, a sort of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> named "The Antagonist", will march against the Caaba in <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>. The hosts of Christ and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> will meet, but only to be both overcome by 2,500,000 Chinese Druzes. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> will both be reduced to everlasting slavery, and the <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a> will reign forever. The Druze religion contains several moral <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren, forsaking of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, repudiation of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, acknowledgement of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> unity at all times, secrecy in religion, and resignation to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The Druzes are divided into two main classes: the Ukkal, or initiated, and the Juhhal, or uninitiated; among the former the Iwayid profess the strictest Druze principles. They meet on Thursday evenings for worship, which consists almost exclusively in reading their sacred books. They often comply with the outward observances of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> and even make pretense of being <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, but they are officially designated as unbelievers. They live mostly ion the Lebanon, but are also found in the Hauran and in the districts near Damascus; their total number is estimated at 100,000 or a few thousand more. Encouraged by <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authorities, the Druze in 1860 attacked the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Marionites, and are said to have massacred some then thousand of them. The massacres were stayed mainly through English and French intervention.
