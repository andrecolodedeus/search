<h1>Dublin</h1>  

<p>(DUBLINIUM; DUBLINENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a>; occupies about sixty miles of the middle eastern coast of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and penetrates inland, about forty-six miles, including all the County of Dublin, nearly all of Wicklow, and parts of Kildare and Wexford, with three suffragans: Kildare and Leighlin, <a href="../cathen/06045a.htm">Ferns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>. It covers an area of 698,277 statute acres.

<p>Ptolemy, who flourished in the first half of the second century, on his famous map places <em>Eblana civitas</em> under the same parallel of latitude as the present city of Dublin. The first mention of <em>Duibhlinn</em> in any extant <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chronicles is found in the "Annals of the Four Masters", under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 291, where the name, which in English signifies a black pool, is quoted as that of a river on the bank of which a battle was fought by the King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> against the Leinstermen. A river still empties into the Liffey at Dublin, now known as the Poddle River, but formerly designated the Pool or Pole, clearly a survival of the earlier Black-Pool. The natives distinguished the locality as <em>Ath-Cliath</em>, i.e. "The Ford of Hurdles", from the wicker bridge or ford by which the great road from Tara was conducted across the Liffey into Cualann (South County Dublin and Wicklow).

<p>In 852, when Aulaf (Olaf) the Dane invaded <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and subjected all the contending tribes of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, he erected a fortress on the triangle of elevated land formed by the confluence of the Duibhlinn with the Liffey, a site now occupied by Dublin Castle. This fortress, taking its name from the river over which it stood, was called in Scandinavian <em>Dyflin</em>. In Anglo-Norman charters of the time of Henry II it became <em>Duvelina</em>; the legal scribes of King John brought it nearer to the name Dublin, which it has ever since retained. The fortress once established, there is no difficulty in imagining a town or city growing up and clustering around it, which after some time was furnished with a defensive wall, some remnants of which are yet visible.
<h2>Early Christian history</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> was preached in this territory, first by <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> and then by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. The stay of <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was very short, scarcely a year, yet during that brief space he established three <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, <em>Teach-Renan</em> (Tigroney), and Donard in County Wicklow, with <em>Ceille-Finne</em> in County Kildare. When the death of <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> was known at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 431, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> was immediately selected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for this <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission. To him, therefore, thenceforth regarded as the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the See of Dublin looks as to its founder. His first visit after brief landings at Wicklow, Malahide, and Holmpatrick, was to his old slave-master in the northern parts of the country. But so soon as he was able to gain the sanction of Leoghaire, King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to preach the Gospel throughout the land, he visited every part of the island and made innumerable converts. At Kilcullen, in the Dublin Diocese, he established a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and another at Lusk; while there are few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the diocese that do not lay claim to a visit from him. Soon after his death in 492, the monastic system, which <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> had himself partly initiated, became the settled form of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organisation in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The number of tribes into which the country was divided, and the fierce inter-tribal jealousy that prevailed at all times, rendered this system the more desirable. Each tribe had its own monastic establishment with a portion of the tribe lands set apart for its endowment, and in most of these centres a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was to be found, frequently (but not necessarily) the ruler of the community. It was in such establishments that the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> was centred. In this way we meet mention from time to time of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Kilcullen, Lusk, Swords, Finglas, Glendalough, Taney, Clondalkin, Castledermot, and Bray. We have no existing records and but scant traditions of any monastic establishment known as <em>Duibhlinn</em>; but a tribe did lie scattered along the valley of the Coombe, which may have taken its name, as did the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> fortress later on, from the <em>Duibhlinn</em> which meandered through its midst. The old church-dedications, which were certainly Celtic, of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, Bridget, <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a>, and MacTaill in this very neighbourhood, would point to such a conclusion. Such a tribe would undoubtedly have had its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with its resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If this surmise be correct, it would help to explain a list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> given in Harris's edition of Ware's "Antiquities of Ireland", and described as Bishops of Dublin; whilst from the invariable practice they all seem to have adopted, of embarking in some foreign missionary enterprise, they can scarcely be regarded as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the accepted sense of the term, i.e. as <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> wedded to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>.

<p>The first of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that we meet with is St. Livinus. He travelled into <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where he converted many, and was at length <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, 12 November, 663, in which month his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated. To him succeeded Disibod, who being driven out by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and after forty years labour in the neighbourhood of Disibodenberg named after him, died a very holy death. He flourished about 675. St. Wiro is next. He emulated the example of Livinus and passed over into Gaul. The at the request of Pepin of Heristal, he established himself about 700 at <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">Roermond</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, where a portion of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> is preserved under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dedicated to him. St. Gualafer is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the eighth century, but of him nothing is known except that he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> and instructed his successor, who figures more conspicuously. St. Rumold was certainly Irish-born, and reputed to have been some time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dublin. He cherished an ardent desire for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and setting out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> there received the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> blessing. On his return journey he preached at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success. Having had occasion to rebuke certain <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">public sinners</a>, he met at their hands the longed-for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. He is the patron of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, whose splendid <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to him, and his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved there in a sumptuous silver shrine. St. Sedulius, who died in 785, is given by some writers as "Bishop of Dublin", by others as "Abbot of Dublin". In all probability he filled both offices. In or about 890 there is mention of Cormac as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Ware could learn nothing about him. D'Alton says he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when Gregory, King of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, besieged and captured Dublin.


<h2>Danish period</h2>

<p>The year 815 is commonly assigned as the date when Scandinavian invaders began to make permanent settlements in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Hitherto their repeated visits had been mere piratical expeditions. They landed, plundered, and departed. But that year Turgesius and his followers came to stay. The "Annals of the Four Masters" tell us that in 849 the <em>Duibhgoill</em> or "black foreigners" arrived at <em>Ath Cliath</em> and made a great slaughter of the <em>Finngoill</em> or "white foreigners". In 850 the former gained a still more decisive victory. Finally in 852 Aulaf (Olaf) invaded <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, "and all the foreign tribes submitted to him". Thus was founded the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> city and kingdom of Dublin. Aulaf was succeeded by Ivar in 870, and as the latter was at the same time King of Northumbria, this dual sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> kings of Dublin was with occasional brief interruptions maintained throughout a period of nearly a century and a half. <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> was of course the cult of these rude Norsemen. They sedulously practised the worship of Thor and Woden, and thus during a great portion of their prolonged rule in Dublin its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> history becomes a blank, varied at intervals by doleful recitals of the burning and plundering of celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, such as Glendalough, Lusk, Swords, Clondalkin, etc. The first of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> kings to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was Sitric, who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and married King Athelstan's daughter in 925. But he very soon <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the Faith, abandoned his wife, and died a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. His son, however, Aulaf Cuarann, on visiting <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was there converted in 943, and received at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by King Edmund. He remained firm in the Faith, and going to <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in 980, died there "after penance and a good life". It was the conversion of this Aulaf and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, aided by the efforts of Northumbrian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom he had brought over with him, that led to the conversion of the Danes of Dublin which chroniclers assign to 948.

<p>The great victory won by King Brian Boru on the plain of Clontarf in 1014 broke for ever the power of the Danes in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but it did not dispossess them of Dublin. Their kings continued to rule there for a century and a half; nevertheless, the completeness of the victory, together with the civilising effects of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, disposed the contending races to more friendly intercourse, and enabled Celt and Dane henceforward to live tog ether in comparative peace. In 1038, little more than twenty years after the battle of Clontarf, we find another King Sitric (II) at Dublin, who, seeing that his subjects had all become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, was moved to organise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on a proper hierarchical basis. Wherefore in that year he founded and endowed a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> (since Queen Elizabeth's time appropriated to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> worship and known as Christ Church). To minister in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; with this first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Dublin, the See of Dublin may be said to have been formally founded. Having received their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from Northumbria, the Danes looked to Canterbury for their spiritual government; and had their first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Donatus, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Except in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and general discipline they were in no way identified with the rest of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<p>Donatus died in 1074 and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, who bore commendatory letters to <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by him in St. Paul's, London. After ruling the diocese for about ten years he perished at sea in 1084. Donat O'Haingly, evidently an Irishman, came next. He was a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. By consent of the king and of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Dublin he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> in 1085. He died of the plague in 1095. To him succeeded his nephew Samuel O'Haingly, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> by Saint Anselm on the <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Sunday after Easter</a>, 1096, and died in 1121. It was to this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> that <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> administered the sharp rebuke for having removed the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from his church, from which we may infer that it was at this period that a chapter of secular canons was established in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> having been previously monastic. Gregory was chosen as successor. He is described as a wise man and well skilled in languages. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Lambeth by Ralph, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>.
<h2>Twelfth-century reforms</h2>

<p>During Gregory's incumbency great and far-reaching changes were wrought in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organisation of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Up to this time, except in the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> towns of Dublin, Waterford, and Limerick, the old system of centring <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the clan with a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resident, almost universally prevailed, but Gillebert (Gilbert), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, who had travelled much, and had made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, received a strong letter from the latter exhorting him to do his utmost, in union with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to reform certain abuses and bring the system of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government more into conformity with the prevailing practice of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Whereupon Gillebert having received legatine powers from Paschal II convoked a synod which met at Rath-Breassail in 1118. At this synod the number of sees was fixed at twenty-four, Dublin excluded. Glendalough, the church founded by <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">St. Kevin</a> in the sixth century, was definitely erected into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> See of Dublin was ignored, or if referred to, it is described a being in the <a href="../cathen/06582b.htm">Diocese of Glendalough</a>, for the latter came up to the very walls of Dublin and surrounded them on all sides. <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a> about 1127, followed up the work of Gillebert, and on the occasion of a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, besought <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> to constitute the Bishops of Armagh and Cashel <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and transmit the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to them. Before his request could be fully considered, Malachy on a second journey fell sick on the way, and died at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> in the arms of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (1148). The object of his journey, however, was not lost sight of, and in 1151, <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> commissioned Cardinal Paparo to proceed to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and establish there four <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, giving him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">palliums</a> with which each was to be invested. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on his arrival convoked a general synod at <a href="../cathen/08615a.htm">Kells</a> in 1152. At this synod Armagh, Dublin, <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, and Tuam, were created <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal sees</a>, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">canonical jurisdiction</a> over their suffragans, and each of the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. In this way Gregory became the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Dublin, and had assigned to him as suffragans the Sees of Kildare, <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, Leighlin, <a href="../cathen/06045a.htm">Ferns</a>, and Glendalough In a document drawn up by the then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, in 1214 the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> is described as finding on his arrival in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> dwelling in Dublin, who at the time exercised his episcopal office within the walls. "He found in the same Diocese another church in the mountains, which likewise had the name of a city [Glendalough] and had a certain <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a></em>. But he delivered the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to Dublin which was the best city and appointed that the diocese [Glendalough] in which both these cities were should be divided, and that one part thereof should fall to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>." This severed the North County Dublin known as Fingall, from Glendalough Diocese and annexed it to Dublin. Thus was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> reorganised in strict hierarchical form, and all dependence upon Canterbury was brought to an end.

<p>Archbishop Gregory died in 1161 and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>. To him succeeded Lorcan (latinized <em>Laurentius</em>) O'Toole, son of Muriartach, Prince of Imaile. His mother was an O'Byrne, so that he was <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. Entrusted at an early age to the care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Glendalough he grew up a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and exemplary youth and eventually became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> there. When but twenty-five years old he was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and a few years later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This choice, however, he successfully withstood. But his resistance did not long avail him. As soon as the See of Dublin was vacated both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people turned their eyes on the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Glendalough and would not be refused. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Dublin <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by Gelasius of Armagh in 1162. His first act was to induce the canons of his chapter to become canons regular according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Aroasia. He himself assumed the religious habit with them and scrupulously conformed to the rule. He was indefatigable in his work and boundless in his charity. In 1167 he attended a great convention held at Athboy at the request of King Roderic O'Conor, and helped there to enact several decrees affecting <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. In the following year the ill-starred Dermot MacMurrough set out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to negotiate the betrayal of his country. In 1169 the first expedition of the Anglo-Normans landed in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and Wexford and Waterford soon fell before them. They then marched on Dublin, and in this expedition Strongbow was joined by the army of Dermot. Hasculf, the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> king, made a sturdy defence, but eventually the city was captured and Hasculf and his followers escaped to their ships. In 1171 they returned with a number of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a> collected at Orkney and the Isles, and attacked the eastern gate of the city. St. Laurence implored King Roderic to come to their aid; the latter did assemble an army, but their operations were ineffective, and the grip of the Norman fastened on Dublin, never again to be relaxed. King Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> landed this same year, and received at Dublin the fealty of most of the native princes. Thenceforward <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> became an appendage of the English Crown.

<p>Early in the following year a synod was held in Cashel by order of Henry, at which Laurence assisted and where among other disciplinary regulations, the system of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was introduced, as is commonly believed. With the aid of Strongbow and other Norman chiefs he was enabled to enlarge and beautify Christ Church, i.e. <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> and one bay of the choir remain to this day evidences of his work. In 1177 Cardinal Vivian arrived in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, summoned a meeting of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and inculcated obedience to the conquerors. In 1179 Archbishop Laurence went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to attend the Third General Council of the Lateran under <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received him with marked kindness, took his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> under his protection, confirmed its possessions, and extended its boundaries on the south as far as Bray. He also appointed him his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Some time in 1180 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> again crossed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the purpose of interviewing King Henry in the interests of his people, but Henry had no wish to see him and fled into <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. Laurence, nothing daunted, quickly pursued him, but had scarcely landed on the Norman coast when he fell seriously ill. He asked to be brought to the community of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> established at Eu, and there died peacefully 14 November, 1180. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonised</a> by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> in 1226, and his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, being transferred, were placed over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in a costly shrine where they are still devoutly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in Dublin each recurring 14 November with great pomp and solemnity, and a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church in a city is specially dedicated to him.
<h2>Norman-English archbishops</h2>

<p>With the passing of St. Laurence, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> character of the newly constructed <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, as far as Dublin was concerned was brought to a premature close. The conquerors brought with them a colony of <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a> men and settled them in Dublin, and also brought all their <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> privileges and customs, prominent among which was the right of the English monarch to nominate to vacant sees within his dominion, this with the concurrence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the exercise of this prerogative, Henry II named John Comyn, an Englishman, as successor to Laurence O'Toole. Henceforward, for full four centuries, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was occupied by an unbroken line of twenty-five <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, all English men, born, bred, and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Comyn proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he was first <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and then <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by Lucius III at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>. He did not take up his residence in Dublin until 1184. The king conferred additional lands upon him to be held in barony tenure, by virtue of which he became a Lord of Parliament. In 1185 he received Prince John on his landing in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and in the same year the <a href="../cathen/06582b.htm">Diocese of Glendalough</a> was united to Dublin; this union, however, was not to take effect until after the death of the governing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, William Piro. In 1186 he assembled a provincial synod in Christ Church <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at which several important canons were enacted. In 1190 he undertook the work of building a new church just outside the city wall. He erected it on the site of an old Celtic church dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, but preserved the original dedication and opened it with great solemnity on Patrick's Day, 1191. In connection with this church he founded and endowed a collegiate chapter of thirteen canons and erected an episcopal residence close by, which became known as St. Sepulchre's.

<p>Archbishop Comyn died in 1212 and was succeeded by Henry de Loundres, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Stafford. Two years later William Piro, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Glendalough, died, whereupon the union of the sees promised by King John took place. De Loundres's principal work was the conversion of the collegiate chapter established by his predecessor in connection with St. Patrick's, into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, with four dignities and an increased number of <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>. This change presented the singular spectacle of a city having two <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, with two chapters, one monastic, the other secular, an arrangement which fed to a good deal of friction and gave much trouble to succeeding <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. In 1228 de Loundres was succeeded by Archbishop Luke, brought over from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Flourishing as he did in the period of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> building, we need not be surprised to learn that he caught the infection, and practically re-erected St. Patrick's as we have it today, and put the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> to Christ Church as we see it in its restored condition. It scarcely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to go through nominatim the series of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a>. Suffice it to mention, that as most of them held some government post, such as lord chancellor, or lord treasurer, in conjunction with the arch-bishopric, their spiritual influence was thereby rendered obnoxious to the native clans of the O'Byrnes and O'Tooles, when they shook off the English yoke during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, not to leave the natives without episcopal care, was compelled to provide a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for them, titularly of Glendalough, and the <em>rubricelle</em> in the Vatican Library furnish a list of six such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who presided over the mountainous region of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> well into the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>.
<h2>The Anglican schism</h2>

<p>This monarch, unhappily as is well known, dislocated everything in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The foul <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Archbishop Alan, author of the valuable "Liber Niger" and "Repertorium Viride", by the followers of Silken Thomas in 1534, afforded the king the much desired opportunity of introducing his religious vagaries into <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He kept the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> vacant for nearly a year, and then filled it without any reference to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by the appointment of George Browne. Browne had been <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the suppressed <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and was the bond slave of Henry, ready to do his master's bidding. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Cranmer, 19 March, 1535-6, and took up his residence in Dublin in August, 1536. The antecedents of Browne and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> character of his appointment did not recommend him to the Dublin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He complained of their resistance to his injunctions and was compelled to send round his own servants in order to cancel the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name in the service-books. A sharp warning from the king stirred him up to more demonstrative action, and forthwith he had all <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">holy relics</a> preserved in Christ Church <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, including <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> known as the "Staff of Jesus", gathered into a heap and burned. He co-operated only too gladly in the suppression of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, in changing the prior and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Christ Church into a secular dean and chapter, and in the total suppression of St. Patrick's chapter. Under Edward VI he introduced that monarch's new liturgy, as found in his first "Book of Common Prayer", into the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and finished by taking a wife.

<p>With the accession of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> all things <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were restored, and Browne, being convicted of being a married <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was deposed. The queen filled the vacant see by nominating Hugh Curwen, Dean of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, yet another Englishman, and the royal <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was confirmed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. She also reestablished the dean and chapter of St. Patrick's. While the queen survived, unhappily not long, Curwen behaved as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but on the accession of Elizabeth, he was ready to worship the rising sun, to accept her royal supremacy and Act of Uniformity, and eventually a transfer to the See of Oxford as its <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This apostasy, coupled with the severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> which continued through the whole of Elizabeth's reign, left the See of Dublin without a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for full forty years. The compensations were, however, a firm and faithful <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, and a long roll of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors.
<h2>End of persecution</h2>

<p>Some attempt was made by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to provide a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1585 by appointing a certain Donald or Donatus, but he did not live to take possession, and not until 1600 was his successor appointed in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Matthew d'Oviedo, a Spanish <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>. Though he came to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he dared not set foot in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but governed it through vicars-general, three of whom successively ended their days in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Finally about 1611 d'Oviedo returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, being succeeded by Dr. Eugene Matthews, transferred from <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>. Dr. Matthews laboured hard and in most difficult times. In 1615 he called a provincial synod in Kilkenny wherein, amongst other enactments, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> system was reorganised and order evolved out of chaos. He narrowly escaped <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> more than once, and eventually betook himself to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he died in 1623. Early in 1625 his successor Dr. Thomas Fleming, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, was appointed. After the outbreak of 1641 and when the Confederation of Kilkenny was initiated, he was appointed a member of the supreme council and took part in its deliberations. But the arrival and victory of the Cromwellians in Dublin in 1649 closed the gates of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city against him; he took refuge in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> and died there in 1651 or 1652. <a href="../cathen/11293c.htm">Dr. Edmund O'Reilly</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, was proposed as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and subsequent exile rendered this proposal abortive, and in 1656 Dr. James Dempsey, <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> of Leighlin, was appointed to this office. In his first report to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, after the horrors of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, pestilence, and banishment, he states "that in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Dublin there were not enough <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to form three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>".

<p>The restoration of Charles II to the throne occurred during Dr. Dempsey's administration and would probably have resulted in some benevolent policy of toleration had not the intrigues of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, Peter Walsh, brought new troubles upon the suffering members of the Faith. The assembly of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> held in Dublin in 1666 at the instance of. Walsh and out manoeuvred by him, did not bring peace. Dr. Dempsey died in 1667, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was again vacant until 1669 when the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/14432c.htm">Dr. Peter Talbot</a> of the Malahide <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 2 May. In 1670 he held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, and a meeting of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was held in Dublin in the same year which furnished the occasion, by a claim for precedence, for the first contention between Armagh and Dublin concerning the primacy. In 1673 he was banished the kingdom; it was not until. 1677 when broken in health, that he was allowed to return; he was, however, immediately committed a close <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to Dublin Castle where after lingering for two years he died. He was a learned man and a prolific writer. In 1683 Dr. Patrick Russell, a native of the County Dublin, succeeded him. The advent of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> king raised the hopes of the afflicted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and with liberty restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they took heart to make a strong march forward. A provincial synod was assembled in 1685, another in 1688; in 1686 and 1689 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter, which had never died, was reorganised and the precedence of its members settled. Many other works were projected by Dr. Russell, but the disastrous defeat at the Boyne, in 1690, and the flight of King James put an end to all hope and reduced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to a worse condition than ever. Dr. Russell was apprehended and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he died in 1692. King James, still recognised by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, claimed the exercise of the royal prerogative of nominating to vacant sees; the claim being admitted, he named Peter Creagh, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Dublin. Dr. Creagh was an exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to govern through a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a>. He went himself as auxiliary to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> where he died in 1705. Of the six <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> who filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the seventeenth century, two could never set foot in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, two died in exile, and two in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> commenced their ferocious career (1705) <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was reduced to a single <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05160a.htm">Dromore</a>, and he was confined in Newgate Prison, Dublin. The new <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> sprang from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> cell. Therein was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (1707) Dr. O'Rorke, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08640a.htm">Killala</a>, and once established in the Apostolic office, he imposed hands on the newly chosen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Dublin, Dr. Edmund Byrne, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Nicholas.

<p>The population and extent of Dublin had been steadily increasing ever since the Restoration, and new quarters had grown up. Dr. Byrne's first care was to erect these into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. To him owe their origin St. Mary's, St. Paul's, and St. Andrew's. In 1710 the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a>, aimed against the Stuarts, but full of other objectionable matter, raised a new storm of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and Dr. Byrne for a time was forced to hide with his relatives in Kildare. With varying vicissitudes he continued to rule the diocese until his death in January, 1723-4. He was succeeded by Dr. Edward Murphy, transferred from Kildare. This <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> continued to date his letters, according to the well-known formula of hunted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: <em>e loco refugii nostri</em>, i.e. from our place of refuge. He died in 1729 and was followed by Dr. Luke Fagan, translated from <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, who died in 1734, and had for his successor Dr. John Linegar, a native of Dublin, who lived until 1757, when his coadjutor Dr. Richard Lincoln, also a native of the city, succeeded him. In 1763 he died, and was followed by Dr. Patrick Fitzsimon who governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until 1770, when Dr. John Carpenter succeeded. With him may be said to commence the modern history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, for he was the first of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, since Archbishop Alan's time, who left behind him, carefully compiled, detailed records of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He died on 29 October, 1786.
<h2>Restoration of Catholic life</h2>

<p>With a rapidity extraordinary for that time, Dr. John Thomas Troy, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, was transferred 9 December, 1786, from <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a> to the Archbishopric of Dublin. For thirty-seven years he governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Dublin well and wisely. He witnessed the first assertion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, took part in the foundation of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, and laid the foundation stone of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church in Marlborough Street, which still does <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as pro-cathedral. Archbishop Troy saw the beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a> and the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, while churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> multiplied under his eyes. He died in 1823 and was buried in the vaults of the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church not yet quite ready for use. His coadjutor, <a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Dr. Daniel Murray</a>, a native of Wicklow, succeeded him. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> in Salamanca, he was an eloquent, cultured, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ecclesiastic, described by his panegyrist as "the Francis de Sales of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>". To him belong the completion of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">pro-cathedral</a>, the founding of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Sisters of Charity and the communities of Loretto. He witnessed the achievement of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the wonderful career of the Liberator, Daniel O'Connell of the great temperance movement under Father Mathew, and the establishment of a system of national (primary) <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of which he himself was appointed a commissioner. The awakening of a nation and of a church to a new life and increased responsibilities was accomplished in his time. He died in 1852 regretted by all, and was buried in the Marlborough Street vaults, where in the church above them, a beautiful kneeling <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> by Sir Thomas Farrell, adorn the northern <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Archbishop Murray</a> was followed by <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Dr. Paul Cullen</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, who in June, 1852, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in Dublin. He founded the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital. He inaugurated innumerable new churches, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and became the recognised champion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> all the world over. In 1866 he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> first <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In 1870 he took a distinguished part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and in 1875 presided over the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">National Synod</a> of Maynooth. In 1878 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist at the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, but arrived late, and in October of that year passed to his reward. He is <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the college <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Clonliffe; a fine marble <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> perpetuates his memory in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">pro-cathedral</a>.

<p>In October, 1878, Dr. Edward McCabe, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> assistant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1877, was raised to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal office</a>. His administration was short. In 1882 Pope Leo conferred on him the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Never in very robust health, he died in February, 1885. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at Glasnevin where a handsome mausoleum is erected to his memory. In July, 1885, the Most Rev. William J. Walsh was appointed to succeed him.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are very well represented in Dublin by houses of Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Holy Ghost Fathers, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, Oblates, and <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>. Dublin is the residence of the Superior General of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a> and the seat of their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. Numerous sisterhoods, both within and without the city (Sisters of Charity, Mercy, Loretto, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Presentation, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, Holy Faith, Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, Assumption, Bon Secours, Poor Servants, Heart of Mary, etc.) devote themselves to the usual works of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and charity (<a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, asylums for the aged poor, for the blind and for deaf-mutes of both sexes, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, homes, refuses, lunatic asylums, etc.).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15199b.htm">Catholic University of Ireland</a>, founded in 1854, consists (since 1882) of the following (6) colleges located for the most part near Dublin: St. Patrick's College, Maynooth; University College, St. Stephen's Green (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>); University College, Blackrock (Holy Ghost Fathers); St. Patrick's College, Carlow; Holy Cross College, Clonliffe; and the School of Medicine, Dublin. Each of these colleges retains its own independent organisation. (For the history of this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> see CULLEN; MACHALE; NEWMAN; <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">IRELAND</a>.) Other colleges are conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (Belvedere College), the Holy Ghost Fathers (Rathmines), the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> (Terenure), and the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> (Castleknock). The Holy Cross College (Clonliffe) is the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> of St. Patrick's, Maynooth, see <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">MAYNOOTH COLLEGE</a>.

<p>By the New Universities Act passed in 1908, the official existence of the <a href="../cathen/15199b.htm">Catholic University of Ireland</a> was brought to a close. This Act suppressed the Royal University of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and created two new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, both strictly undenominational. One had its seat in Belfast, and absorbed the Queen's College already existing there; the other had its seat in Dublin, with a new college founded there, and absorbing the Queen's Colleges in <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> and <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>. The new Colleges of Dublin, <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, although undenominational under the Act, principally subserved <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, Dublin University (Trinity College) being left undisturbed and mostly frequented as well as governed by members of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Dublin is nominated, though not <em>ex officio</em>, a member of the Senate of the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> having a seat in Dublin, and also a member of the Statutory Commission charged by the Crown with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of revising and approving of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the several colleges comprised in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.
