<h1>Dubuque</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> of Dubuque (Dubuquensis), established, 28 July, 1837, created an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, 1893, comprises that part of <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> north of Polk, Jasper, Poweshiek, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, Johnson, <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">Cedar</a>, and Scott, and east of Kossuth, Humboldt, Webster, and Boone Counties; an area of 18,084 sq. miles. The city is picturesquely situated on the Mississippi, at the base of noble bluffs that rise 300 feet above the river; many of these eminences are <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions and fine residences. The city is named after Julien Dubuque, a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> who lived there from 1788 to 1811, mining lead and trading with the Indians. His grave was marked by a cross and recently has been adorned with a rugged round tower of native limestone.

<p>The first white men to visit <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> were <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Marquette and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Hennepin</a>. Later missionaries sent from Quebec laboured among the Indians of <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, and kept alive the Faith among the scattered pioneers. <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> became <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> territory by the Louisiana Purchase, and in 1883, after treaty with the Indians, was opened to settlement. The lead mines at Dubuque attracted many, and the fertile prairies many more, and the population increased rapidly. The earliest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers were French, German, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, coming directly from their native lands or from the Eastern States; soon the whole state was dotted with thriving villages and prosperous farms. The attitude of non-Catholics has been uniformly friendly; the coming of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the building of a church were generally met with favor and even with generous contributions. At present the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people of the Archdiocese of Dubuque are about equally divided between agriculture and urban pursuits, and hold a prominent position in social, business, and professional life. The principal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> outside the city of Dubuque presided over by irremovable rectors are Clinton, Cedar Rapids, Independence, Marshalltown, Waterloo, Dyersville, Mason City, Lansing, Ackley, Cascade, New Vienna, and Waukon.

<p>The diocese of Dubuque was created in 1837 by a division of that of St. Louis, and embraced the area north of <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and east of the Mississippi to the Missouri. One <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Samuel Mazzuchelli, ministered to a scattered population of less than 3000; three churches had been built; St. Raphael's at Dubuque, one in <a href="../cathen/04640a.htm">Davenport</a>, and one at Sugar Creek, Lee County. Today in that same territory the church numbers 1,000,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, a score of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and thousands of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious workers.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>(1) Pierre-Jean-Mathias Loras, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born in <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 30 August, 1792; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and uncle were guillotined during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Mathias, who had as a schoolmate the <a href="../cathen/08326c.htm">Blessed Cur&eacute; d'Ars</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 12 November 1815, and for years was superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Largentiere. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> led him in 1829 to <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> where he labored as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Sand Spring Hill until 1837. Consecrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dubuque, at <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, 10 December, 1837, by Bishop Portier of <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, he familiarized himself by letters with the needs of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for priests; he returned 21 April, 1839, with six men of heroic mould, whose names are inseparably linked with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> North-West: Joseph Cretin, who in 1851 was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, A. Ravoux, a noted Indian missionary, J.A.M.Pelamourgues, the patriarch-priest of <a href="../cathen/04640a.htm">Davenport</a>, L. Galtier, R. Petiot, and J. Causse, pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Minnesota. At Dubuque the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was received, 19 April, 1839, with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by all classes. His administration was marked by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and providential <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. He multiplied his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, encouraged immigration from the crowded cities of the East, welcomed the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> and various orders of sisters, chose and purchased tracts of land in the wilderness, that are now flourishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. He was constantly engaged in visitations and preaching missions. By personal example and formation of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, he advanced the cause of temperance. In his work the generosity of the people was supplemented by contributions from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In a letter of 1839 to the <a href="../cathen/12461a.htm">Society of the Propagation of the Faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, he acknowledged a gift of $10,500 for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1850 St. Bernard's <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened, which flourished for five years; among its students was <a href="../cathen/04403b.htm">Henry Cosgrove</a>, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04640a.htm">Davenport</a>. In 1854 Bishop Loras visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in quest of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1855 he requested and obtained as coadjutor the Rev. Clement Smyth, superior of the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> community at New Melleray. Bishop Loras died at Dubuque, 20 February, 1858. Where he found one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a scattered little flock, he left 48 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with 60 churches and 54,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.



<p>(2) Clement Smyth was b. 24 February, 1810, at Finlea, County Clare, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15057a.htm">Trinity College</a>, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 29 May, 1841. He was sent to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and founded New Melleray <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, twelve miles from Dubuque, on land donated by Bishop Loras. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 3 May, 1857, by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of St. Louis. Bishop Smyth was a man whose deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and boundless charity won the devotion of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people. He held a synod whose canons remained unaltered till 1902. Under him immigration continued, but owing to hard times and the Civil War, not much progress was made in church-building, but the spiritual edifice was strengthened. At his death, 22 September 1865, there were 90,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>.

<p>(3) Bishop Smyth was succeeded in 1866 by the Rt. Rev. John Hennessy, b. 20 August, 1825, in the County Limerick, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He entered Carondelet <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> near St. Louis, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1850. He became president of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and in 1858 was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as representative <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a>. From 1860 to 1866 he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph, Missouri. As a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he manifested extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, learning, and eloquence. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a>, at Dubuque, 30 Sept., 1866. Bishop Hennessy received many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and in 1873 founded St. Joseph's College and Theological Seminary in Dubuque. Existing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were systematically divided and he directed his energies especially to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Wherever possible <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were built and heroic <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were made that every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child should be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers. Considerable and continued opposition was offered by some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, not only for <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> reasons, but also because they considered the programme an attack on the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was shown by the prosperous condition of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, which at the time of his silver Jubilee, showed 12,257 pupils enrolled. Bishop Hennessy assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and was prominent in the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. In 1893 he was made first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Dubuque, with Davenport, <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14016b.htm">Sioux Falls</a> as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. His death occurred 4 March, 1900.

<p>(4) The Most Rev. John J. Keane, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, and Rector of <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>, was named to succeed Archbishop Hennessy, 24 July, 1900. Archbishop Keane was b. 12 Sept., 1839, at Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 2 July, 1866, at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 25 August, 1878. Synods in 1902, 1905, and 1908 applied the Baltimore decrees to local conditions. Conferences of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were held semi-annually in every deanery. Complete annual reports from every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> were made through the chancery. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for total abstinence founded an archdiocesan union, and in the field of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he encouraged postgraduate courses for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, doubled the faculty and buildings of St. Joseph's College, the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the archdiocese, which now enrolls 200 classical students, established a missionary band of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, welcomed the Sisters of the Good Shepherd and the Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, and the Brothers of Mary. Thus with indefatigable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he continued the work of his predecessors. In 1902 the western portion of the archdiocese was erected into the new <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Diocese of Sioux City</a>.

<p>Among the early missionaries and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were Rev. John McMahon, C.P. Fitzmaurice, Daniel Maloney, Maurice Flavin, John Shields, James O'Gorman, who became <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> at <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, M. Flannery, A.Hattneberger, H. Meis, Charles McGauran, John <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, T.M. Lenihan, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Cheyenne</a>, C. Johannes, Patrick McCabe, and T. Donahue. Prominent among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were: Charles Corkery, Postmaster under President Buchanan, Patrick Quigley, Gen. Geo. W.

Neuman, and David Hennessey.

<p>The Sisters of Charity of the B.V M. went to Dubuque in 1844 from Philadelphia. The mother-house is now located there and they conduct two academies and eleven <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in various centres, besides having sent communities to four other states. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> located in 1868 in <a href="../cathen/04640a.htm">Davenport</a>, and now have independent houses in Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, and Independence. The Presentation Nuns arrived from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1875, and have 65 members. The Visitation Nuns conduct an academy in Dubuque; they number 31 members. The Sisters of St. Francis came from <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and 320 of them are employed in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>.
