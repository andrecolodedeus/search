<h1>Duccio di Buoninsegna</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">Painter</a>, and founder of the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> School, b. about 1255 or 1260, place not known; d. 3 August, 1319. About this time <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> was at the zenith of her political power. She had just defeated Florence on the field of Montaperti (4 September, 1260), and an era of marvellous development followed this conquest. Then was begun the huge task of building the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where, in 1266, was commenced the incomparable <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> sculptured by <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicholas of Pisa</a>, and it was under these flourishing conditions that Duccio received his artistic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. However, he owed nothing to the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style nor to the naturalistic renaissance of <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicholas of Pisa</a>: he allied himself exclusively with Byzantine tradition. Duccio has been called the "Last of the Greeks", and his genius consisted in giving exquisite expression to the refined sentiment of the masters of Byzantium, discovering its original meaning despite the barbarous, hideous imitations made by a degenerate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>Duccio is first mentioned in 1278, when he was engaged upon minor work, such as <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> the coffers of the archives and the <em>tablettes</em> (memorandum-books) of the Biccherna, one of them for the year 1293 now in the Industrial Museum of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. But his great work at this time was the famous "Madonna de' Ruccellai" &#151; one of the most illustrious specimens of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> &#151; preserved at Florence in a side-chapel of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella and, on the authority of <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, so long considered one of <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue's</a> masterpieces. But that the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was Duccio's is now beyond question, as Milanesi has published the text of a contract drawn up for this picture, 15 April, 1285, between the artist and the rectors of the Confraternity of the Virgin. Although still hieratical and archaic, Duccio's "Madonna", when compared, for instance, with that of Guido of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1221 and shown today in the Palazzo Pubblico of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, seems fully to deserve its celebrity.

<p>But it was in 1311 that Duccio achieved his principal work, the glory of which is destined to remain traditional, the great reredos for the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. This panel, removed in the fifteenth century, may now be seen in the museum of the Opera del Duomo. The day of its installation was observed as a public feast; shops were closed and bells were rung and the people of the city, carrying lighted candles, solemnly escorted the picture from the artist's residence at the Porta Stalloreggi to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. This <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was indeed a national masterpiece and in this regard is comparable only to the reredos by <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eyck</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The two sides represent the two Testaments of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The back comprises twenty-six scenes from the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Jesus</a> between the entry into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>. The steps, now taken apart, were decorated with twenty other scenes representing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> childhood, and His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the life of the Virgin. In fact, the theme was the same as that treated by <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> in 1305 in the Arena of Padua. But Duccio consulted Byzantine formularies only, and his compositions resemble the famous miniatures of the "Evangelistarium" of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, or those of the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Mont' Amiata. However, apart from his perfect taste in colour and in style, Duccio excelled in the essentially Greek elegance of his portrayal of ordinary life. He abounds in genre pictures as pure as some of the selections in the Anthology. The scene of "Peter before the High-Priest", the dialogue of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> at the Sepulchre, and the "Pilgrims of <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>" are models of poetic conception expressed in a familiar, true-to-life, lyric fashion. On the front of the great panel is the "Madonna Maest&agrave;" (Majesty), which is in reality the "Madonna de' Ruccellai" more amply, richly, and harmoniously developed. Never did Byzantine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> attain greater plasticity of expression. But here the form is animated by a new sentiment, a tenderness that manifests itself in the distich engraved on the step of the Virgin's throne: --

<blockquote><p>MATER SANCTA DEI, SIS CAUSSA SENIS REQUIEI <br>SIS DUCCIO VITA, TE QUIA PINXIT ITA. <br><br>(<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Holy Mother of God</a>, give peace unto <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>; obtain for me that, as I have <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> Thee so fair, I may live <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Duccio <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> only frame (and panel) pictures and, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, miniatures, and hence the oblivion into which he fell in a country where monumental <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> alone is glorified. Nevertheless his is the first of the great names in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. He preceded <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> by a score of years and had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of founding an original <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at a time when there were as yet no <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> in Florence: since, in 1285, it was to him that the Florentines had to have recourse. And the most magnificent work of the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> School, the "Maest..." by <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone di Martino</a>, in the Palazzo Pubblico (1315) is but an enlargement of Duccio's. His type of beauty and his poetic ideal were indelibly impressed upon this charming <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Duccio seems to have been gay and light-hearted. In 1313 he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and at another time fined for refusing to mount guard. Some of his lesser works are preserved in various collections in the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> Museum, the National Gallery, London, and at <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a>.
