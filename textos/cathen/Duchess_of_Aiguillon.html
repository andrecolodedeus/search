<h1>Duchess of Aiguillon</h1>  

<p>Marie de Vignerot de Pontcourlay, Marquise of Combalet and Duchesse d'Aiguillon; niece of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>. Born 1604; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1675.

<p>First promised to Comte de Bethune, son of Sully, she married Antoine* de Route, Marquis of Combalet, in 1620, who was killed two years later at the siege of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. A childless <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, she entered the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, fully determined to end her days there; but after <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> became premier of Louis XIII she had to follow him, and was appointed lady of the bed-chamber to Marie de M&eacute;dicis. Obliged to do the honors of the <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal's</a> palace, she took into her hands the distribution "of his liberality and of his alms", to use <a href="../cathen/06100a.htm">Fl&eacute;chier's</a> expressions. Convinced of the vanity of worldly honors, she only busied herself in distributing riches without seeking any enjoyment from wealth. She well deserved, by her virtues and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the title of "great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>" and "heroic woman", which her panegyrists give to her. Charity was her dominant <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. She had part in all the beneficence of her, times. She founded, endowed, or enriched especially the establishments of foreign missions in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the church and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint Sulpice; the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>; the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. She gave fifty thousand francs for the foundation of a general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which she first established at La Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re. Patron of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, she was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of charitable assemblies, of evangelical missions, and of the greater part of the institutions created by that saint. She gave him the funds needed to found the College des Bons-Enfants. Her charity extended to the missions of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and she defrayed the expenses of sending the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there. But it was above all the colony of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> which received a large share of her benefits. She especially recommended this work to her uncle, and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> sent some <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> there. The H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at Qu bec was erected at her expense, and she put the Religieuses Hospitali&egrave;res of Dieppe in charge of it, after providing for it an annual income of three thousand francs. Masses are still said there daily for the intention of herself and of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, and an inscription composed by her is over the principal entrance. It was under her exalted patronage that the first <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> were sent there. With <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, she conceived the plan of founding the Colony of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and got the Pope to approve of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which was formed for this purpose. Finally she had the creation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of Qu bec brought before the General Assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and obtained from <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> a pension of 1,200 crowns for its support.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of great mind was sought in marriage by princes of the royal blood, but she preferred remaining a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> the better to pursue her <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. When she was created Duchesse d'Aiguillon she gave twenty-two thousand livres to found a mission for instructing the poor of the duchy. She was equally the enlightened patroness of the writers of her time. Voiture, Scud&eacute;ry, <a href="../cathen/10434b.htm">Moli&egrave;re</a>, <a href="../cathen/13516a.htm">Scarron</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04374b.htm">Corneille</a> were recipients of her favors. The last named dedicated to her "Le Cid." After the death of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, who made her his principal heir, she retired to the Petit-Luxembourg, published her uncle's works and continued her generous benefactions to all kinds of charities. She carried out the <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal's</a> last request by having the church and the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Sorbonne completed, as well as the H&ocirc;tel Richelieu, which has since been converted into the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale. The great <a href="../cathen/06100a.htm">Fl&eacute;chier</a> was charged with pronouncing her funeral oration, which is regarded as one of the masterpieces of eloquence of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> oratory.
