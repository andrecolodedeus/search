<p>DIOCESE OF DULUTH (DULUTHENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>, established 3 Oct., 1889, suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">Archdiocese of St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> comprises the counties of Aitkin, Becker, Beltrami, Carlton, Cass, Clay, Clearwater, Cook, Crow Wing, Hubbard, Itasca, Kittson, Lake, Marshall, Norman, Pine, Polk, <a href="../cathen/13191b.htm">Roseau</a>, Red Lake, Mahnomen, Koochiching, and St. Louis, in the <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">State of Minnesota</a>, an area of 39,439 square miles.

<p>The first white men and the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to visit this region were the French fur-traders who, under Groseilliers, are recorded as having shipped furs from there in 1660. <a href="../cathen/05188a.htm">Daniel Greysolon Du Lhut</a>, the French officer, adventurer, and fur-trader after whom the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> city is named, was there in 1679. After a varying existence as trading post and frontier settlement, Duluth was incorporated as a town in May, 1857. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Minnesota was the famous <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a>, who in 1680 was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> among the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>. He explored the Mississippi and at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> named the falls in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Anthony, writing a glowing description of them in 1683. Wandering missionaries made infrequent visits to the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> and scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the region down to 1839, when the Rev. Joseph Cr&eacute;tin, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, began an active and successful missionary career.

<p>The Seventh <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (1849) recommended to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the erection of a new see at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> for the Territory of Minnesota and the appointment of Father Cr&eacute;tin as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which plan was carried out. Father Cr&eacute;tin had been in the territory for some time, trying to revive the old Indian missions and evangelize the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <em>voyageurs</em> who went there for the fur trade. The numerous Indians roaming in the wilderness had nearly forgotten the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> preached to their ancestors by the Recollects and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> more than a century before, but they were still anxious to have the "black-robes" come among them once more. In 1875 the Vicariate Apostolic of Northern Minnesota was established, and these two divisions of the whole State continued until 4 May, 1888, when <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> was raised to the rank of an archdiocese with the four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Duluth, <a href="../cathen/15658b.htm">Winona</a>, Jamestown (now Fargo), and St. Cloud, the last-named being the new title for the Vicariate of Northern Minnesota. Duluth, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> city, was within these old limits of the vicariate. In 1866 the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there were brought together by a visiting missionary. They numbered only about two dozen <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in 1870, and Father John Chebul, an Austrian by birth, attended them as a mission from <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a> and built the first frame <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for their use. Other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the formative period were Fathers G. Keller, a German, J. B. M. G&eacute;nin, a French Oblate, Joseph Buh, Charles Verwyst, Joseph Staub, Christopher Murphy, and G. J. Goebel.

<p>THE REV. JAMES McGOLRICK, a member of the council of Bishop <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the church of the Immaculate Conception, Minneapolis, was nominated as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new see and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 27 Dec., 1889. He was born 1 May, 1841, at Borrisokane, County Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the American mission at All Hallows Seminary, near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 11 June, 1867. Emigrating to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, he began his work at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> as an assistant at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He was next appointed to establish a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the then rising town of Minneapolis and remained there for twenty-two years as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of the Immaculate Conception. He found, on taking charge of his new diocese, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 19,000, of which 3000 were Indians. There were 20 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 15 secular and 5 regular; 34 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 10 stations, and 8 <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewa Indian</a> missions attended by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries.

<p>The first railroad from Duluth to <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> ran only in 1870, and in 1882 the first iron-range road, on which industry the chief reliance for material prosperity rested. The commercial panics of 1872 and 1893 were great blows to this section, but in ten years the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had increased to 38 and the missions and stations to 74 with 30 Indian missions and stations. The Sisters of St. Benedict had been introduced and were in charge of 9 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and 2 Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 1400 children. They also managed 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and a home for the aged. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population had also increased to 23,000. Since then conditions have bettered, and the statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for 1908 give these figures: <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> 65, 44 secular, 21 regular; churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> 50; missions with churches 36; stations 45; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> 15; academies for girls 3, with 395 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 10, with 1586 pupils; Indian industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 2, with 192 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> 6; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population 54,300, White 50,000, Indian 4300. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and the Oblate Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters, and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> have charge of the Indian missions, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters attend to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> established for the benefit of the Indian children, their industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> on the Red Lake and White Earth reservations being especially successful in spite of scant means and other disadvantages. The constant good done by these institutions, for the girls of the tribes especially, has been manifested by every test applied to their operation. The <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have a high school attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Duluth .
