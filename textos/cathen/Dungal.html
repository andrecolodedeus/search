<h1>Dungal</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, teacher, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and poet who flourished about 820. He is mentioned in 811 as an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and scholar at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Denis near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In that year he wrote a letter to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> explaining the eclipse of the sun which was supposed to have taken place in 810. In one of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> letters (M. G., Epp., IV, 437) he is alluded to as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 823 he is mentioned in a "capitulary" of Lothair, and in 825 in an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> by which he was appointed "master" of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Pavia. This is the last mention of Dungal in the public records of the empire. In 827 or 828 he appeared against Claudius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, in a work defending the veneration of images. From the fact that he bequeathed his books to the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of St. Columbanus at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> it is inferred that he spent his last days in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Trebbia. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is unknown. His books, many of them at least, were transferred by <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where they now are.

<p>Some historians <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the Dungal of St-Denis and the adversary of Claudius are one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The prevalent opinion, however, is that they are one and the same. In his letter to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> Dungal brings to bear on the question of eclipses a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> far beyond the current <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the time. His "Reply" to Claudius is enriched with many citations from the Greek and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The poems ascribed in most <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> to Exul Hibernicus are believed by D&uuml;mmler, editor of the "Poet&aelig; &AElig;vi Carolini", to have been written by Dungal, who like many of his fellow-exiles from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> styles himself <em>peregrinus, exul, pauper et peregrinus</em>. Only three of them bear the name Dungal. They are interesting from many points of view, especially from that of the historian who searches the records of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> reign for the all too scanty references to the personal feelings and the attitude of mind of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholars who flocked to the Continent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the ninth century. Yet they do not enable us to determine when and where Dungal was born, though from the fact that among his books which he presented to the Library of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> is the "Antiphonary of Bangor", it is inferred that he spent the ears of his student life in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at the famous Bangor <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> published a ninth-century poem from which it appears that Dungal enjoyed among his contemporaries a reputation for more than ordinary learning.
