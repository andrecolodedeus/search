<h1>Duprat</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Antoine Duprat</h2>

<p>Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at Issoire in Auvergne, 17 January, 1463; d. at the Chateau de Nantouillet near Meaux, 9 July, 1535. Educated for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> he won a high position in his profession and in 1507 became first president of the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (the highest court of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). In 1515 <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> made him chancellor and prime minister. In 1517, after his wife's death, he took Sacred orders and gradually rose in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>: first as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> held by him in plurality; then as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, 1525; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, 1527, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em>, 1530. Duprat's influence extended much beyond the departments of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and finance placed under his direct control. Hanotaux, in the introduction to his "Recueil des instructions", calls Duprat "one of the most notable men of ancient <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, second only to <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> in the decisive influence he exercised on the destinies of his country". This influence was constantly exerted to strengthen royal <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>; it was felt in the stern measures he took against the <em>grands Seigneurs</em> and in his elaborate fiscal system. Duprat's influence was also manifested together with his perfect <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, in those measures which affected the relations of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, namely, the signing of the Concordat of 1516, and the checking of nascent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The Concordat, which Duprat himself negotiated with <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> at Bologna, did away with the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> principles of the "Pragmatic Sanction"; on the other hand, by causing the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> to rest on royal <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> instead of the old canonical elections, it vested in the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> an easily abused authority over Church affairs. Duprat's uncompromising attitude towards <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was dictated both by his political sense and his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The wiles of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> did not deceive him; even so the well-known <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> sympathies of Marguerite d'Angouleme, the Duchesse d'Etampes, and the Minister du Bellay failed to move him. The Sorbonne and the Parliament were instructed to exclude the writings of the innovators; in 1534 the posting of subversive pamphlets at the door of the royal apartments cost the perpetrators their lives. Duprat left no writings, but took a leading part in the compilation of the "Coutumes d'Auvergne"; he also did much to encourage the renaissance of letters.
<h2 id="section2">Guillaume Duprat</h2>

<p>Son of the foregoing, b. at Issoire, 1507; d. at Beauregard, 1560. Appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in 1529, he led a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and saintly life and is favourably known by the leading part he took in the last sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> as well as by his patronage of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Not only did he receive them in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where they were put in charge of the colleges of Billom and Mauriac, but, in face of much opposition, he helped them financially and in other ways to found in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the College de Clermont, so called after Duprat's episcopal city.
