<h1>Durham Rite</h1>  

<p>The earliest document giving an account of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services in the <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Diocese of Durham</a> is the so-called "Rituale ecclesi&aelig; Dunelmensis", also known as the "Ritual of King &AElig;lfrith" [the King of Northumberland, who succeeded his brother Ecgfrith in 685, and who was a <em>vir in scripturis doctissimus</em> (Bede, Hist. Eccl., IV, xxvi)]. The Manuscript (in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, A, IV, 19) is of the early ninth century. It contains <em>capitula</em>, chants, and especially collects, from the Epiphany to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, then a <em>proprium sanctorum</em>, a <em>commune sanctorum</em>, and many forms for <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. The greater part has an interlinear Anglo-Saxon translation. At the end various scribes have used up the blank pages to write out a miscellaneous collection of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> and a list of contractions used in books of canon law. Its connexion with Durham and Northumberland is shown by various allusions, such as that to <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> in a collect (<em>intercedente beato Cudbertho Sacerdote;</em> p. 185 of the Surtees Soc. edition). This fragment represents the fusion of the Roman and Gallican uses that had taken place all over North-Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> since the Emperor Charles the Great (768-814) or even earlier (Duchesne, Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien, 2nd ed., 89-99). Many parts of it exactly correspond to the Gregorian Sacramentary sent by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> to the emperor (between 784 and 791; Duchesne, op. cit., 114-119).

<p>The great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> was founded by William of St. Carileph in 1083; he brought <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> and Jarrow to fill it. These <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> served the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> till the suppression in 1538. The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was laid in 1093 and <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> body was brought to its shrine in 1104. A catalogue drawn up at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> in 1395 gives a list of the books used by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> for various services. Of such books not many remain. A Gradual of about the year 1500 with four leaves of a <em>Tonarium</em> is at Jesus College, <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> (Manuscript 22; Q. B. S.), and a Durham <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> written in the fourteenth century is in the British Museum (Harl. 5289). The parts of this <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> that correspond to <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> are printed in vol. CVII of the Surtees Society's publications (pp. 172-191; see also the "Westminster Missal", III, 1424, Henry Bradshaw Soc., 1897, where the Durham variants are given). But the most important document of this kind is the volume called "The Ancient Monuments, Rites and Customs of the Monastical Church of Durham before the Suppression". This book, written in 1593, exists in several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies and has been printed and edited on various occasions, lastly by the Surtees Society (vol. CVII, 1903; see bibliography). It is a detailed description, not only of the fabric of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but also of the various rites, ceremonies, and special customs carried out by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who served it. From it we see that the Durham Rite was practically that of the North of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (corresponding in all its main points to that of York), with a few local modifications such as one would expect to find in a great and flourishing monastic church. The treatise begins with a description of the famous nine altars (ed. Surtees Soc., p. 7) and of the choir and <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was reserved in a silver pelican hung over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">High Altar</a>. It should be noted that a pelican in her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was assumed as his arms by Richard Fox (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, 1494-1502) and was constantly introduced into monuments built by him (so at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford). The great paschal candlestick was a conspicuous and splendid feature of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> ritual at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>; it and the rite of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> are described in chapter iv (ed. cit., p. 10). The Office for <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> does not differ from that of Sarum and the other English uses (ed. cit., p. 179). On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> there was a procession with <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. A special feature of the <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> service was the crucifix taken by two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from inside a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, for the Creeping to the Cross. On the same day the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was enclosed in a great <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Christ on a side altar and candles were burned before it till <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> service in the Durham <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is given on pp. 185-187 of the Surtees Society edition. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> sang the "Miserere" while they went in procession to the new fire. When the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> is lit they sing a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, "Inventor rutili", with a verse that is repeated each time. There are only five Prophecies, and then follow the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>. When "Omnes Sancti" is sung those who are to serve the Mass go out. The word <em>Accendite</em> is said and the candles are lighted. It is repeated three times; at the third repetition the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> comes out to begin the Mass. All the bells (<em>signa</em>) are rung at the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie eleison</a>, the Gloria, and the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>. Between three and four o'clock in the morning of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was brought in procession to the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, while they sang an antiphon, "Christus resurgens ex mortuis, iam non moritur", etc. Another <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Christ Risen remained on the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> during <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> week. On <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a>, Whit-Sunday, and <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a> processions went round the church, on <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> round the palace green, and on St. Mark's Day to Bow Church in the city (chs. lv, lvi). The rogation-days (three cross-daies) also had their processions. In all these the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> were carried and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> appeared in splendid copes. The prior, especially, wore a cope of cloth of gold so heavy that he could only stand in it when it was supported by "his gentlemen" (ed. cit., p. 85). The prior had the right of wearing a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> since Prior Berrington of Walworth (ch. lvi, ed. cit., p. 107).

<p>Throughout the year the chapter Mass was sung at nine o'clock, <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> at three p. m. On Thursdays, except in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, the Office of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> was sung in choir (ed. cit., p. 191). On Fridays there was a "Jesus-Mass" (a votive mass of the Holy Name), and the "Jesus-Antiphon" was sung after <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Complin</a> (ed. cit., p. 220). This was also the custom at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Lincoln, <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. On <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> Day (20 March) there was, naturally, a great feast and his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were exposed. Chapter x (ed. cit., p. 16) describes the great book containing names of benefactors (Liber Vit&aelig;) that was kept on the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, chapter xxi the forms for giving sanctuary to accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. They had to use the knocker, still shown to visitors, and, when they were received, to wear a black gown with a yellow cross "of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>" on the left shoulder (ed. cit., p. 41). No <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was allowed to approach the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> beyond a line of blue marble traced on the floor. To explain this, chapter xviii tells a legend about a king's daughter who falsely accused him and was eventually swallowed up by the earth. In the "Galilee" was a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (ch. xxii, ed. cit., p. 42). When a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> died his body was carried to St. Andrew's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> watched before it all the time; after the dirge and the requiem Mass it was buried in the sanctuary garth with a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of wax laid on the breast (ch. xxiii). Priors were buried in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church (xxv) and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the sanctuary (xxvii). (See <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">DIOCESE OF DURHAM</a>.)

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The Anglo-Saxon <em>Rituale ecclesi&aelig;, Dunelmensis</em> is published (from the Manuscript at Durham) by the SURTEES SOCIETY (vol. X, 1840), and was re-edited by SWEET in his <em>Oldest English Texts</em> (1885). The <em>Ancient Monuments, Rites and Customs of the Monastical Church of Durham before the Suppression</em> exists in a Manuscript of 1620 in the Cosin library at Durham (Manuscripts, B, II, 11) and in a Manuscript of 1656 belonging to Sir John LAWSON, Bart., of Brough Hall, Catterick (Fol., pp. 1-93). From these two texts the edition of the SURTEES SOCIETY has been printed (vol. CVII <em>Rites of Durham,</em> 1903). Other editions are: one curtailed and modernized by DAVIES (London, printed for W. Hensman in 1672); HUNTER, <em>Durham Cathedral as it was before the dissolution of the monasteries</em> (Durham, by J. ROSS for Mrs. Waghorn, 1733; reprinted, Durham, 1733); and SANDERSON, <em>The Antiquities of the Abbey or Cathedral Church of Durham</em> (Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1767). The Durham <em>Obituary Roll</em> (c. 1468) was edited by RAINE for the Surtees Society (vol. XXXI, 1856) and the <em>Liber Vit&aelig;, Ecclesi&aelig;, Dunelmensis,</em> from a ninth-century MANUSCRIPT, by STEVENSON for the same society (vol. XIII, 1841). The <em>Surtees Society Catalogue</em> (pp. 38, 115) gives a Durham <em>Canon Miss&aelig;,</em> bound up with a psalter, hymnary, and journal, of 1391 and 1416. Part of the Missal of the fourteenth century in the British Museum (Harl. 5289) is printed in vol. CVII of the Surtees Society (pp. 172-191). Occasional references to the Durham Rite will be found in ROCK, <em>Church of our Fathers,</em> ed. HART AND FRERE (4 vols., London, 1904). and in WORDSWORTH AND LITTLEDALE, <em>The Old Service-books of the English Church</em> (London, 1904).</p></div>
