<h1>Duvergier de Hauranne</h1>  

<p>(Or D<font size=-2>U</font> V<font size=-2>ERGER</font>), J<font size=-2>EAN</font>; also called S<font size=-2>AINT</font>-C<font size=-2>YRAN</font> from an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> he held <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>).

<p>One of the authors of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1581; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1643. After studying the humanities in his native place, and philosophy at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, not to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> but to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, where he graduated, 1604, with a brilliant thesis admired by Justus Lipsius. His acquaintance with the future <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Cornelius Jansen</a> (Jansenius), a young disciple of the <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baianist</a> Jacques Janson, probably began at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. In 1605 the two were in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, attending together the lessons of the Gallican, Edmond Richer, and studying <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity with a view to restoring it to its place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, usurped, as they claimed, by <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. These studies of patristic and especially Augustinian literature were pursued with incredible energy for wellnigh twelve years, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, till 1611, and then at Campiprat (Cantipr&eacute;), the home of Hauranne, under the protection of Bertrand d'Eschaux, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, who made Duvergier canon of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and Jansen principal of a newly-founded college. Owing, no doubt, to the translation of d'Eschaux from <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> to <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, the two friends left <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> in 1617, Jansen returning to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and Duvergier going to Poitiers where Bishop de la Rocheposay, a disciple of Scaliger and an enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, received him as a friend, appointed him to a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Bonneville, and later, 1620, resigned in his behalf the Abbey of Saint-Cyran-en-Brenne. The new commendatory <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> resided little in his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1622 he returned definitively to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> affording him better opportunities to further his plans. During the years 1617-1635 an assiduous correspondence was kept up between Duvergier and Jansen, of which there remain only "Lettres de Jans&eacute;nius &#224; Duvergerde Hauranne", seized at the time of Saint-Cyran's incarceration. These letters, wherein conventional ciphers are frequently used, constantly mention the <em>affaire principale, projet, cabale,</em> that is, first and foremost, the composition of the "Augustinus" by Jansen, Saint-Cyran employing himself to enlist patrons for the so-called Augustinian system (see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">J<font size=-2>ANSENISM</font> </a>).

<p>For greater security the two innovators occasionally met to discuss the progress of their joint work. One of these meetings probably gave rise to the much-debated <em>Projet de Bourg-Fontaine</em>. In his "Relation juridique de ce qui s'est pass&eacute; &#224; Poitiers touchant la nouvelle doctrine des Jans&eacute;nistes" (Poitiers, 1654), Filleau stated on the authority of one of the conspirators then repentant, that six <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had secretly met in 1621 at the <em>chartreuse</em> of Bourg-Fontaine, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for the purpose of overthrowing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and establishing deism in its stead. The names of the conspirators, only initialled by Filleau, were given in full by Bayle (Dict., s.v. "Arnauld"); that of Saint-Cyran heads the list. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> always protested against this story. Arnauld called it a "diabolical invention", and <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> ridiculed it in his "Seizi&#232;me lettre &#224; un provincial". The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Souvage's argument in his "R&eacute;alit&eacute; du projet de Bourg-Fontaine d&eacute;montr&eacute;e par l'ex&eacute;cution" (Paris, 1755) was refuted by D. Cl&eacute;mencet in "La verit&eacute; et l'innocence victorieuses de la calomnie ou huit lettres sur le projet de Bourg-Fountaine" (Paris, 1758). Although Cl&eacute;mencet's book was burned by order of the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, still it never was answered. Guizot's remark that "the adepts of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> passed insensibly from the tenets of Saint-Cyran and Montgeron to <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> and the worship of reason" (Civilisation en <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Lec. xii) may apply to some of the later <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, but the charge of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> is obviously untenable when brought against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> of the first generation. Stripped of unsupported details and deductions, Filleau's narrative and Sauvage's arguments show, what is borne out by the letters of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> and other documents of the time, a covert yet definite purpose, as early as 1621, to deeply modify the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, moral practices, and constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, St. Augustine being made responsible for such changes.

<p>As noticed above, Duvergier's share was to win high influence in favour of the religious revolution. While at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> he had met <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, de Condren, and Arnauld d'Andilly. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he sought out such men as Vincent de Paul, founder of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>; <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, founder of Saint-Sulpice; <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a>, superior of the French Oratory; Tarisse, superior of Saint-Nicholas, and many more. It cannot be denied that these men were at first attracted by Saint-Cyran's affected asceticism, but when they understood his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> aim they recoiled from him. The terse expression applied in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> to <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, <em>Sensit simul et exhorruit</em> (he shuddered on hearing), could be said of them all, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a> and Arnauld d'Andilly. <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a> never shared the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Duvergier and Jansen, but, being indebted to these two for the establishment of the French Oratory in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, he failed to detect their real purpose and gave them a hold on his order which they never released. Owing to his Gallicanism and strong prejudices against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Arnauld d'Andilly fell an easy prey to Saint-Cyran's wiles and declamations, and even brought with him the whole Arnauld <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, along with the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Port-Royal. Adroitly and persistently Saint-Cyran pushed his way into this celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, till, in 1636, he became its sole director. Not only were his innovations and rigorism eagerly accepted by the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but Port-Royal became the centre of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, drawing a host of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, lawyers, writers, etc., all vying with one another to place themselves under the "spiritual domination" of the Abb&eacute; de Saint-Cyran. His incredible success and nefarious work are well described by M. S&eacute;pet (in Rev. des quest. hist., xlv, 534): "Taking advantage of the moral enthusiasm aroused by the religious awakening, an ardent and sombre sectarian, Saint-Cyran undertook to win <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> over for the proud <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to either <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or damnation, also to an excessive rigorism to which the initiated easily accommodated themselves, while simple-hearted folk like <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> risked life and reason in its practice."

<p>Saint-Cyran was at the summit of his influence when an order of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> sent him (1638) to the donjon of Vincennes. His incarceration has been variously explained both by friends and enemies. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason when he said: "Saint-Cyran is more dangerous than six armies. &hellip; If Luther and Calvin had been arrested when they began to dogmatize, much trouble would have been spared the nations." (See Marand&eacute;, "Inconv&eacute;nients d'etat proc&eacute;dant du Jans&eacute;nisme", Paris, 1653.) <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> writers unduly insist on the rigour of Saint-Cyran's captivity. As a matter of fact, he was given liberty enough to receive his friends, to read the first printed copy of "Augustinus", to collaborate with Antoine* Arnauld on the "Fr&eacute;quente Communion", published in 1643, to write his "Th&eacute;ologie famili&#232;re" and the voluminous "Lettres chr&eacute;tiennes et spirituelles", and even to make new recruits. In 1643, after <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> death, Saint-Cyran recovered his liberty and returned in triumph to Port-Royal. The triumph, however, was clouded by the announcement that the "Augustinus" had been condemned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When the author heard of the condemnation he angrily protested that "Rome was going too far and ought to be taught a lesson"; a stroke of apoplexy, however, carried him off before he could execute his threat. Pierre de Pons, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas, in a note quoted by Rapin (Hist. du Jans., p. 305), testified that Saint-Cyran died while being anointed, but had asked for neither <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, notwithstanding a certificate to the contrary, delivered by Mulsey, when importuned and bribed by the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>.

<p>Saint-Cyran was a prolific writer. His <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, seized at the time of his arrest, formed no less than thirty-two thick folios. Amid the numerous writings ascribed to him by the "Dictionnaire des livres Jans&eacute;nistes" (Antwerp, 1755), it is difficult to distinguish his genuine works, for he generally wrote anonymously, or under a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> name, or in collaboration with others. Apart from two frivolous pamphlets written by Duvergier in his youth, "Question royale" (Paris, 1609), an apology for <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> under certain circumstances, and "Apologie pour &hellip; de la Rocheposay" (Poitiers, 1615), a thesis intended to show that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to use arms, his principal works are: (1) "Somme des fautes &hellip; du P. Garasse" (Paris, 1626), with several additional pamphlets in support of it; the book itself was a vile attack on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on occasion of a somewhat incautious book written by one of them, the heroic Father Garasse; (2) "Petrus Aurelius de hierarchi&#226; ecclesiastic&#226;" (Paris, 1631), written in collaboration with Duvergier's nephew, Barcos, and others. This book purports to be a defence of Richard Smith, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, against the alleged machinations of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; in fact it aims at winning over to the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> whose prerogatives it exaggerates to the detriment of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. The scientific portion of it is taken from the "De republic&#226; christian&#226;" (1617) of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Marc&rsquo; Antonio de Dominis; the rest consists mainly of abuse of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. By a singular inconsistency, Saint-Cyran bases the episcopal power not so much on the Sacrament of Orders as on the interior spirit. The <em>Ev&#234;que int&eacute;rieur</em>, remarks Sainte-Beuve, is simply the <em>Directeur,</em> a name and office much coveted by Saint-Cyran. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, taken by surprise, paid the expenses of the book but later ordered Sainte-Marthe's eulogy of Duvergier expunged from the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a>. (3) "Chapelet secret du tr&#232;s Saint-Sacrement" (Paris, 1632), a series of <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietist</a> remarks on the attributes of Christ. This booklet, having become a kind of storm-centre, was prudently repudiated by Saint-Cyran who nevertheless wrote several tracts in its defence. (4) "Th&eacute;ologie famili&#232;re" (Paris, 1642), a series of theologico-devotional tracts, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists'</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, teeming with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> on nearly every subject, condemned by the Holy Office, 23 April, 1654. (5) "Lettres chr&eacute;tiennes et spirituelles" (Paris, 1645); another series (Paris, 1744). <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> calls them dry and overwrought (<em>spiritualit&eacute; s&#232;che et alambiqu&eacute;e</em>). With the "Th&eacute;ologie famili&#232;re" they exhibit a fair specimen of Saint-Cyran's galimatias and obscure asceticism. Saint-Cyran's writings were collected in his "&OElig;uvres" (Lyons, 1679).
