<h1>Early Christian Representations of Angels</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> were seldom represented in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> before Constantine. The oldest fresco in which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appears is the Annunciation scene (second century) of the cemetery of St. Priscilla. A third-century <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the same subject was discovered by Wilpert in the cemetery of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus; in both representations the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Archangel Gabriel</a> is depicted in human form, robed in tunic and <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. The "Good Angel" (<em>angelus bonus</em>) of the fourth-century syncretistic fresco representing the judgment of Vibia is also depicted in human form, dressed as a sacred personage. The winged <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, for which abundant scriptural references could be adduced, does not appear in pre-Constantinian <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, for the reason, probably, that such figures might too readily recall certain favourite subjects of classic art. Another fact worthy of note in this regard is that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in this first period of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> are never represented unless historically <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as in the Annunciation scene referred to &#151; and not always even then. In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, for instance, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the <em>coemeterium majus</em>, substitutes the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the heavenly messenger.

<p>From the reign of Constantine a new type of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, with wings, appears in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. The four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with spears on the <em><a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a></em> of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> (Lib. Pont., I, 172) were probably of this order. This innovation was evidently suggested by the "Victories", and similar figures of classic art; but the danger of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> suggestion in such figures was now remote, and historic art, which gradually replaced symbolic, demanded <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with wings. Certain <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> seem to mark the transition from the classic Victory to the winged <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (Cabrol, Dict. d'Arch. Chret., col. 2116 sqq). The oldest existing examples of winged <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are seen in some <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> of Carthage and a representation on <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>, both attributed to the fourth century. The latter, part of a <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> in the British Museum, shows the <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Archangel Michael</a> standing on the upper steps of an architectonically adorned doorway, with a staff in one hand and a globe surmounted by a cross in the other. The figure is admirably executed.

<p>A second development in the artistic conception of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is marked in the Annunciation scene (fifth century) depicted on the triumphal arch of St. Mary Major's. Unlike the same subject in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Angel Gabriel</a> is soaring through the air towards Mary, who is seated in the midst of attendant winged <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. From the fifth century <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> became a favourite subject in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, no longer merely as figures demanded to complete a historical scene, but very often as attendants on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of St. Mary Major's mentioned above, as well as two <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of St. Apollinare Nuovo and St. Vitale (sixth century), <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, are examples of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in this character. The Archangels Michael and Gabriel dressed in the military chlamys and bearing military standards inscribed with the word <em>Agios</em> (holy) are represented in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> at St. Apollinare in Classe, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The <em>Hierarchia coelestis</em> of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">pseudo-Dionysius</a> exercised an important influence on the artistic conception of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from the sixth century. Prior to that time, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, a distinction was made between different categories of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> host, but now the relations of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were represented in the East after the manner of the various grades of court functionaries rendering their homage to the Emperor.
<h2>Cults of angels</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Early Christian literature</a>, like early <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, contains few references to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This fact is easily accounted for by the circumstances of the time, for with the popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a multitude of <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to lay particular emphasis on the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. An official cult in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the first centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> would have made imminent the danger of their being regarded as inferior divinities. Witness the vagaries of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. Still, there is sufficient evidence to show that the relations of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were not excluded from <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a>. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter6"><em>First Apology</em> 6</a>) states that the "host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">good angels</a>" was held in the greatest veneration, and his contemporary, <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, refers to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> "whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appointed to their several posts, to occupy themselves about the elements, and the heavens, and the world" (<a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em> 10</a>). In the fourth century we find <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> distinguishing accurately between the cult rendered to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the worship paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Demonstratio evang., III, 3), and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> recommended <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to them. From the fifth century, churches were frequently dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; Umbria was especially noted in this respect, and in the East churches erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Michael were numerous. In the most ancient <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> the Archangels Michael and <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Gabriel</a> are invoked after the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the Trinity and immediately before the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.
