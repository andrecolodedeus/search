<h1>East Syrian Rite</h1>  

<p>Also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite.
<h2>History and origin</h2>

<p>This rite is used by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and also by Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies &#151; in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Malabar &#151; who have separated from them. The Syrian and Mesopotamian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are now commonly called Chaldeans, or Syro-Chaldeans; the term <em>Chaldean</em>, which in Syriac generally meant magician or <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a>, denoted in Latin and other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages Syrian nationality and the Syriac or Aramaic language (especially that form of the latter which is found in certain chapters of Daniel), until the Latin missionaries at Mosul in the seventeenth century adopted it to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the East Syrian Rite from those of the West Syrian Rite, whom they call "Syrians", and from the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. The last call themselves "Syrians" (<em>Surayi</em>), and even "Christians" only, though they do not repudiate the name "Nestorayi", and distinguish themselves from the rest of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> as the "Church of the East" or "Easterns", as opposed to "Westerns", by which they denote Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Orthodox, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In recent times they have been called, chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, the "Assyrian Church", a name which can be defended on archaeological grounds. Brightman, in his "Liturgies Eastern and Western", includes Chaldean and Malabar <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> under "Persian Rite", and Bishop Arthur Maclean of Moray and Ross (<a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>) who is the best living authority on the existing <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, calls them "East Syrians", which is perhaps the most satisfactory term. The catalogue of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> in the British Museum has adopted the usual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nomenclature, calling the rite of the East Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> the "Chaldean Rite", that of the South Indian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and schismatics the "Malabar Rite", and that of the West Syrian <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the "Syrian Rite", a convenient arrangement in view of the fact that most printed <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of these rites are Eastern Rite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The language of all three forms of the East Syrian Rite is Syriac, a modern form of which is still spoken by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and some of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The origin of the rite is unknown. The tradition &#151; resting on the <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">legend of Abgar</a> and of his correspondence with Christ, which has been shown to be <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> &#151; is to the effect that St. Thomas the Apostle, on his way to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, established Christanity in Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and left Adaeus (or Thaddeus), "one of the Seventy", and Maris in charge. To these the normal liturgy is attributed, but it is said to have been revised by the Patriarch Yeshuyab III in about 650. Some, however, consider this liturgy to be a development of the Antiochene.

<p>After the Council of Ephesus (431), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, which had hitherto been governed by a <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a> under Antioch, refused to accept the condemnation of Nestorius, cut itself and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the East of it off from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 498 the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a> assumed the title of "Patriarch of the East", and for many centuries this most successful missionary church continued to spread throughout <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Tartary, <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, developing on lines of its own, very little influenced by the rest of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. At the end of the fourteenth century the conquests of Tamerlane all but destroyed this flourishing Church at one blow, reduced it to a few small communities in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Turkey in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and the Island of Socotra. The Cypriote <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> united themselves to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1445; in the sixteenth century there was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> between the rival lines of Mar Shimun and Mar Elia; the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of Socotra, such as it was, died out about the seventeenth century; the Malabarese Church divided into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and Schismatics in 1599, the latter deserting <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> for <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> and adopting the West Syrian Rite about fifty years later; in 1681 the Chaldean Unia, which had been struggling into existence since 1552, was finally established, and in 1778 received a great accession of strength in the adhesion of the whole Mar Elia <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, and all that was left of the original <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church consisted of the inhabitants of a district between the Lakes of Van and Urmi and Tigris, and outlying colony in Palestine. These have been further reduced by a great massacre by the Kurds in 1843, and the secession of a large number to the Russian Church within the last few years. In the late nineteenth century there was an attempt to form an "Independent Catholic Chaldean Church", on the model of the "Old Catholics". This resulted in separating a few from the Eastern Rite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.


<h2>Manuscripts and editions</h2>

<p>The authorities for this rite are chiefly in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, the printed editions being very few. Few of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, except some lectionaries in the British Museum, were written before the fifteenth century, and most, whether Chaldean or <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, are of the seventeenth and eighteenth. The books in use are: <ul><li><em>Takhsa</em>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> book, containing the Eucharistic service (<em>Qurbana</em> or <em>Qudasha</em>) in its three forms, with the administration of other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and various occasional <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. It is nearly the <em>Euchologion</em> of the Greeks (see <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>). <li><em>Kthawa dhaqdham wadhwathar</em> or <em>Qdhamuwathar</em>, "Before and After", contains the Ordinary of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> except the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, arranged for two weeks. <li><em>Dawidha</em> (David), the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, divided into <em>hulali</em>, which answer more or less to the <em>kathismata</em> of the Greeks. It includes the collects of the <em>hulali</em>. <li><em>Qiryana, Shlika w'Iwangaliyuna</em>, lections, epistles, and gospels, sometimes together, sometimes in separate books. <li><em>Turgama</em>, explanatory <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> sung before the Epistle and Gospel. <li><em>Khudra</em>, containing the variables for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and the Fast of the Ninevites, and other holy days. <li><em>Kashkul</em>, a selection from the <em>Khudra</em> for weekdays. <li><em>Geza</em>, containing variables for festivals except <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. <li><em>Abukhalima</em>, a <a href="../cathen/04104a.htm">collectary</a>, so called from its compiler, Elias III, Abu Khalim ibn al Khaditha, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, and patriarch (1175-99). <li><em>Ba'utha d'Ninwayi</em>, rhythmical <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> attributed to <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a>, used during the Fast of the Ninevites. <li><em>Takhsa d'amadha</em>, the office <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <li><em>Burakha</em>, the marriage service. <li><em>Kathnita</em>, the burial service for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. <li><em>Anidha</em>, the burial service for lay people. <li><em>Takhsa d'siamidha</em>, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> services. <li><em>Takhsa d'khusaya</em>, the "Office of Pardon", or reconciliation of penitents. </ul> These last six are excerpts from the <em>Takhsa</em>.

<p>Of the above the following have been printed in Syriac:

<p><em>For the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>:</em> The <em>Takhsa</em>, in two parts, by <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury's</a> Assyrian Mission (Urmi, 1890-92) The <a href="../cathen/03720a.htm">Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge</a> has published an English translation of the first part of the <em>Takhsa</em>, both parts "unmodified except by the omission of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> names" (Brightman); <em>Dhaqdham wadhwathar</em>, by the same (Urmi, 1894); <em>Dawidha</em>, by the same (Urmi, 1891).

<p><em>For the Chaldean Catholics:</em> 'Missale Chaldaicum", containing the Liturgy of the Apostles in Syriac and Epistles and Gospels in Syriac with an Arabic translation, in Carshuni (<a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Press fol., Rome, 1767). A new and revised edition, containing the three <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> and the lections, epistles, and gospels was published by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Mosul in 1901. The Order of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Services of Common Days, etc., from <em>Kthawa dhaqdham wadhwathar</em> (8vo, Mosul, 1866). "Breviarium Chaldaicum in usum Nationis Chaldaicae a Josepho Guriel secundo editum" (16mo, <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Press, Rome, 1865). "Breviarium Chaldaicum", etc., [8vo, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (printed at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 1886].

<p><em>For the Malabar <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>:</em> "Ordo Chaldaicus Missae Beatorum Apostolorum, juxta ritum Ecclesiae Malabaricae" (fol., <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Press, Rome, 1774). "Ordo Chaldaicus Rituum et Lectiounm", etc., (fol., Rome, 1775). "Ordo Chaldaicus ministerii Sacramentorum Sanctorum", etc., (fol., Rome, 1775). These three, which together form a <em>Takhsa</em> and Lectionary, are commonly found bound together. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> reprinted the third part in 1845. "Ordo Baptismi adultorum juxta ritum Ecclesiae Malabaricae Chaldaeorum" (8vo, <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Press, Rome, 1859), a Syriac translation of the Roman Order.

<p>The Malabar Rite was revised in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> direction by Aleixo de Menezes, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and the revision was authorized by the Synod of Diamper in 1599. So effectively was the original Malabar Rite abolished by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in favour of this revision, and by the schismatics (when in 1649, being cut off from their own patriarch by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and Portuguese, they put themselves under the Jacobite patriarch) in favour of the West Syrian Liturgy, that no copy is known to exist, but it is evident from the revised form that it could not have differed materially from the existing <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Rite.
<h2>The Eucharistic service</h2>

<p><em>Qurbana, "the Offering"; udasha, "the Hallowing"</em>

<p>There are three <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphorae</a>; that of Apostles (Sts. Adaeus and Maris), that of Nestorius, and that of Theodore (of <a href="../cathen/10555a.htm">Mopsuestia</a>) the Interpreter. The first is the normal form, and from it the Malabar revision was derived. The second is used by the Chaldeans and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> on the Epiphany and the feasts of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> and of the Greek Doctors, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Fast of the Ninevites, and on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>. The third is used by the same (except when the second is ordered) from <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Sunday to <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three. Three other <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphorae</a> are mentioned by Ebedyeshu (<a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, 1298) in his catalogue, those of Barsuma, Narses, and <a href="../cathen/05008a.htm">Diodorus of Tarsus</a>; but they are not known now, unless Dr. Wright is correct in calling the fragment in Brit. Mus. Add. 14669, "Diodore of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>".

<p>The Eucharistic Liturgy is preceded by a preparation, or "Office of the Prothesis", which includes the solemn kneading and baking of he loaves. These among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> are leavened, the flour being mixed with a little oil and the holy leaven (<em>malka</em>), which, according to the legend, "was given and handed down to us by our holy fathers Mar Addai and Mar Mari and Mar Tuma", and of which and of the holy oil a very strange story is told. The real leavening, however, is done by means of fermented dough (<em>khmira</em>) from the preparation of the last Eucharistic Liturgy. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> now use unleavened bread.

<p>The Liturgy itself is introduced by the first verse of the Gloria in Excelsis and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, with "farcings" (<em>giyura</em>), consisting of a form of the Sanctus. Then follow: <ul> <li>The <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> Psalm (variable), called <em>Marmitha</em>, with a preliminary <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, varying for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and greater feasts and for "Memorials" and <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a>. In the Malabar Rite, Pss. xiv, cl, and cxvi are said in alternate verses by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. <li>The "Antiphon of the Sanctuary" (<em>Unitha d' qanki</em>), variable, with a similarly varying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <li>The <em>Lakhumara</em>, an antiphon beginning "To Thee, Lord", which occurs in other services also preceded by a similarly varying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <li>The <em>Trisagion</em>. <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">Incense</a> is used before this. In the Eastern Rite at low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> the elements are put on the altar before the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a>. <li>The Lections. These are four or five: (a) the Law and (b) the Prophecy, from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, (c) the Lection from the Acts, (d) the Epistle, always from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, (e) the Gospel. Some days have all five lections, some four, some only three. All have an Epistle and a Gospel, but, generally, when there is a Lection from Law there is none from the Acts, and vice versa. Sometimes there is none from either Law or Acts. The first three are called <em>Qiryani</em> (Lections), the third <em>Shlikha</em> (Apostle). Before the Epistle and Gospel, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> called <em>Turgama</em> (interpretation) are, or should be, said; that before the Epistle is invariable, that of the Gospel varies with the day. They answer to the Greek <em>prokeimena</em>. The <em>Turgama</em> of the Epistle is preceded by proper psalm verses called <em>Shuraya</em> (beginning), and that of the Gospel by other proper psalm verses called <em>Zumara</em> (song). The latter includes <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> between the verses. <li>The Deacon's Litany, or <em>Eklene</em>, called <em>Karazutha</em> (proclamation). This resembles the "Great Synapte" of the Greeks. During it the proper "Antiphon [<em>Unitha</em>] of the Gospel" is sung by the people. <li>The <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> proclaim the expulsion of the unbaptized, and set the "hearers" to watch the doors. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> places the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, with words (in the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, but not in the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rite) which seem as if they were already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. He sets aside a "memorial of the Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ" (Chaldean; usual Malabar Rite, "Mother of God"; but according to Raulin's Latin of the Malabar Rite, "Mother of God Himself and of the Lord Jesus Christ"), and of the patron of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (in the Malabar Rite, "of St.Thomas"). Then follows the proper "Antiphon of the Mysteries" (<em>Unitha d' razi</em>), answering to the offertory. <li>The Creed. This is a variant of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>. It is possible that the order or words "and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost and was made man, and was conceived and born of the Virgin Mary", may enshrine a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, but the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not seem to have noticed it, their only alteration being the addition of the <em>Filioque</em>. The Malabar Book has an exact translation of Latin. In Neale's translation of the Malabar Rite the <em>Karazutha</em>, the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, and the Expulsion of the Unbaptized come before the Lections and the Creed follows immediately on the Gospel, but in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> edition of 1774 the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> follows the Creed, which follows the Gospel. <li>The first Lavabo, followed by a <em>Kushapa</em> ("beseeching", i.e., <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said in kneeling) and a form of the "Orate fratres", with its response. It is now that the variations of the three <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> begin. <li>The <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">Kiss</a> of Peace, preceded by a <em>G'hantha</em>, i.e., a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said with bowed head. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Memorial (<em>Dukhrana</em>) of the Living and the Dead, and the Diptychs; the latter is now obsolate among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>. As in all <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> this begins with a form of a Sursum corda, but the East Syrian form is more elaborate than any other, especially in the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of Theodore. Then follows the Preface of the usual type ending with the Sanctus. <li>The Post-Sanctus (to use the Hispanico-Gallican term. This is an amplification (similar in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and often in phraseology to those in all <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> except the Roman) of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Sanctus into a recital of the work of Redemption, extending to some length and ending, in the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphorae</a> of Nestorius and Theodore, with the recital of the Institution. In the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of the Apostles the recital of the Institution is wanting, though it has been supplied in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> edition of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> book. Hammond (Liturgies Eastern and Western, p. lix) and most other writers hold that the Words of Institution belong to this Liturgy and should be supplied somewhere; Hammond (loc.cit) suggests many arguments for their former presence. The reason of their absence is uncertain. While some hold that this essential passage dropped out in times of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, others say it never was there at all, being unnecessary, since the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was held to be effected by the subsequent <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> alone. Another theory, evidently of Western origin and not quite consistent with the general Eastern theory of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by an <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> following <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words, is that, being the formula of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, it was held too sacred to be written down. It does not seem to be quite certain whether <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did or did not insert the Words of Institution in old times, but it seems that many of them do not do so now. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of the Great Oblation with a second memorial of the Living and the Dead, a <em>Kushapa</em>. <li>The <em>G'hantha</em> of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, or Invocation of Holy Spirit. The <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> itself is called <em>Nithi Mar</em> (May He come, O Lord) from its opening words. The Liturgy of the Apostles is so vague as to the purpose of the Invocation that, when the words of Institution are not said, it would be difficult to imagine this formula to be sufficient on any hypothesis, Eastern or Western. The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphorae</a> of Nestorius and Theodore, besides having the Words of Institution, have definite Invocations, evidently copied from Antiochene or Byzantine forms. The older Chaldean and the Malabar <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books have inserted the Words of Institution with an <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a>, <em>after</em> the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>. But the 1901 Mosul edition puts the Words of Institution first. <li>Here follow a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> for Peace, a second Lavabo and a censing. <li>The Fraction, Consignation, Conjunction, and Commixture. The Host is broken in two, and the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a> is made in the Chalice with one half, after which the other with the half that has been dipped in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. The two halves are then reunited on the Paten. Then a cleft is made in the Host "qua parte intincta est in Sanguine" (<a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot's</a> tr.), and a particle is put in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, after some intricate arranging on the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>. <li>Communion. The veil is thrown open, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> exhorts the communicants to draw near, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> breaks up the Host for distribution. Then follows the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, with Introduction and Embolism, and the <em>Sancta Sanctis</em>, and then the 'Antiphon of the Bema" (Communion) is sung. The Communion is in both species separately, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> giving the Host and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> the Chalice. Then follows a variable antiphon of thanksgiving, a <a href="../cathen/12318b.htm">post-communion</a>, and a post-communition, and a dismissal. Afterwards the <em>Mkaprana</em>, an unconsecrated portion of the holy loaf, is distributed to the communicants, but not, as in the case of the Greek <em>antidoron</em>, and as the name of the latter implies, to non-communicants. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are communicated with the Host dipped in the Chalice. They reserve what is left of the Holy Gifts, while the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> consume all before leaving the church. </ul>

<p>Properly, and according to their own canons, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> ought to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and Friday, on every festival, and daily during the first, middle, and last week of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and the octave of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. In practice it is only said on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and greater festivals, at the best, and in many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> not so often, a sort of "dry Mass" being used instead. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> daily, and where there are many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> there will be many Masses in the same Church in one day, which is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> canons. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> editions of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> omit the names of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and call the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphorae</a> of Nestorius and Theodore the "Second Hallowing" and "Third Hallowing". Otherwise there are no alterations except the addition of Words of Institution to the first <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphorae</a>. The recent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> edition has made the same alterations and substituted "Mother of God" for "Mother of Christ". In each edition the added Words of Institution follow the form of the rite of the edition. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Mass, like those of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, are generally long and diffuse. Frequently they end with a sort of <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> called <em>Qanuna</em> which is said aloud, the rest being recited in a low tone. The <em>Qanuna</em> in form and usage resembles the Greek <em>ekphonesis</em>.

<p>The vestments used by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Mass are the <em>Sudhra</em>, a girded <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> with three crosses in red or black on the shoulder, the <em>Urara</em> (<em>orarion</em>) or stole worn crossed by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but not by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (as in the West), and the <em>Ma'apra</em>, a sort of linen cope. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> wears the <em>Sudhra</em>, with an <em>urara</em> over the left shoulder.
<h2>The divine office</h2>

<p>The nucleus of this is, as it is usual, the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and Morning) with a rarely used <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">compline</a>. In practice only Morning and Evening are commonly used, but these are extremely well attended daily by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. When <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were the custom in them, and three <em>hulali</em> of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> were recited at each. This would mean a daily recitation of the whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. The present arrangement provides for seven <em>hulali</em> at each <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> night service, ten on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, three on "Memorials", and the whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> on feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a <em>Shuraya</em>, or short psalm, with generally a portion of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are <a href="../bible/psa109.htm">109</a>, <a href="../bible/psa110.htm">110</a>, <a href="../bible/psa103.htm#vrs1">103 (1-6)</a>, <a href="../bible/psa112.htm">112</a>, <a href="../bible/psa092.htm">92</a>, <a href="../bible/psa148.htm">148</a>, <a href="../bible/psa150.htm">150</a>, <a href="../bible/psa116.htm">116</a>. On <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a> and "Memorials" <a href="../bible/psa146.htm">Psalm 146</a> is said after <a href="../bible/psa148.htm">Psalm 148</a>, and on <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a> <a href="../bible/psa001.htm#vrs1">Psalm 1:1-18</a>, comes at the end of the psalms. The rest of the services consist of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, and verses (<em>giyura</em>) inserted, like the Greek <em>stichera</em>, but more extensively, between verses of psalms. On <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> the <em>Gloria in Excelsis</em> and <em>Benedicte</em> are said instead of <a href="../bible/psa146.htm">Psalm 146</a>. Both morning and evening services end with several <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, a blessing, (<em>Khuthama</em>, "Sealing"), the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, and the Creed. The variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called "Before" (<em>Qdham</em>) and "After" (<em>Wathar</em>), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> is called <em>Qdham u wathar</em>, or at full length <em>Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar</em>, the "Book of Before and After".
<h2>The calendar</h2>

<p>The Calendar is very peculiar. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called <em>Shawu'i</em>; these are <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> (called <em>Subara,</em> "Annunciation"), Ephiphany, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, the Apostles, Summer, "Elias and the Cross", "Moses", and the "Dedication" (<em>Qudash idta</em>). "Moses" and the "Dedication" have only four weeks each. The <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> are generally named after the <em>Shawu'a</em> in which they occur, "Fourth <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of Epiphany", "Second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of the Annunciation", etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a <em>Shawu'a</em>. Most of the "Memorials" (<em>dukhrani</em>), or <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and are therefore movable feasts, but some, such as <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, Ephiphany, the Assumption, and about thirty smaller days without proper lections are on fixed days. There are four shorter <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> periods besides the Great Fast (<a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>); these are: <ul><li>the Fast of Mar Zaya, the three days after the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of the Nativity; <li>the Fast of the Virgins, after the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of the Epiphany; <li>the Rogation of the Nineties, seventy days before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; <li>the Fast of Mart Mariam (<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>), from the first to the fourteenth of August.</ul> The Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonas, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolate. As compared with the Latin and Greek Calendars, that of the Chaldeans, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, is very meagre. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a>, and several Roman days have been added to that of the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> coincides with that of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, as the Julian Calendar is used, but the years are numbered, not from the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucid</a> era, 311 B. C.
<h2>The other sacraments and occasional services</h2>

<p>The other Sacraments in use among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> are Baptism, with which is always associated an anointing, which as in other eastern rites answers to Confirmation, Holy Order and Matrimony, but not Penance or Unction of the sick. The latter appears to be unknown to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, though Assemani ("Bibliotheca Orientalis", pt. II, p. cclxxii) considers it might be shown from their books that its omission was a modern <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> now have a form not unlike the Byzantine and West Syrian. The nearest approach to Penance among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> is a form, counted as a sacrament, for the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> from which are occasionally used in cases of other penitents. Assemani's arguments (ibid., cclxxxvi-viii) for a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in Penance as a Sacrament among the ancient <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> or for the practice of auricular confession among the Malabar <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> are not conclusive. The Chaldeans have a similar form to that of he <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> omit Matrimony from the list, and according to Ebedyeshu make up the number of the mysteries to seven by including the Holy Leaven and the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">Sign of the Cross</a>, but they are now rather vague about the definition or numeration. The only other rite of any interest is the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of churches. Oil, but not <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, plays a considerable part in these rites, being used in Baptism, possibly in Confirmation, in the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, etc., in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of churches, and the making of bread for the Eucharist. It is not used in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> or for the sick. There are two sorts of oil; the one is ordinary olive oil, blessed or not blessed for the occasion, the other is the oil of he Holy Horn. The last, which, though really only plain oil, represents the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> (or <em>myron</em>) of other rites, is believed to have been handed down from the Apostles with the Holy Leaven. The legend is that the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a> caught the water which fell from the body of Christ as His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and preserved it. He gave it to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, who added to it some of the water which fell from the pierced side. At the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> gave two loaves to St. John, bidding him keep one for the Holy Leaven. With this St. John mingled some of the Blood from the side of Christ. After Pentecost the Apostles mixed oil with the sacred water, and each took a horn of it, and the loaf they ground to pieces and mixed it with flour and salt to be the Holy Leaven. The Holy Horn is constantly renewed by the addition of oil blessed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on Maunday Thurday.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> service is modelled on the Eucharistic. The Mass of the Catechumens is almost identical, with of course appropriate Collects, psalms, Litanies, and Lections. After the introductory <em>Gloria</em>, <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, <em>Marmitha</em> (in this case Psalm 88) and its Collect, follow the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the signing with oil, after which follow an Antiphon of the Sanctuary and <a href="../bible/psa044.htm">Psalm 44</a>, <a href="../bible/psa109.htm">109</a> and <a href="../bible/psa131.htm">131</a>, with <em>giyuri</em>, Litanies, and Collects, then the <em>lakhumara</em>, Trisagion, and Lections (Epistle and Gospel), and the <em>Karazutha</em>, after which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, and the unbaptized are dismissed. An antiphon answering to that "of the mysteries" follows, and then the Creed is said. The bringing forward of the Holy Horn and the blessing of the oil take the place of the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> is paralleled by Sursum corda, Preface, and Sanctus, a <em>Nithi Mar</em>, or <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, upon the oil, a commixture of the new oil with that of the Holy Horn, and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>. Then the font is blessed and signed with the holy oil, and in the place of the Communion comes the Baptism itself. The children are signed with the oil on the breast and then anointed all over, and are dipped thrice in the font. The formula is: "N., be thou <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, in the name of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." Then follows the post-baptismal thanksgiving. Confirmation follows immediately. There are two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Confirmation and a signing between the eyes with the formula: "N., is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and perfected in the name, etc." It is not quite clear whether oil should be used with this signing or not. Then any oil that remains over is poured into the Holy Horn, held over the font, and the water in the font is loosed from its former <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> with rather curious ceremonies. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have added the renunciations, profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and answers of the sponsors from the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, and anoint with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>.

<p>The marriage service (<em>Burakha</em>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">"Blessing"</a>) has nothing very distinctive about it, and resembles closely the Byzantine, and to some extent the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a>.

<p>The orders of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> are those of reader (<em>Qaruya</em>), <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> (<em>Hiupathiaqna</em>), <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> (<em>Shamasha</em>), <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<em>Qashisha</em>), <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> (<em>Arkidhyaquna</em>) and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>Apisqupa</em>). The degree of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, though has an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> service of its own, is only counted as a degree of the presbyterate, and is by some held to be the same as that of <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a></em> (<em>Kurapisqupa</em>), which never involved episcopal <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is engaged in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> functions, he is called <em>Kahna</em> (i.e., <em>lereus</em>; <em>sacerdos</em>) and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is similarly <em>Rab kahni</em> (Chief of he Priests <em>archiereus, pontifex</em>). <em>Quashisha</em> and <em>Apisqupa</em> only denote the degree. <em>Kahnutha</em>, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, is used of the three degrees of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> formula is: "N. has been set apart, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and perfected to the work of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> [or of the presbyterate] to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a> and Stephanite Office [or for the office of the Aaronic <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>], in the Name, etc., In the case of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> it is : "to the great work of the episcopate of the city of . . ." A similar formula is used for <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>.

<p>The Consecration of churches (<em>Siamidha</em> or <em>Qudash Madhbkha</em>) consists largely of unctions. The altar is anointed all over, and there are four <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> crosses on the four interior walls of the sanctuary, and these and the lintel of the door and various other places are anointed. The oil is not that of the Holy Horn, but fresh olive oil <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
