<h1>Eastern Monasticism</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Origin</h2>

<p>The first home of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">Christian monasticism</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Hither during <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> men fled the world and the danger of apostasy, to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in solitude. St. Anthony (270-356) is counted the father of all <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. His fame attracted many others, so that under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and Constantine there were large colonies of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the first <em>laurai</em>. St. Athanasius' (d. 373) friendly relations to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the refuge he found among them during his second (356-362) and third (362-363) exiles are well known incidents in his life. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> lived each in his own hut, providing for their simple needs with their own hands, united by a bond of willing submission to the direction of some older and more experienced <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, coming together on Saturday and Sunday for common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, otherwise spending their time in private contemplation and works of penance. <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">Celibacy</a> was from the beginning an essential note of monasticism. A wife and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were part of the "world" they had left.

<p>Poverty and obedience were to some extent relative, though the ideal of both was developing. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> was not necessarily a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; he formed a different class from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who stayed in the world and assisted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For a long time this difference between <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> remained; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> fled all intercourse with other people to save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> away from temptation. Later some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in order to administer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to their brethren. But even now in the East the priest-monk (<em>leromonachos</em>) is a special <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> distinct from the usual <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (<em>monachos</em>), who is a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.

<p>St. Anthony's scarcely less famous disciple Pachomius (d.345) is believed to have begun the organization of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> in groups, "folds" (<em>manorai</em>) with stricter subjection to a leader (<em>archimandrites</em>); but the organization was vague. Monasticism was still a manner of life rather than affiliation to an organized body; anyone who left wife and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the "world" to seek peace away from men was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Two codified "Rules" are attributed to Pachomius; of these the longer is translated into Latin by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, a second and shorter one is in <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, "Hist. Lausiaca" XXXVIII. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomenos</a> gives a compendium of the "Rule of Pachomius" (H.E., III, xiv). Neither of these rules is authentic, but they may well contain maxims and principles that go back to his time, mixed with later ones. They are already considerably advanced towards a regulated monastic life. They order uniformity in dress, obedience to a superior, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and meals at fixed times in common; they regulate both ascetic practices and handwork.

<p>About the same time as St. Anthony in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Hilarion flourished at <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> in Palestine (see <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, "Life of St. Hilarion" in P.L., XXXIII, 29-54). He stands at the head of West Syrian monasticism. In the middle of the fourth century, <a href="../cathen/01593c.htm">Aphraates</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in East <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. At the same time we hear of them in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Cappadocia. Epiphanius, for instance, who in 367 became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, had been for thirty years a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in Palestine. At the time of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (330-379), therefore, there were already <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> all over the East. As soon as he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (357) he determined to be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> himself; he spent two years travelling "to Alexandria, through <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Mesopotamia" (Ep.223), studying the life of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Then in 358 he formed the community at Annesos in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> that was to be in some sort a new point of departure for Eastern monasticism. He describes the life at Anesos in a letter to <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> (Ep. 2). Its principles are codified in various ascetic works by him, of which the chief are the two "Rules, the longer (<em>Horoi kata platos</em>, P.G., XXXI, 905-1052) and the shorter (<em>Horoi kat epitomen</em>, ib., 1051-1306). (See RULE OF SAINT BASIL.)
<h2 id="section2">To the Great Schism</h2>

<p>Gradually nearly all the Eastern <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> accepted the Rules of St. Basil. Their inner organization evolved a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of officials among whom the various offices were distributed; the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, meals, work, punishments were portioned out according to the ascetic works of St. Basil, and so the whole <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> arrived at a working order.

<p>That order obtains still. In its inner life Eastern monasticism has been extraordinarily stationary. There is practically no development to describe. Its history from the fourth century down to our own time is only a chronicle of the founding and endowment of new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, of the part taken by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the great religious controversies and in one or two controversies of their own, of the emperors, empresses, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and other great <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, freely or under compulsion, ended their career in the world by retiring to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> that constantly recur in Eastern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> are that the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state is that of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> and also a state of penance, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (d. c. 340) in his "Demonstratio evangelica" distinguishes the two kinds of life as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the less perfect life in the world and the perfect life of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> recurs continually. Monks lead the "angelic life", their dress is the "angelic habit"; like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> they neither marry nor give in marriage, and like them the chief object of their existence is to sing the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>). Not incompatible with this is the other <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, found in St. Basil and many others, that their state is one of penance (<em>metanoia</em>). Symeon of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> (d. 1429) counts the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> simply as "penitents" (<em>metanoountes</em>). The most perfect life on earth, namely, is that of a man who obeys the command to "do penance, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> is nigh".

<p>The organization and life of a Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> before the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is known to us by the decrees affecting it made by various councils, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in the "Corpus iuris" (in the "Codex" and the "Novellae"), the lives of eminent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, of which the "Synaxarion" has preserved not a few, and especially by the ascetic writings of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, letters, sermons, and so on, in which they give advice to their colleagues. Of such monastic writers <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (d. 754), <a href="../cathen/06455a.htm">George Hamartolos</a> (ninth century), and especially <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore of Studion</a> (d. 826) are perhaps the most valuable for this purpose. At the head of each independent <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (<em>laura</em> is the common name in Greek) was the superior. At first (e.g., by Justinian: "Nov.", V, vii; CXXIII, v and xxxiv) he is called indifferently <em>abbas, <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, hegoumenos</em>. Later the common name is <em>hegoumenos</em> only. The <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> has become a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of superior rank and takes precedence of a hegumenos. Some think that <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> meant the superior of a patriarchal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, that is, one <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the patriarch and independent of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary. The title then would correspond to that of the Western "Abbas nullius".

<p>There was an intermediate period (from about the sixth to the ninth centuries) during which the title <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> was given as a purely personal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to certain <em>hegumenoi</em> without involving any exemption from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. A further precedence belonged to a "great <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a>". The election and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the hegumenos are described by St. Basil in his two Rules, by Justinian (Novel., CXXIII, xxxiv), and <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore of Studion</a> (Testamentum, in P.G., XCIX, 1817-1818). He was elected by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by majority of votes; in cases of dispute the patriarch or ordinary decided; sometimes lots were cast. He was to be chosen for his merit, not according to the time he had already spent in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and should be sufficiently learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the canons. The patriarch or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must confirm the election and institute the hegumenos. But the emperor received him in audience and gave him a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> (the <em>hrabdos</em>). The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of induction is given in the "Euchologion". He then remained <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for life, except in the event of his being deposed, after trial, for some canonical offence. The hegumenos had absolute authority over all his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, could receive <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and inflict punishments; but he was bound always by the rule of St. Basil and the canons, and he had to consult a committee of the more experienced <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in all cases of difficulty. This committee was the <em>synaxis</em> that in many ways limited the autocracy of the superior (St. Basil's Rule, P.G., XXXI, 1037). The hegumenos in the Byzantine time, after Justinian, was generally, but not quite always, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He received the confessions of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> [there are instances of those who were not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> usurping this office (Marin, op. cit., 96)] and could ordain them to minor Orders, including the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>. Under the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of other officials, more or less numerous according to the size of the laura. The <em>deutereuon</em>took his place in case of his absence or sickness, the <em>oikonomos</em> had charge of all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the <em>kellarios</em> looked after the food, the <em>hepistemonarchos</em> saw to the regular performance of services in the church, the <em>kanonarches</em> guided the singers during the Divine office. These officials, who usually formed the synaxis, acted as a restraint on the authority of the hegumenos. Numerous lesser offices, as those of infirmarian, guest-master, porter, cook, and so on, were divided among the community. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were divided into three orders, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, those who bear the lesser habit and those who have the great habit. Children (the Council of Trullo of 692 admits profession as valid after the age of ten years), married men (if their wives are willing), even slaves who are badly treated by their masters or are in danger of losing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, could be receive as <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. Justinian ordered <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> to wear lay clothes (Novel., V, ii), but soon the custom was introduced that after a probation of about six months (while they were <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>) they should have their hair cut (<a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>) and receive a tunic (<em>chiton</em>) and the tall cap called <em>kalimauchion</em>. The service for this first clothing is in the "Euchologion".

<p>After three years' <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> received the lesser habit or <em>mandyas</em> (<em>to mikron schema, mandyas</em>). He is again <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a> in the form of a cross, receives a new tunic, belt, cap, sandals, and the monastic cloak (<em>mandyas</em>). The mandyas is the "angelic habit" that makes him a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; it is at this service that he makes his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. An older form of the "sacrament of monastic perfection" (<em>mystegion monachikes teleioseos</em>), that is, of the profession and reception of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, is given by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius Areopagita</a> (c. 500), "de Eccles. Hierarch.", VI, ii (P.G., III,533). The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is "ordained" by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<em>lereous</em>; he always calls <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em>lerarchai</em>), presumably the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Standing he recites the "monastic invocation" (<em>ten monastiken epiklesin</em>), evidently a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the grace he needs. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then asks him if he renounces everything, explains to him the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his state, signs him with the cross, <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsures</a> him and clothes him in the habit, finally celebrates the holy Liturgy, and gives him Communion. From the time of his profession the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> remains inseparately attached to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience he makes a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of perseverance in the religious exercises of the particular laura he has chosen. Normally he can no more change to another than go back to the world. He should moreover never go out at all. In theory all <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are "emclosed" (St. Basil, P.G., XXXI, 635-636); but this rule has never been taken very literally. Monks travelled about, with the consent of their superiors and with the excuse that they were engaged in business of the laura or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general.

<p>But there still remained a further step. After having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> their perseverance for some years <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were accustomed to ask, as a reward for their advancement in the ascetic life, for the "great habit" (<em>to mega kaiallelikon schema</em>). This was simply a larger and more dignified cloak, suitable for the veterans of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Gradually its reception became a regular <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> and the wearers of the great habit began to form a superior class, the aristocracy of the laura. <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore of Studion</a> objected strongly to this distinction: "As there is only one baptism", he says, "so there is only one habit" (P.G., XCIX, 1819). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there is no real place for such a higher rank in the monastic system. At the reception of the first habit the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> makes his solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> for life and becomes a full <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in every sense. However, in spite of the opposition, the custom grew. The imposition of the great habit repeats very much the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the lesser one and forms a kind of renewal of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; it is from the older <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who have gone through this rite and are honourably distinguished by their long cloaks that the dignitaries of the laura are chosen. Another gradual development was the formation of a class of priest-monks. At first no <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> received any <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>; then one or two were made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to administer <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the others, then later it became common to ordain a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But it has never become the rule that all choir-monks should be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, as it became in the West. On entering <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> people changed their name. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was to abstain from flesh-meat always; his food was fruit and vegetables and on feast-days fish, eggs, milk, and cheese. Wine was allowed. The chief meal, the only full meal in the day, was served at the sixth hour (midday); on the frequent fast-days, including every Wednesday and Friday and the four <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> times, it was put off till the ninth hour. Later in the evening, after the <em>apodeipnon</em> (compline), the remains of the meal were again spread in the refectory and any who wished, chiefly the younger members, might partake of a light supper.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> main occupation was the daily chanting of the long Byzantine office in church. This took up a great part of the day and the night. There were moreover the <em>holonyktika</em> offices, which on the eves of great feasts lasted all night. The rest of the time was spent in manual work, digging, carpentry, weaving, and so on, portioned out to each by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, of which the profit belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (St. Basil, P.G., XXXI, 1016, 1017, 1132, etc.). Men who already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> an innocent and profitable craft may continue to exercise it as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Some practised <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> for the good of the community. Nor were the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and the arts of calligraphy and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> neglected. Monasteries had <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> wrote <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore's</a> time the Studion <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was famous for its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and the beautiful handwriting of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (Theodore, "Orat.", XI,16; in P.G., XCIX). There was a scale of punishments ranging from special <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or the <em>apeulogia</em> &#151; that is, privation of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> blessing &#151; to the <em>aphoriosmos</em> or solitary confinement and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> from all common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The punishment for fornication was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for fifteen years (cf. the "Epitimia" ascribed to St. Basil in M.P., XXXI, 1305-1314). A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his constancy for many years in the community could receive permission from the hegumenos to practise the severer life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. He then went to occupy a solitary cell near the laura (St. Basil's Rule, P.G., XXXI, 1133). But he was still counted a member of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and could return to it if he found solitude too hard. At the court of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople was an official, the Exarch of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to supervise the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Most other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had a similar assistant among their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">Celibacy</a> became an ideal for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the East gradually, as it did in the West. In the fourth century we still find <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen's</a> father, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nanzianzos, living with his wife, without <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. But very soon after that the present Eastern rule obtained. It is less strict than in the West. No one can marry after he has been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (Paphnutius at the first Council of Nicaea maintains this; the first Canon of the Synod of Neoc&aelig;sarea in 314 or 325, and Can. Apost., xxvi. The Synod of Elvira about 300 had decreed absolute <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> for all clerks in the West, Can. xxxiii, ib., pp. 238-239); <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> already married may keep their wives (the same law applied to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>: Can. vi of the Synod in Trullo, 692), but <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must be <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a>. As nearly all <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> were married this meant that, as a general rule, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were chosen from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and so these became, as they still are, the road through advancement may be attained. Besides the communities in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> there were many extraordinary developments of monasticism. There were always <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> who practised various extreme forms of asceticism, such as binding tight ropes round their bodies, very severe <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and so on. A singular form of asceticism was that of the Stylites (<em>stylitai</em>), who lived on columns. St. Symeon Stylites began this practice in 420.

<p>From the time of Constantine the building and endowment of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> became a form of good work adopted by very many rich people. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a> and Helen set the example and almost every emperor afterwards (except <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>) followed it. So <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> grew up all over the empire. Constantinople especially was covered with them. One of the chief of these was Studion (<em>Stoudion</em>) in the south-western angle of the city, founded by a Roman, Studius, in 462 or 463. It was occupied by so-called "sleepless" (<em>akoimetoi</em>) <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who, divided into companies, kept an unceasing round of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and psalm-singing day and night in their church. But they were not a separate order; there was no distinction between various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a>, the great defender of images in the second <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, became Hergumenos of Studion in 799 (till his death in 826). His letters, sermons and constitutions for the Studite <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> gave renewed ideals and influenced all Byzantine monasticism. During this period a great number of decrees of Synods, ordinances of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, emperors and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, further defined and expanded the rule of St. Basil. Many Eastern <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> draw up among their canons <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, often merely enforcing the old rule (e.g. the Synod of <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangres</a> in the middle of the fourth century, Can., xix, etc.). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/08493a.htm">John the Faster</a> (d. 595), the Patriarch Nicephoros (d. 829), and so on, down to Photius, added to these rules, which, collected and commented in the various constitutions and <em>typika</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, remain the guide of a Byzantine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Most of all, <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore's</a> "Constitutions of Studion" (P.G., XCIX, 1703-1720) and his list of punishment for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (ib., 1734-1758) represent a classical and much copied example of such a collection of rules and principles from approved sources. St. Basil's mother and sister had formed a community of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at Annesos near the settlement of the men. From that time <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> spread throughout the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, organized according to the same rule and following the same life as that of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with whatever modifications were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their sex. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or patriarch. Their spiritual needs were provided for by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, generally a priest-monk, who was their "ghostly father" (<em>pheumatikos pater</em>). The <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> was called <em>hegoumenissa</em>.

<p>Lastly, during this period the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> play a very important part in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, for instance, in his disputes with Constantinople and Antioch could always count on the fanatical loyalty of the great crowd of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who swarmed up from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> in his defence. Often we hear of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> fighting, leading tumults, boldly attacking the soldiers. In all the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> troubles the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and the capital were able to throw the great weight of their united influence on the one side or the other. During the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (482-519), while the whole <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> broke communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, only the "sleepless" <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Studion remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. On the whole, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side. During the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they were so determined against the overthrow of the holy pictures that the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperors made the abolition of monasticism part of their programme and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> people for being <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> just as much as for worshipping images (see <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">ICONOCLASM</a>). Especially the great Studion <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Constantinople had a tradition of unswerving <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and loyalty to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They alone kept communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, they were the leaders of the Image-worshippers in <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> times, and their great <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a> (d. 826) was one of the last defenders of union and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> before the great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.
<h2 id="section3">From the Schism to modern times</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> made little difference to the inner life of the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Like the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people they quietly followed their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who followed the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, who followed the Oecumenical patriarch into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. After that their life went on as before, except that, having lost the advantage of intercourse with the West, they gradually drifted into the same stagnation as the rest of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. They lost their tradition of scholarship, they had never done any work in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and so they gradually arrived at the ideal that the "angelic life" meant besides their immensely long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, contemplation and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, doing nothing at all. In the eighteenth century, when an attempt was made to found <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, they fiercely resented such a <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> of their ideal. During the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Orthodox remained immeasurably behind the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who were converting western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and making their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the homes of scholarship. The chief event of this period is the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, destined to become the centre of Orthodox monasticism. When St. Athanasius of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> founded the great Laura there, there were already cells of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> on the holy mountain. Nevertheless he is rightly looked upon as the founder of the communities that made <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> so great a centre of Orthodoxy.

<p>In the tenth and eleventh centuries the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> called the Meteora in Thessaly were built on their inaccessible peaks to escape the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquests made little difference to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> respect religious. Their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had spoken well of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (Koran, Sura V, 85) and had given a charter of protection to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Sinai; but they shared fully the degradation of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> rule. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest sealed their isolation from the rest of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> became the refuge of peasants too lazy to work, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> earned the scorn with which he is regarded by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> people in the East. Eugenios Bulgaris (d.1800), one of the chief restorers of classical scholarship among the Greeks, made a futile attempt to found a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> drove him out with contumely as an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist</a> and a blasphemer, and pulled his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> down. Its ruins still stand as a warning that study forms no part of the "angelic life".
<h2 id="section4">Monasticism in the present Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>The sixteen independent Churches that make up the Orthodox communion are full of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. There are fewer <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. One great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, follows what professes to be the old rule of St. Anthony. All the others have St. Basil's rule with the additions, expansions, and modifications made by later emperors, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. There is no distinction of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders as in the West, though many lauras have customs of their own. All <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are "Basilians" if one must give them a special name. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is <em>monachos</em>, a priest-monk <em>leromonachos</em>. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is or <em>mone</em> or <em>laura</em>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> (<em>archarios</em>) wears a tunic called<em>hrasos</em> with a belt and the <em>kalimauchion</em> of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, he is often called <em>hrasophoros</em>. After two years (the period is sometimes shortened) he makes his (solemn) <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and receives the small habit (<em>mandyas</em>). Technically he is now a <em>mikroschemos</em>, though the word is not often used. After an undefined time of perseverance he receives the great habit (<em>koukoulion</em>) and becomes <em>megaloschemos</em>. The popular Greek name for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is "good old man" (<em>kalogeros</em>). The election, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the hegumenos and other dignitaries remain as they were before the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The title "archimandrite" appears to be given now to <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the more important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and also sometimes as a personal title of distinction to others. It involves only precedence of rank.

<p>Most <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> depend on the local <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. In the Orthodox states (Russia, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, etc.) the Holy Synod has a good deal to say in their management, confirms the election of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, controls, and not unfrequently confiscates their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. But certain great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are exempt from local <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the patriarch or Holy Synod. These are called <em>stauropegia</em>. One Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Mount Sinai) of which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> is also "Archbishop of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Sinai</a>", is an autocephalous Church, obeying only Christ and the Seven Councils. The <em>Genikoi kanonismoi</em> of the Ecumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> contain a chapter about <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (pp. 67 sq.). They are divided into three classes, those with more than twenty, more than ten or more than five <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Only those of the first class (more than twenty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>) are bound to sing all the Divine office and celebrate the holy Liturgy every day. Monasteries with less than five <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are to be suppressed or incorporated in larger ones. Monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> accumulated in the East as in the West. Many quarrels between the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> have arisen from usurped control or even wholesale confiscation of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by the various Orthodox governments. The first Greek Parliament in 1833 (at Nauplion) suppressed all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the new kingdom that had less than six <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In 1864 Cusa confiscated all monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, of which much belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>. In 1875 <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> confiscated three-fifths of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in Bessarabia belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Holy Sepulchre. Of the rest it paid itself one-fifth for its trouble and applied two-fifths to what is described euphemistically as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have farms called <em>meochia</em> in distant lands. Generally a few <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are sent to administer the <em>metochion</em> of which all the revenue belongs to the mother-house. The most famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the southern part of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> are <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, the Holy Sepulchre at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the Meteora in Thessaly, Sveti Naum on the Lake of Ochrida and most of all, <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>. The national quarrels in the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> have full development at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>. Till lately the Greeks succeeded in crushing all foreign elements. They drove the Georgians from Iviron, the Bulgars from Philotheos, Xenophon, and St. Paul's. Now they are rapidly losing ground and influence; the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> are building large <em>Sketai</em>, and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> here as everywhere is the great danger to the Greek element. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> have only one Laura (Panteleimon or Russiko) but with its huge Sketai it contains more <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> than all the Greek lauras together. All the <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are <em>stauropegia</em>; only the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople has any <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. For ordinations the Hegumenoi invite the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have also the dignity of "Imperial" lauras, as having been under the protection of former emperors.
<h2 id="section5">Monasticism in Russia</h2>

<p>There have been <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> since <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first preached there in the tenth century. Their great period was the fourteenth century; their decline began in the sixteenth. Peter the Great (1661-1725) at one time meant to suppress the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> altogether. In 1723 he forbade new <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> to be received. Under Catherine II (1761-1796) a more prosperous era began; since Alexander (1801-1825) <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> flourish again all over the empire. The latest census (1896) counts 495 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 249 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. These are divided into 4 lauras (in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the name means a certain precedence and special privileges); 7 stauropegia (subject directly to the Holy Synod and exempt from the ordinary's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>), 64 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> attached to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> palaces. The rest are divided into three classes. There are 73 of the first class (which have at least 33 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or, if <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 52 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>), 100 of the second (17 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>) and 191 of the third (12 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or 17 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>). There are further 350 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> not classified. Catherine II introduced the practice of drawing up official lists of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. She found 1072 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in her empire of which she abolished 496 and classified the rest. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, as at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are either coenobic (<em>obshejitel'nyie</em>) or idiorhythmic (<em>neobshejitel'nyie</em>); but these latter are not n favour with the Holy Synod which restores the coenobic rule wherever possible. Some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are supported by government (<em>shtatnyie</em>), others have to support themselves. The three classes mentioned above concern the amounts received by the supported <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The stauropegia are: Solovetsky, at Archangel, Simonoff, Donskoyi, Novospassky at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Voskresensky or New Jerusalem, Spaso-Yakovlesky. The census of 1896 counts 40,940 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and 7464 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the empire. The most famous Russian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are Kieff (Kievsky Laura) founded in 1062 by a St. Anthony, the largest of all; the Troitzsky Laura near <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, founded by St. Sergius in 1335 and now the home of the first "Ecclesiastical Academy" (Seminary) in the empire; the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> is its hegumenos. The Pochaievsky Laura, founded in the thirteenth century and famous for its <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <em>eikon</em> of the Blessed Virgin; Solovetsky, founded in 1429; Surieff (in the government of Novgorod) founded in 1030; Tikhvinsy (in Novgorod); Volokolamsky (in the <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> government) founded by St. Joseph of Volokolamsk in 1479, which has an important <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and has often been used as a state <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and Kyrilla-Bilesersky (in Novgorod) founded by St. Cyril in 1397.
<h2 id="section6">Monasticism in the lesser Eastern Churches</h2>

<p>Little may be said of these Churches. All had fully developed monasticism according to St. Basil's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> before they went into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and all have <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> under much the same conditions as the Orthodox, though, naturally, in each case there has been some special development of their own. The <em><a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a></em> once had many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. One eighteenth-century scholar counted 31. Since the fourteenth century the discipline has become so relaxed that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> can easily get dispensed from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and marry. They now have neither <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> nor <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; but there are <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who live in their own houses or wander about. The <em>Copts</em> have many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> arranged almost exactly like those of the Orthodox. The <em>Abyssinian</em> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are very flourishing (ib. 299-302). There are in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> also people called <em>debterats</em>, regular canons who say the office in common and obey a superior called <em>nebrait</em>, but may marry. The Nebrait of Aksum is one of the most powerful members of the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church and the leader of the national party against the foreign (Coptic) <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The <em>Syrian <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a></em> once had a great number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Down to the sixth century there were still Stylites among them. They now have only nine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the present reduced state of their Church, most of them also residences of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The Jacobite <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> very strictly. To eat meat is a crime punished as equal to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church, as being considerably the largest and most flourishing of there lesser <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, has the largest number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the most flourishing state. <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> follow St. Basil's rule, but are much stricter in the matter of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts eight years. It is a curious contrast to this strictness that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> is often not a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at all, but a married <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> who hands on his office to his son by hereditary right. Most <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> live in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Etchmiadzin, the residence of the Katholikos, is theoretically the centre of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Churh. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have the huge <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. James, the centre of their quarter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> lives, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Deir asseituni on Mount Sion with a hundred <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> do not as a rule become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are taken from the unmarried Vartabeds, that is, the higher class of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> (doctors). In all the other <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. All use their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as places of punishment for refractory <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.
<h2 id="section7">Eastern Catholic monks</h2>

<p>The only difference union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> makes to Eastern <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is that there is in the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches a certain tendency to emulate the Latin <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. As this generally means a disposition to do something more than recite the Divine office, it may be counted an unmixed advantage. Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> &#151; like all the Eastern <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> &#151; are admittedly better <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> than the Orthodox; some of them at least attend Western <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of Latin religious in the East. It is a Latinizing tendency that makes them often use special names for their order and even evolve into something like separate <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Thus most Byzantine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> call themselves "Basilians", as the Latins use "Benedictine" or "Franciscan". Among the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> the two great congregations of Salvatorians and Shuwerites (see <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">MELCHITES</a>) are practically different orders. The <em>Armenian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a></em> have the famous <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarist</a> Congregation, really a special <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order founded by Mechitar (1676-1749). The <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> have the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Lazaro at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and a branch separated from the others in 1774 have a house at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. By their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, missions, and literary activity they have always done great things in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> and converting their countrymen. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>Chaldees</em> have three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, Rabban Hormuzd, Alkosh, and Mar Yurgis in Mesopotamia. The <em><a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a></em> Church from the beginning has been specially a monastic Church. It was first formed by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. John Maro, in the Lebanon, from the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Since their union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they have formed separate orders. Till 1757 there were two such orders, those of St. Isaias and of St. Antony. The St. Antony <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> then split again into two congregations, the Aleppians (<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>) and Baladites (<em>baladiye</em>, country <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>). <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> sanctioned this separation in 1770. All follow the rule of St. Antony. For the rest the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of each Church have the same rule and customs as the corresponding schismatics. Certain details have been revised and abuses eliminated by the Roman authorities. There are Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> wherever there are Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are by no means always <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as there are many of unmarried <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. One may note especially the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07040b.htm">Grottaferrata</a> outside <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
