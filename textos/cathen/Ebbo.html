<h1>Ebbo</h1>  

<p>(EBO)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, b. towards the end of the eighth century; d. 20 March, 851. Though born of German serfs, he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the court of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> who gave him his liberty. After his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he became librarian of Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire and was his councillor in the government of Aquitaine. When Louis became emperor he appointed Ebbo <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the vacant See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 816. Acting on the suggestion of the emperor, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 822, in order to obtain permission from Pope Paschal I to preach the Gospel to the Danes. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> not only gave his sanction but also appointed Ebbo <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for the North. In company with a certain Halitgar, probably the one who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (817-831), and Willerich, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, he set out for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in the spring of 823, and after preaching with some success during the following summer he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the autumn of the same year. Twice again he returned to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, but each time his stay was of short duration and without any lasting effect on the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Danes whose Christianization was brought about a few years later by St. Ansgar. When, in 830, the sons of the emperor rose in rebellion against their father, Ebbo supported the emperor; but three years later he turned against him and on 13 November, 833, presided at the shameful scene enacted in the Church of St. Mary at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, where the aged emperor was deposed and compelled to perform public penance for crimes which he had not committed. As a reward for this disgraceful act Ebbo received the rich Abbey of St. Vaast from Lothaire. He continued to support the rebellious Lothaire even after Louis had been solemnly reinstated in March, 834. Being prevented by a severe attack of the gout from following Lothaire to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he took refuge in the cell of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but was found out and sent as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. On 2 February, 835, he appeared at the Synod of Thionville, where in the presence of the emperor and forty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> he solemnly declared the monarch innocent of the crimes of which he had accused him at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, and on 28 February, 835, made a public recantation from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>.

<p>Returning to the synod at Thionville, Ebbo was deposed by the emperor and the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and brought back as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. Somewhat later he was given in custody to Bishop Fr&eacute;culf of Lisieux and afterwards to Abbot Boso of Fleury. When Lothair became emperor, Ebbo was restored to the See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, in December, 840, but a year later, when Charles the Bald invaded the north-eastern part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he was again driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Many had considered Ebbo's reinstatement by Lothair unlawful, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>, who became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a> in 845, refused to recognize the ordinations administered by him after his reinstatement. The Council of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> (853) declared the ordinations invalid. There seems to be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the pseudo-Isidorian <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> have as their author one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Ebbo after his reinstatement. Ebbo found shelter at the court of Lothair, who gave him the incomes of several <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and used him for various legations. In 844 Ebbo requested <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a> to restore him to the See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> but was admitted only to lay communion. A few other attempts to regain his former see were likewise unsuccessful. When Lothair could make no further use of Ebbo he discarded him, but Ebbo found a supporter in Louis the German, who appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> some time between April, 845, and October, 847. Ebbo is the author of the "Apologeticul Ebbonis", a short apologetic narrative of his deposition and reinstatement. It is published in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Amplissima Collectio Conciliorum", XIV, 775-9, and in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXVI, 11-16.
