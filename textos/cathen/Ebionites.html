<h1>Ebionites</h1>  

<p>By this name were designated one or more early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> infected with Judaistic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>.

<p>The word <em>Ebionites</em>, or rather, more correctly, <em>Ebion&aelig;ans</em> (<em>Ebionaioi</em>), is a transliteration of an Aramean word meaning "poor men". It first occurs in <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Adv. Haer., I, xxvi, 2, but without designation of meaning. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/04162.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> II.1</a>; De Princ., IV, i, 22) and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.27</a>) refer the name of these sectaries either to the poverty of their understanding, or to the poverty of the Law to which they clung, or to the poor opinions they held concerning Christ. This, however, is obviously not the historic origin of the name. Other writers, such as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Praescr., xxxiii; De Carne Chr., xiv, 18), <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (cfr. Pseudo-Tert., Adv. Haer., III, as reflecting <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus's</a> lost "Syntagma"), and Epiphanius (Haeres., xxx) derive the name of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> from a certain Ebion, its supposed founder. Epiphanius even mentions the place of his birth, a hamlet called Cochabe in the district of Bashan, and relates that he travelled through <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and even came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Of modern scholars Hilgenfeld has maintained the historical existence of this Ebion, mainly on the ground of some passages ascribed to Ebion by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Comm. in Gal., iii, 14) and by the author of a compilation of patristic texts against the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>. But these passages are not likely to be genuine, and Ebion, otherwise unknown to history, is probably only an invention to account for the name Ebionites. The name may have been self-imposed by those who gladly claimed the beatitude of being poor in spirit, or who claimed to live after the pattern of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who laid their goods at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Perhaps, however, it was first imposed by others and is to be connected with the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> poverty of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Palestine (cf. <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs10">Galatians 2:10</a>). Recent scholars have plausibly maintained that the term did not originally designate any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, but merely the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Palestine who continued to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>. These, ceasing to be in touch with the bulk of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world, would gradually have drifted away from the standard of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and become formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. A stage in this development is seen in <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin's</a> "Dialogue with Trypho the Jew", chapter xlvii (about A.D. 140), where he speaks of two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> estranged from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: those who observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> for themselves, but do not require observance thereof from others; and those who hold it of universal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. The latter are considered <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> by all; but with the former <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> would hold communion, though not all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> would show them the same indulgence. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, however, does not use the term <em>Ebionites</em>, and when this term first occurs (about A.D. 175) it designates a distinctly <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>.

<p>The doctrines of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> are said by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> to be like those of <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> and Carpocrates. They denied the Divinity and the virginal birth of Christ; they clung to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>; they regarded <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, and used only a Gospel according to St. Matthew (Adv. Haer., I, xxvi, 2; III, xxi, 2; IV, xxxiii, 4; V, i, 3). Their doctrines are similarly described by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (Philos., VIII, xxii, X, xviii) and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De carne Chr., xiv, 18), but their observance of the Law seems no longer so prominent a feature of their system as in the account given by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is the first (<a href="../fathers/04165.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> V.61</a>) to mark a distinction between two classes of Ebionites, a distinction which <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> also gives (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.27</a>). Some Ebionites accept, but others reject, the virginal birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though all reject His pre-existence and His Divinity. Those who accepted the virginal birth seem to have had more exalted views concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and, besides observing the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, to have kept the Sunday as a memorial of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. The milder sort of Ebionites were probably fewer and less important than their stricter brethren, because the denial of the virgin birth was commonly attributed to all. (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Hom. in Luc., xvii) <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> calls the more <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> section Ebionites, and the more Catholic-minded, Nazarenes. But we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> obtained his information or or how far it is reliable. It is very hazardous, therefore, to maintain, as is sometimes done, that the distinction between Nazarenes and Ebionites goes back to the earliest days of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>Besides these merely Judaistic Ebionites, there existed a later <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> development of the same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. These Ebionite <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> differed widely from the main <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, in that they absolutely rejected any distinction between <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and the Supreme Good God. Those who regard this distinction as essential to <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> would even object to classing Ebionites as <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. But on the other hand the general character of their teaching is unmistakably <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>. This can be gathered from the Pseudo-Clementines and may be summed up as follows: Matter is eternal, and an emanation of the Deity; nay it constitutes, as it were, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> body. Creation, therefore, is but the transformation of pre-existing material. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thus "creates" the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> by the instrumentality of His wisdom which is described as a "demiurgic hand" (<em>cheir demiourgousa</em>) producing the world. But this Logos, or Sophia, does not constitute a different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Sophia produces the world by a successive evolution of syzygies, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> in each case preceding the male but being finally overcome by him. This <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is, moreover, divided into two realms, that of good and that of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> rules over the realm of the good, and to him is given the world to come, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Prince of Evil</a> is the prince of this world (cf. <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs30">John 14:30</a>; <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs21">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../bible/eph006.htm#vrs12">6:12</a>). This <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the Christ, a middle-being between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creation, not a creature, yet not equal to, nor even to be compared with, the Father (<em>autogenneto ou sygkrinetai</em> &#151; "Hom.", xvi, 16). Adam was the bearer of the first revelation, Moses of the second, Christ of the third and perfect one. The union of Christ with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is involved in obscurity. Man is saved by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>gnosis</em>), by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Teacher, and by being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thus he receives <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and strength to observe all the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Christ shall come again to triumph over <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> as light dispels darkness. The system is <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, Persian <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> fused together, and here and there reminds one of Mandaistic literature. The "Recognitions", as given us in Rufinus's translation (revision?), come nearer to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> than do the "Homilies".

<p>Amongst the writings of the Ebionites must be mentioned: <ul><li>Their Gospel. St. Iren&aelig;us only states that they used the Gospel of St. Matthew. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> modifies this statement by speaking of the so-called Gospel according to the Hebrews, which was known to Hegesippus (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.22.8</a>), <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Jerome, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 2</a>), and Clem. Alex. (<a href="../fathers/02102.htm"><em>Stromata</em> II.9.45</a>). This, probably, was the slightly modified Aramaic original of St. Matthew, written in Hebrew characters. But <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> attributes this to the Nazarenes, while the Ebionites proper only possessed an incomplete, falsified, and truncated copy thereof (Adv. Haer., xxix, 9). It is possibly identical with the Gospel of the Twelve. <li>Their Apocrypha: "The Circuits of Peter" (<em>periodoi Petrou</em>) and <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, amongst which the "Ascents of James" (<em>anabathmoi Iakobou</em>). The first-named books are substantially contained in the Clementine Homilies under the title of Clement's "Compendium of Peter's itinerary sermons", and also in the "Recognitions" ascribed to the same. They form an early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> didactic novel to propagate Ebionite views, i.e. their <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> doctrines, the supremacy of James, their connection with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and their antagonism to <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/04039b.htm">CLEMENTINES</a>.) <li>The Works of Symmachus, i.e. his translation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15367a.htm">VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE</a>; <a href="../cathen/14378a.htm">SYMMACHUS THE EBIONITE</a>), and his "Hypomnemata" against the canonical Gospel of St. Matthew. The latter work, which is totally lost (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.17</a>; Jerome, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 44</a>), is probably identical with "De distinctione pr&aelig;ceptorum", mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, Bibl. Or., III, 1). <li>The book of Elchesai, or of "The Hidden power", purporting to have been written about A.D. 100 and brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about A.D. 217 by Alcibiades of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a>. Those who accepted its doctrines and its new <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> were called Elchesaites. (Hipp., "Philos.", IX, xiv-xvii; Epiph., "Haer.", xix, 1; liii, 1.) </ul> Of the history of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> hardly anything is known. They exerted only the slightest influence in the East and none at all in the West, where they were known as Symmachiani. In St. Epiphanius's time small communities seem still to have existed in some hamlets of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine, but they were lost in obscurity. Further east, in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, their influence is perhaps traceable amongst the <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandeans</a>, and it is suggested by Uhlhorn and others that they may be brought into connection with the origin of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>.
