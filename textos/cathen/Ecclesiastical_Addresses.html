<h1>Ecclesiastical Addresses</h1>  

<p>It is from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> that we derive rules as to what is fitting and customary in the matter of ecclesiastical correspondence. These rules the different <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nations have adopted with greater or lesser modifications, according to local conditions, resulting in differences which will be here dealt with.
<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>Before describing how an address should be written, or how a letter to an <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical personage</a> should be begun and ended, it may be well to say that the paper must always be white, no other colour being allowed. The size and form of stationery considered appropriate is that known in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as <em>palomba</em>; it is used by the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, and is so called because it has the watermark of a dove (It., <em>palomba</em>). In other countries the paper used for protocols or ministerial correspondence may be employed, but it should be handmade, as both stronger and more suitable.

<p>The ink must always be black; coloured inks are forbidden; first, because they are contrary to traditional usage, and next because they are liable to changes, having, for the most part, a basis of aniline or of animal oil; moreover, these inks on being exposed to the light lose colour rapidly and soon make the letter impossible to read.

<p>The letter must be written as our fathers wrote, and not, as business letters are now sometimes written, first on the right hand sheet and then on the left, in inverse order to that of the leaves of a book. This is expressly laid down in an instruction issued by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> when Monsignor Ciasca was secretary, and rests on the necessity of providing for the due order of the archives and for facility of classification.

<p>Lastly, it is better not to write on the back of the sheet, as the ink may soak through the paper and make the document less easy to read; in any case, it is a rule of politeness to facilitate the reading of a letter in every possible way.

<p>Ten years ago the use of a typewriter was not permissible; at the present day it is. Many decrees of the Congregation of Rites are written in this way; the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars allow it in the case of documents addressed to them, and other <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a> have followed their example, but letters addressed to the Sovereign Pontiff personally must still be written by hand. If the letter be sealed, red wax must be used, any other colour, or even black, being forbidden; but the use of wafers, made to look like seals of red wax, which are gummed on to the envelope, is now tolerated. Moreover, according to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a>, the seal used should be smaller in proportion to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> addressed. In practice, however, it is not easy to follow this rule, since it is not everyone who possesses seals of different sizes.
<h2>Forms of address in various countries</h2>
<h3>Italy</h3>

<p><em>The Pope</em>

<p>The Sovereign Pontiff is addressed at the commencement of a letter as "Most Holy Father" <em>(Beatissimo Padre)</em>; in the body of the letter as "His Holiness" <em>(Sua or Vostra Santit&agrave;).</em> It is customary to speak to him always in the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and the letter ends with: "Prostrate at the feet of Your Holiness, I have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to profess myself, with the most profound respect, Your Holiness's most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant."

<p>If, instead of a letter, a petition is sent to the Sovereign Pontiff, to be examined by him or by one of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, it should begin: "Most Holy Father, Prostrate at the feet of Your Holiness, the undersigned N., of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of N., has the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to set forth as follows:" &#151; and the statement of the request ends with the words: "And may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . ." (meaning, "May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> enrich Your Holiness with His <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>"). If written in Italian the petition ends with the formula, <em>Che della grazia . . .,</em> the beginning of a phrase implying that the favour asked is looked for from the great kindness of the Sovereign Pontiff. After folding the petition lengthways to the paper, the petitioner should write at the top, "To His Holiness, Pope N. . . . ."; in the middle, "for the petitioner" <em>(per l'infrascritto oratore)</em>, and at the bottom, to the right, the name of the agent, or the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> charged with the transaction of that particular business at the Roman court.

<p><em>Cardinals</em>

<p>In writing to an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the letter should begin with the words, "Most Reverend Eminence" <em>(Eminenza Revma.)</em>; if he should be of a princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, "Most Illustrious and Reverend Eminence". In the body of the letter itself he should always be addressed in the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and as "Your Eminence", or "His Eminence", and the letter should end: "Embracing the purple of His Most Reverend Eminence, I am His Eminence's very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and obedient servant". This is an adaptation of the more complicated Italian formula, "Prostrato al bacio della sacra porpora, ho l'onore di confermarmi dell' Eminenza Vostra Rev'ma dev'mo ed oss'mo servo". The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal's</a> address, as written on the envelope, must be repeated at the left-hand lower corner of the first page of the letter, and this must be done in all letters of this kind, being intended to show that there has been no mistake made in the address.

<p><em>Bishops</em>

<p>A Bishop's title is "Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lord". The words, "Your Greatness", a translation of the Latin, <em>Amplitudo Vestra,</em> used in chancery letters, are not customary in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, except when writing in Latin. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there generally receive the title of "Excellency" <em>(Eccellenza).</em> A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <em>Congregatio Ceremonialis,</em> 3 June, 1893, assigns this title to <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, instead of "His Beatitude", wrongly assumed by them. Traditional usage, indeed, reserves this title to the Sovereign Pontiff, one of the most ancient instances being met with in a letter from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> to Pope St. Damasus (d. 384), but in practice <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> still use it, and it is still given to them. Nuncios take the title of "Excellency" in accordance to the usage of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> courts, and custom accords it to <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in virtue of their office (see <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">LEGATE</a>), of whom the best known is the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As all Bishops in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> take, or accept, this title, a letter should be addressed: "To His Excellency, the Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Monsignore N. . . ., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of . . ." and should end with the words: "Kissing his pastoral ring, I am His Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Excellency's very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and very obedient servant".



<p><em>Other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a></em>

<p>Moreover, custom requires that the title should be given to the four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> known in Italian as <em>di fiochetti </em>(those who have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to have tufts on their carriage-harness), namely: The Vice-Chamberlain, the Auditor of the <a href="../cathen/01633b.htm">Apostolic Chamber</a>, the Treasurer of the same Chamber (an office not filled since 1870), and the Majordomo. The other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> <em>di <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a>,</em> whether enrolled in a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or not, have the title of "Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lord." The letter should begin: "To the Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lord, Monsignore N. . . ." and end: "I am Your Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Lordship's very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant". In addressing a privy chamberlain, honorary chamberlain, or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, the term "Monsignore" should be used (in French <em>Monseigneur</em>) "Monsignore Reverendissimo" in Italian, and the letter should end: "I am Your Lordship's very devoted [or very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>] servant," according to the writer's rank.

<p><em>Religious</em>

<p>A religious should be addressed as "Reverend Father" or "Most Reverend Father" ("Reverendo padre" or "Reverendissimo Padre"), according to his rank in his order, and the words "Vostra Paternit&agrave;" or "Vostra Riverenza", "Your Paternity" or "Your Reverence", used in the letter itself. There are, indeed, certain fine distinctions to be made in the use of these expressions, according as the religious written to belongs to one order or another, but nowadays these chancery formulas, once clearly distinguished, are commonly used indiscriminately. In writing to one of a community of Brothers, such as the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, a simple religious should be addressed as "Very Dear Brother" (the customary form among the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>); should he hold a position in his congregation, as "Honoured Brother," or "Much Honoured Brother".

<p><em>Other titles</em>

<p>By the <em>motu proprio</em> of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (21 February, 1905), he conferred on vicars-general during their tenure of office the title "My Lord", on canons "Reverendo Signor, Don N. . . . canonico di . . .", in French "Monsieur le Chanoine", in English "The Very Reverend Canon". Consultors of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> have the title of "Most Reverend," and must be so addressed at the beginning and end of letters written to them.

<p><em>Priests</em>

<p>Lastly, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be addressed in Italian as "Reverendo Signor Parroco" or "Curato di", in French, as "Monsieur le Cur&eacute;", in English as "The Reverend A. . . . B. . . ." "Parish Priest" <em>(cur&eacute;)</em> is a general term. Most of the Italian provinces have special names for the office, such as "pievano", "prevosto", and others which it would take too long to enumerate, but "Reverendo Signor Parroco" may always be used safely. All <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> have the title "Don", an abbreviation of <em>Dominus</em> (Lord), and should therefore be addressed as "Reverendo Don" (or "D."); or, in the case of a doctor, "Reverendo [or Rev.] Dott., Don N. . . ." Various formulas of respect still occasionally used by Italian politeness may be noted, such as: "All' Ill' mo e Rev'mo Padrone [Pdne] Coltissimo [Colmo] ed Osservantissimo [Ossmo] Signor", titles without equivalent in French or English, now very rarely given, even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and which belong rather to the arch&aelig;ology of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> civility.
<h3>France</h3>

<p>The epistolary style of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is more simple. A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> should be addressed as "Eminence R&eacute;v&eacute;rendissime" (Most Reverend Eminence); not as "Monseigneur le Cardinal", the title "Monseigneur" being below the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> dignity. Only the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> said "Monsieur le Cardinal", the formula which the Pope uses when speaking to them &#151; "Signor Cardinale" &#151; but one of inferior rank should never presume to use this form of address, and will evade the difficulty by writing, "Eminence R&eacute;v&eacute;rendissime" at the beginning of a letter, in the body of the letter "Your Eminence" or "His Eminence"; at the end, "I have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be, with profound respect, Your Most Reverend Eminence's very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and very obedient servant" (J'ai l'honneur d'&ecirc;tre, avec un profond respect, de Votre Eminence R&eacute;vme. le tr&eacute;s <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> et tr&eacute;s ob&eacute;issant serviteur). Bishops in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> have the title of "Grandeur"; the envelope would, accordingly, be addressed: "A sa Grandeur, Monseigneur N., &eacute;v&ecirc;que de . . .", and the letter should end: "I have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be Your Grandeur's very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant". Prelates, vicars-general, and chamberlains should be called "Monseigneur" and, both in the letter itself and at the end, "Votre Seigneurie" ("Your Lordship"); religious "Reverend Father" or "Very Reverend Father", as the case may be; the words "Paternit&eacute;" and "R&eacute;v&eacute;rence" being but seldom used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> have the title "Dom", so that a religious of that order would be addressed as "The Rev. Father, Dom N. . . ." an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> as "The Right Rev. [Revme] Father, Dom N., <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of ----". There are, finally, the titles "Monsieur le Chanoine" and "Monsieur le Cur&eacute;", the latter being used for all <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
<h3>Spain</h3>

<p>The forms used in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> are as follows: "Emmo. y Revmo. Sr. Cardenal, Dr. D.N." [Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord Cardinal Doctor (if he have that title) Don N.] The letter should end with: "I <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> Your Eminence's pastoral ring, of whom I profess myself, with the deepest respect. . . ." The same formula is used in the case of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, only that the word "Excellency" takes the place of "Eminence". <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicars-general</a> have the title of "Most Illustrious", shortened into "Muy Iltr. Se&ntilde;or", which is also given to the great dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. In the letter itself, "Your Lordship" should be used, which is abbreviated into "V.S." (Vuestra Se&ntilde;or&iacute;a), nor must the academic titles of doctor or licentiate, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> addressed, be omitted, but they must precede the name, thus "Se&ntilde;or Doctor [or Se&ntilde;or Licenciado], Don" [abbreviated, D.], followed by the proper title of his charge. In the case of regulars the rule to be followed is that which has been indicated for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. All simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have the title of "Don".
<h3>Germany</h3>

<p>In writing to a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> one should address the envelope, "An seine Eminenz den hochw&uuml;rdigsten Herrn Kardinal N." ("To His Eminence the most worthy Lord Cardinal" &#151; <em>Herr,</em> of which <em>Herrn</em> is the accusative, meaning "Lord," or "Mister"). In the body of the letter the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> should be addressed as "Eminenz", and the ending should be: "Your Eminence's most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant" (Eurer Eminenz unterth nigster Diener). A Bishop has the title of "His Episcopal Grace" (Bisch fliche Gnaden), and his letter should be addressed, "An seine bisch flichen Gnaden den hochw&uuml;rdigsten Herrn" (To His Episcopal Grace the most worthy Lord); in the case of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, "Erzbisch&ouml;flichen" (<a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a>) is used instead of "Bisch&ouml;flichen"; in that of a prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "F&uuml;rstbisch&ouml;flichen". There are several sees in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> whose titulars have the rank of prince-bishops; such are <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, Gratz, <a href="../cathen/07088b.htm">Gurk</a>, <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Lavant</a>, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. The letter should end: "Your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Episcopal</a> [or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archiepiscopal</a>] Grace's most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant." It should be noted that in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the title of "Excellency" belongs only to those to whom it has been granted by the Government, so that it is well to ascertain whether the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> addressed has obtained it. A <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> <em>di <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a></em> should be addressed as "hochw&uuml;rdigster Herr Pr&auml;lat" (Most worthy Lord Prelate). There is no title in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> equivalent to that of the Monsignore given to chamberlains and Papal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>; it has, therefore become customary to address them as "Monsignore" or, if more respect is to be shown them, "An seine Hochw&uuml;rden, Monsignore" (His High Worthiness, Monsignore). "Hochw&uuml;rden" is also commonly used in the case of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the superlative, "hochw&uuml;rdigster", being applied to canons and great <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> dignitaries. Letters so addressed should end, "Your High Worthiness's [Euer Hochw&uuml;rden] very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant."
<h3>English-speaking countries</h3>

<p>"The Catholic Directory" (London, 1906) gives the following brief directions for forms of address, which, with the slight exceptions noted, may be safely taken as representing the best custom of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the British Isles, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and the British colonies in general: <blockquote> "CARDINALS. <em>His Eminence Cardinal . . .</em> If he is also an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>: <em>His Eminence the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of . . . ; </em>or <em>His Eminence <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> . . ., <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of . . . ; </em>[to begin a letter] <em>My Lord <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, </em>or <em>My Lord; Your Eminence.</em>

[It is, however, the usual custom in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.] When an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> or Bishop is mentioned by his surname, it is better to say <em><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> </em>(or <em>Bishop</em>) . . . than to say Dr. . . . ; for the latter title is common to Doctors of all kinds, and does not of itself indicate any sacred dignity or office. <em>"Vicars-General, Provosts, Canons.</em> - 1. <em>The Very Rev. A. B. </em>(or, if he is such, <em>Provost . . .</em>, or <em>Canon . . .</em>), <em>V.

The Right Rev. Abbot . . . </em>(surname). <em>Right Rev. Father. - Provincials. The Very Rev. Father . . . </em>(surname); or <em>The Very Rev. Father Provincial. Very Rev. Father. </em>- Some others (heads of colleges, etc.) are, at least by courtesy, addressed as <em>Very Reverend;</em> but no general rule can be given. The title of <em>Father</em> is very commonly given to Secular Priests, as well as to Priests of Religious Orders and Congregations. </blockquote>

<p>Even, however, with these explanations, which might have been developed at greater length, some difficulty may occasionally occur, in which case it is better to make a free use of titles of respect, rather than to run the risk of not using enough, and of thus falling short of what is due and fitting.
