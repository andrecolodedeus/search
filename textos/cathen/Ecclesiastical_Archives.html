<h1>Ecclesiastical Archives</h1>  

<p>Ecclesiastical archives may be described as a collection of documents, records, muniments, and memorials, pertaining to the origin, foundation, growth, history, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges, and constitutions of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the term is also applied to the place or depository where such records and documents are kept.

<p>The word <em>archive</em> is derived from the Latin <em>archium, archivum</em>, post-classical terms. Cicero uses <em>tabularium</em>, and Pliny <em>tablinum.</em> Pomponius Mela (A.D.37-54) seems among the first to adopt <em>archium</em> in the sense of archives (De orbis situ, lib. III). <em>Archivum</em> appears twice in <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (A.D. 150-230). <em>Archium</em> (<em>archivum</em>) is a transliteration of the Greek <em>Archeion</em>, used among the Greeks to express the senate-house, the council-house; the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of magistrates convened therein; the place reserved for state papers; the documents themselves; and, finally, applied to many sanctuaries, which became the depositories of documents important enough to hand down to posterity. Not only Greece, but also the ancient civilizations of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> appreciated the value of preserving important records and usually reserved for the archives a part of the temple, the sacredness of the holy place guaranteeing, as far as possible, immunity from violation. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, impressed with the reverence and importance attached by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> to such depositories, and recognizing the need of proper and safe custody of the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, sought out for this purpose, in the beginning, the home of some worthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian family</a>, and later, during the persecutions, some secret chamber in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. In these primitive archives the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> placed the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a>. St. Clement (A.D. 93), the fourth of the Roman Pontiffs, appointed for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> seven notaries to record for future ages the sayings and sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. <a href="../cathen/01553a.htm">Pope Anterus</a> (235-236) displayed such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the keeping of these records of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as to win for himself a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown after but one month in the Chair of Peter; and tradition tells of the existence, even in his day, of archives in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>.

<p>In the development of the polity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the first councils determined the relation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to assign to a special official, in a place separate from the depository for the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of registering ordinations, the issuing of dimissory letters, the recording of synodal and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees, and the safe keeping of documents pertaining to the administration and temporalities of the church. This official keeper of the archives, who became the registrar of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was called in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <em>tabularius</em>, and in Constantinople <em>chartophylax</em>. The <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325), judging from its sixteenth canon, felt the need of such a church official. The Council of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a> (402), in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, prescribed <em><a href="../cathen/10052a.htm">matricula</a></em>, or archives, for records of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, to prevent disputes about seniority among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The famous canonist, Van Espen, commenting on the ninth canon of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (787) writes that in the palace of the patriarch of Constantinople were kept the archives, called the <em>chartophylacium</em>, in which the episcopal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and documents containing the privileges and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the church were laid up. Frequently, important State papers and valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of profane literature were preserved in the archives of the church; the Code of Justinian was therein deposited by order of the Emperor. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were quick to follow the example of the episcopal cities in the keeping of archives. Monastic archives owe much to the introduction of the <em>scriptorium</em> (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> room) with its <em>armaria</em> (book-chests) into <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> by St. Benedict (529) and into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Viviers</a> by its famous <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Cassiodorus (531). The preservation of the fragments of Greek and Roman classics now extant is largely due to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which for twelve centuries from the fall of the Western Empire were the custodians, not only of sacred <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> but also of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the ancient Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and the Latin rhetoricians. A <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was often rich in archives, containing rare <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, beautiful chirographs, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, precious metal-ware, and documents pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a people, the privileges of kings, and treaties between nations. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of the thirteenth century, as Bologna and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, products of the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, maintained valuable archives.

<p>In 1587, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of erecting in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a general <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> depository to serve for archives for all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; the plan, however, was not found practicable, and the Pontiff then decreed that each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community should establish and maintain its own local archives. The most detailed legislation with regard to the erection, the arrangement, and the safe custody of archives is embodied in the Constitution "Maxima Vigilantia" of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1727), the norm for the present discipline in this matter. As a result of mandatory decrees of provincial and synodal councils, archives are now found in every well organized centre. Besides the Vatican archives and those of the various <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, there are: <ul> <li>the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, archives, wherein are preserved the acts of provincial councils; documents concerning suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>; records of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; minutes of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> trials, of appeals, and of matrimonial processes before the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> curia, or court; <li>the episcopal, or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives, containing acts of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, documents from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the minutes of the episcopal curia, records of ordinations and matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, deeds of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and reports of the spiritual and financial condition of every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> archives, maintained in each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for safely and securely keeping all documents pertaining to the origin and history of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, mandates and pastorals of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, registers for an accurate record of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, confirmations, marriages and deaths, and of the spiritual condition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> visited in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; also the books pertaining to the administration of the finances of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, with detailed inventory of all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> usually considers <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> registers as authentic public records. </ul>
