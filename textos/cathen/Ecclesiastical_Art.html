<h1>Ecclesiastical Art</h1>  

<p>Before speaking in detail of the developments of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> from the beginning down to the present day, it seems natural to say something in regard to the vexed question as to the source of its inspiration. It would not be possible here to treat adequately all the various theories which have been propounded, but the essentials of the controversy may be given in a few words. Afterwards there will be some mention of the principal works which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity has left to us and a setting forth of the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in stimulating and directing that artistic spirit which for so many centuries it alone was destined to keep alive.
<h2>Origin of Christian art</h2>

<p>There has been much discussion of late years as to the influences which were predominant in the development of early <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. Professor Wickhoff in a striking essay (Roman Art, tr., 1900) has contended that in the first century after Christ a distinctively Roman style was evolved both in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, the salient features of which he characterizes as impressionist or "illusionist". He marks several stages in the growth of this style, and claims for it especially the creation of what he calls the continuous method of composition, i.e. a method by which several successive stages of the same history are depicted together in a single <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. Further, he contends that this Roman style was adopted by the first <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian artists</a> and that, though obscured and weakened, it persuaded the Roman world and maintained its identity throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> until eventually it quickened again into fuller life under the stimulus of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>.

<p>This view, an exaggeration of the Romanist hypothesis which long held the field has been severely criticized by many competent authorities and notably by Strzygowski ("Orient oder Rom", 1901, and "Kleinasien", 1903), who attributes the predominantly influence in the development of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> to the recrudescence of purely Oriental feeling. This, as he maintained, had always survived at Byzantium, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and Alexandria, and it became operative once more when the Graeco-Roman artistic tradition at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had exhausted itself after the effort of a few centuries. Though Strzygowski may go too far when he claims that even the art of the Romanized provinces like Gaul came from the East direct and not through <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it seems highly probable that his contention is in substance accurate enough.

<p>To <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> must be assigned the prevalence of the basilica type of church and the first effective conception of the possibilities of stone vaulting. But the transference of the seat of government by Honorius in 404 from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and the confusion that arose in the Western Roman Empire, had far-reaching consequences upon the development of art. If <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was at all times the seat of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the vicars of Christ had not at this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> acquired any preponderating influence in the social and civil affairs of the Western world, while more than a hundred years after this beginning with the seventh century, no less than thirteen pontiffs who occupied in succession the chair of St. Peter were of Greek or Syrian origin. But what is perhaps most important of all, the Latin stock who occupied what was once the great city, but what now became only a provincial town, were morally and intellectually effete. The motive power for a new development was to come from outside. The impetuous energy of the Teutonic tribes of the North was full of latent possibilities for the arts of peace, when that energy was once diverted from the strenuous occupations of a time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Once again "Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit", but it was Greece enriched this time with the inheritance of Antioch, Ephesus, and Alexandria, while the culture that now travelled west. and north found ultimately a more responsive soil than it had ever met with in Latium. In its adoption by <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and Saxons the art of Byzantium lost its rigidity, and something of its formalism. It was a living germ which soon developed an independent growth, and long before the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> once more directed the minds of men to classic models, not only architecture and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, but the arts of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, the iron-worker, the goldsmith. and the glass founder were full of vigorous life and promise throughout all Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The earliest specimens of decorations employed for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> purpose are found in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>. In the most ancient examples of all the private chambers used for <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian interment</a> in the first and second centuries, there is decoration indeed, but it is only in a negative sense that it can be called <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, for while the abundant frescoes seen in the cemetery of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a> and notably in the cubiculum of Ampliatus exclude such <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> elements as would be unseemly, the character of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is in every respect the counterpart of the ornamentation of the contemporary private houses buried at Pompeii. There is nothing distinctively <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Perhaps the frequent recurrence of the vine as a principal element in the scheme of decoration may have been meant to suggest the thought of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine, but even this is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">Symbolism</a> occurs early, but it can only be recognized with confidence in the more public cemeteries of the second century, e.g. that of St. Callistus; here, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">"Discipline of the Secret"</a>, it is hardly wrong to recognize the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beginnings of a distinctively <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this art in a most marked degree was imitative of the more decent forms of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> decoration familiar at the period. It seems constantly to be forgotten by those who discuss this subject that it was the deliberate object of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, during the ages of suspicion and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to exclude from their places of sepulture all that would by its conspicuousness or strangeness attract the notice of the casual <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> intruder. No wonder that the theme of the Good Shepherd in introduced again and again in the fresco decorations of the early <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. This is no indication as <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> critics have sometimes pretended, of the survival of an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> mythology, but the very likeness of the beardless Good Shepherd to the type of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Hermes Kriophorus &#151; a likeness, however, which is never so exact as to lead to real confusion &#151; constituted its recommendation to those who wished to hide their distinctive practices from the prying eyes of the people around them. In the same way the Orante, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> figure, symbolical of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, bore a general resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Pietas, familiar enough to the ordinary Roman citizen, while the dove, which was to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> eloquent of the grace of the Holy Spirit, would not have been distinguished by his <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> neighbour from the birds <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Venus. The deeper mysteries of the Eucharist and of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were still more artfully veiled in the frescoes of those early centuries. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the fish was an object familiar enough in all kinds of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> decoration, but that very fact rendered it most suitable for the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> when he wished to symbolize the marvellous workings of Christ (<em>Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter = <a href="../cathen/06083a.htm">ICHTHYS</a></em>, the fish) in the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. What again was more common in decoration than some form of banqueting scene &#151; a theme also often utilized by the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a>-- but these feasts depicted upon the walls of a sepulchral chamber had a far other and deeper significance for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, who by some minute sign, the little cross, it may be, impressed upon the loaves, or the fishes which decked the frugal board, was quick to discern the reference to the life-giving mystery of the Blessed Eucharist. There are also human figures and Biblical scenes, especially those connected with the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> for the departed &#151; for example the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> restorations of Jonah and Daniel and Lazarus &#151; and in one or two isolated instances we may perhaps recognize a presentment of the Madonna, but the reference is always cryptic and only interpretable by the initiated. It was under these circumstances that the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> of religious symbolism was developed when the art of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was yet in its infancy but the tradition thus created has never departed from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> throughout the ages. With the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under Constantine the necessity for the sedulous hiding of the mysteries of the Faith in large measure disappeared. From A.D. 313 to the end of the fifth century was a period of transformation and development in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, and it may be conspicuously recognized upon the walls of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>. Biblical scenes abound, and the figure of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no longer so frequently as the beardless Good Shepherd, but <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with a nimbus and sitting or standing in the attitude of authority, is fearlessly introduced. The nimbus is also extended to others beside Christ, for example to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Sculpture again, though in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> the traces it has left are relatively few now for the first time becomes the helpmate of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This is the age of the great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sarcophagi so wonderfully decorated with the figures of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and with biblical scenes still full of symbolic meaning. The old ways of the period of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had, it is plain, become not only familiar but dear to the body of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The allegorical method of representing the mysteries of the Faith did not disappear at once. But though with the triumph of Constantine the outline of the "chrisme" (<em>chi-rho</em>), or the Greek monogram of Christ, was universally held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and introduced into all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments and even into the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, the crucifix as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emblem was as yet practically unknown. For more than a century the memory of the Sacrifice of Calvary was recalled to the minds of the faithful only by some such device as that of a plain cross impressed with the figure of a lamb. The first representations of the figure of the Saviour nailed upon the Rood, as we see it upon the carved doors of Sta. Sabina in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in the British Museum <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, belong probably to the fifth century, but for a long period after that this subject is very rarely found, and its occurrence in frescoes or <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> is hardly recorded anywhere before the time of Justinian (527 - 565).


<h2>Mosaics and other early Christian arts</h2>

<p>To find the beginning of the use of colour in the Roman Empire to anything like an important extent, we must look at the Roman pavements composed of myriads of tesserae, and representing in a flat and somewhat uninteresting manner mystic beings, extraordinary animals, fruits, flowers, and designs. Between these Roman pavements and one branch of the earliest <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>, there is a very close connexion.

<p>It seems also possible that some of the early efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> are to be found in the decorations of gold on glass which have been discovered in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. Upon these glasses dating from the third to the fifth century, are found representations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, as well as drawings in gold-leaf, partly symbolic and partly realistic, referring to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the emblems of the Seven Spirits, a future life, and the events narrated in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Simple and archaic as these are, yet many of them show considerable beauty. The primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> included within itself, not only the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, but <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of distinction, rank, and attainment, and it is clear from an examination of these drawings that some were executed by those who were in possession of considerable artistic skill, and who had been trained in a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Roman art.

<p>Contemporaneous with these, and earlier, are frescoes <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> upon the walls of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, including <a href="../cathen/12294b.htm">portraits of the Apostles</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, representations of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, naive pictures of the scenes from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a>, and simple illuminatory symbolism.

<p>Then, between the fourth and tenth centuries there is a long series of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, in which for the first time strong evidence appears of a sense of colour. A few specimens of these <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> adorned the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, afterwards they are found in the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> and places of worship of the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was speedily recognized that <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> decoration possessed certain strong claims to attention, such as other methods of decoration lacked. While the artist himself must be responsible for fresco work, very much of the labour in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> decoration could be left to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of subordinate position, and once the artist had drawn out the pattern and scheme which was to cover, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the church, the actual manual labour of fitting in the <em>tesserae</em> could be done by workmen. Then, again, there was the quality of imperishability; the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> was as permanent, an actual part of the structure which it decorated; it did not vary in colour by reason of light or atmosphere, and could be cleansed from time to time. It was also capable of strong, broad effects, rendering it peculiarly suitable to positions at the end of a building, somewhat above the line of sight, and its colour could be made so emphatic and so brilliant that the darkest of curves or hollows could be lit up by its luminous beauty.

<p>It is small wonder, therefore, that from the very earliest period the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> drew to itself the skilful workers in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>, and employed them, as can be seen by the wonderful remains at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, on <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>, near Constantinople, and notably at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to decorate the interiors of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, and to portray upon their walls the emblems of the Divine tragedy, of the Sufferings of Christ and of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or to represent in hieratic magnificence the figures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or in benediction, so that the scenes might be well in sight of all the worshippers within the little churches. From the representation of single figures at the end of the church, the work speedily spread to more elaborate adornment of the walls and from the simplicity of a single emblem, a single figure, the artistic spirit grew until it represented in pictorial effect the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or spread long triumphant processions of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, along the walls of the <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> of the larger churches.

<p>There is no city in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in which this earliest <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> can be so well studied as at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The difficult of approaching the place in its out-of-the-way position has enabled it to retain and preserve the monument which it is so rich, and which relate so exclusively to its early history. The <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> dates back to the last years of the fourth century and was later ornamented in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. There is in it a representation of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and a circle of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>; the figures, of surpassing dignity, appear to move round the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> with a swing and grace very remarkable in effect. Another circle of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> decorations in the same building represents the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Books of the Gospels</a> open upon four altars, and between them four thrones of dominion with crosses; these <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> have never been restored, and are in the condition in which their makers left them. The huge font intended for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by immersion, which stands below them, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their antiquity, but the actual inscription of <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> with its <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> still exists on the metal cross surmounting the building. In the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace are <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the fifth century made during the reign of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="../cathen/11762c.htm">St. Peter Chrysologus</a>, while in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Empress Galla Placidia are <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> decorations of her period; unfortunately, many of these latter works have been restored. The very finest <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, however relate to the great <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. In the time of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, the old <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was beginning once more to make itself felt. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had long been dead, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had fought his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> battle against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a>, the Councils of <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a> and Constantinople had been held, and had pronounced against it, and the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had been confirmed, so that within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> could no longer exist, but outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there were still those who practiced it. When <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, king of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, came into power, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> became once more a force to be reckoned with, and the emperor erected a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and a <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> for his <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is in the church now called Sant' Apollinare Nuovo, which was new more than a thousand years ago, that the great rhythmic array of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alluded to above exists, the greater part of it as it was when <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> erected the church fourteen centuries ago. In the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, near by, the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> upon the roof were put in place practically after the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> from about 550.

<p>It is not only, however, in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, that <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> illustrates the early <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; one of its great treasures, the <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> chair of St. Maximianus (546-556), made in the first half of the sixth century, has been in the city since it was first carved with the exception of a very short time when it was carried to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1001. It is perhaps the finest example in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of such <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory carving</a>, and was the work of Oriental craftsmen who entered into the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and carved this chair with its delicate and beautiful illustrations of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the history of Joseph.

<p>The same city can illustrate other branches of applied <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> for the orphreys and textile fabrics made for San Giovanni in the fifth century, the sixth-century <a href="../cathen/01352a.htm">altar-cross</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, St. Agnellus (556-659), his <a href="../cathen/12448a.htm">processional cross</a> of silver, and portions of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir are still preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, while the art of carving in marble of the same period is exceedingly well exemplified by the splendid stone sarcophagi existing in various churches of the city. Following the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> came the rule of the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> (527-565), and the episcopate of St. Ecclesius (521-34), while the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> decoration in the church of San Vitale, done in the early and middle part of the sixth century, illustrate the change from <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the exquisite beauty of the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> work the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was able to make use of at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>A little journey outside <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> to the church of Sant' Apollinare in Classe will enable the student to bring his study of early <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> work and earlier <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> down to a still later period, as in that church there is the great <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> erected by Archbishop Reparatus c. 671, the curved throne of St. Damianus (668-705), and the sarcophagi of various <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, extending in <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to the end of the seventh century, and bearing religious emblems of very considerable importance. Attention should also be drawn to the pictures on unprepared linen cloth, executed in a material similar to transparent watercolour, ascribed to a period antecedent to the third century, they chiefly purport to be representations of the features of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The most notable of course is the one known as the Handkerchief of St. Veronica, preserved in the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a>, and which none but an ecclesiastic of very high rank is allowed to examine closely. Although the most important, it is by no means the only example of such a picture. There is another in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, a third in the church of San Silvestro in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and others in various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> shrines.

<p>The metal work executed during the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> occupation of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was often work commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for use in the ceremonials of the service, and figures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, ornaments for <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">copes</a>, chasses in which to put <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and vessels for use at the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, belonging to this period of primitive <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> are the direct result of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As, however, the religious feeling, spread more and more, the desire arose among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to have artistic representations of the great events of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in their houses, and it is possible that the beginnings of what we may term portable pictorial work arose in this way. The very early tempera <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> on wood of Eastern and Byzantine character, some of which are actually ascribed to the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> St. Luke himself, may very likely have been executed, not entirely as decorations for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but that the wealthier members of the community, at least, might have in their homes, in the privacy of their own <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, some cherished representation of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Man of Sorrows</a> himself, or of some <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> or saint from whom the owner was named, or towards whom he had some particular affection. In this way may perhaps be traced the beginning of the history of the icons which are so important a feature in the life of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, and which adorn every house, in many cases being found in all the rooms occupied by the various members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.
<h2>Ecclesiastical art in the Middle Ages</h2>

<p>Leaving primitive times, the period of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> is one of enormous artistic importance, and it is an era in which the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is practically paramount.

<p>To this period there does not belong any very long series of artistic objects relating exclusively to domestic life. There were, of course, articles of domestic interest marked by artistic skill, there were objects of personal decoration and appliances for use in the home; but the choicest talent and the efforts of the most supreme genius were almost invariably given to the work of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and even where the commissions related to domestic ornamentation, there was generally a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> element in the decorations and the use of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> symbolisms.
<h3>Enamels</h3>

<p>To this period belong the magnificent work in enamels executed for church work. There are the tall pricket <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlesticks</a>, superb chasses and <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/01352a.htm">altar-crosses</a>, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosiers</a>, shrines, <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a> and incense boats, crucifixes, <a href="../cathen/10577c.htm">morses</a> for <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">copes</a> and medallions for <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, triptychs and polyptychs for use on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, plaques for book-covers, especially for the adornment of the Book of the Gospels, <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruets</a>, <a href="../cathen/02334a.htm">basins</a>, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, and book-binding in metal encrusted with jewels.

<p>The very first British enamels were merely a kind of coarse decoration, applied to the adornment of shields and helmets, but later on to cups, vases, and drinking-vessels, but, when mention is made of the <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">Chalice</a> and the Alfred Jewel, it will be realized that a period in enamel work has been reached when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> laid its hand upon the craft. Concerning the use of the Alfred Jewel, it may be broadly stated that the most probable theory is that it was the ornament applied to the head of an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> pointer used by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> when reading the Book of the Gospels, and that therefore this exquisite object now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford is one of the earliest examples of ecclesiastical enamel work. The <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">Chalice</a>, of translucent enamels on silver and gold, is only one of a group of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> shrines, <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>, missal-covers, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosiers</a>, and crosses, similarly decorated, and it would appear likely that these <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> or Celtic enamels, of which half a dozen adorn the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of <a href="../cathen/01388c.htm">Sant' Ambrogio</a> in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, are perhaps among the earliest existing examples of the art in connexion with ecclesiastical possessions.

<p>In the first part of the eleventh century, Byzantium appears to have been the headquarters of the work of ecclesiastical enameling, and the <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> in the South Kensington Museum maybe taken as an example of early Byzantine work. The art of the enameller was also in existence in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and here also was applied exclusively to ecclesiastical objects. Towards the middle of the twelfth century the workers of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> came into prominence, and from that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> down to the end of the thirteenth <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> was the centre of production. In Italian enameling, the wonderful translucent <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>, dated 1338, the work of Ugolino of Siena, in which is preserved the great <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Corporal at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, is a masterpiece of the craft. The <a href="../cathen/01353b.htm">altar-frontal</a> at Pistoja belongs to about the same period, and a little later comes the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> made by the brothers <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, while during the whole of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the enamellers were kept hard at work in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> producing objects intended for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> work in two or three distinct processes, either that called champleve, or another method, that of floating transparent enamels, known by the name of bassetaille, or still another process called encrusting. At the end of the fifteenth century, and the beginning of the sixteenth, in the era of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, the art left <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and, taking a new form, that of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> enamels, or more strictly, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in enamels, had a recrudescence in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the very same place, <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, in which the old enamels had been produced.
<h3>Embroidery</h3>

<p>In another division of applied arts are the remarkable <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroideries</a> which adorned all the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>, representing in the most wonderful pictorial effect, groups of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, sacred scenes, and religious symbols. On the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasubles</a>, <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">copes</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">albs</a>, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stoles</a>, <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniples</a>, <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burses</a>, veils, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitres</a>, frontals, super-frontals, and altar-covers, <a href="../cathen/11423b.htm">palls</a>, bags, and panels of that period, are to be seen triumphs of artistic excellence, worked with exceeding beauty, and with a glorious richness of colour, by the hands of the faithful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the day and designed by the men of supreme genius whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had attracted to her side.

<p>Some of the very finest of this <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> work was English, and references are found to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> before the end of the seventh century, as, <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13756c.htm">Sherborne</a>, celebrated in verse the skilful work of the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroideresses</a>. Indeed, at one time, rather too much attention in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> seems to have been given to this fascinating <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">needlework</a>, for a council held in 747 recommended that the reading of books and psalm-singing by the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> should receive greater attention, and that not quite so many hours should be spent in <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">needlework</a>. As early as 855 the Anglo-Saxon King Ethelwulf when journeying to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> took with him as presents silken <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> richly <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> in gold, executed in his own country, and there are <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> and <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> (d. 687) which were produced under the auspices of the wife of Edward the Elder in 916 and placed in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> coffin. From that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> down to the middle of the sixteenth century there was a constant demand for the work of the skilled <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroideresses</a>, and this section of art, so particularly suitable to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes, was one of perennial richness. It is well that some stress should be laid upon the question of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, inasmuch as in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was almost exclusively a branch of ecclesiastical art, and nearly everything that can be termed of importance in fine <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, especially in fine <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> previous to the fifteenth century, was executed for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Enormous labour was given to the production of these beautiful <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and as an example it may be mentioned that a frontal presented to the <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Abbey of Westminster</a> in 1271 took the whole labour of four <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> for three years and three-quarters. <a href="../cathen/09266b.htm">Lincoln</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> in the fourteenth century possessed over six hundred <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> in its <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Abbey of Westminster</a> had very nearly double as many, and even the English churches were far behind those of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the sumptuous manner in which they were supplied with <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>.

<p>There was therefore every possible <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for the work, and no branch of art has a greater importance between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries than has this one of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>. Fortunately, a sufficient number of the old <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> have come down to the present day to give a satisfactory <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their importance and beauty and the records and inventories of church goods prior to the sixteenth century afford still further information concerning this branch of art.
<h3>Motivating spirit</h3>

<p>The spirit of devotion which has ever given the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> to decorate the house of God with the very finest works of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is capable led to this lavish display of artistic genius in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but it must also be borne in mind that there were other, subordinate causes to account for the work. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, following its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Master</a>, has always inculcated the importance of good works and it has ever encouraged the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to give to its service of their best. If their skill was in <a href="../cathen/10218a.htm">metal-work</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15698b.htm">carving wooden figures</a> or wonderful <a href="../cathen/14243a.htm">choir-stalls</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a>, in jewelry, in fresco or in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> such skill was to be devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service as the choicest gift the artist had to lay upon the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> symbolic of his devotion to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Even beyond that, there came the occasions in which the penance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> took the form of the devotion of artistic gifts to the work of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the other and very numerous cases in which this artistic labour was the constant employment of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had devoted their entire life to the religious career, in the various <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> belonging to the different orders. One further cause must not be overlooked, the fact that it was the Crown, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the nobility who alone could command, by reason of their means, the splendid productions of the men of genius of the time, and that while the commissions given by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> would most certainly be for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> purposes almost exclusively, those given by the Crown and the higher nobility were in almost all instances for exactly the same purposes, and this for a double reason.

<p>First, the desire to render the home beautiful had not yet arisen to any considerable extent, and secondly, there was every wish to make the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a>, the public church or royal sanctuary, as beautiful as possible, both to carry out the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> of the religious feeling and please those who held control of spiritual things, as well as to heap up a reward for good deeds which would have a corresponding equivalent in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">future life</a> and might serve as retribution for the deeds of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> that formed so integral a part of the life of these centuries. The period under consideration was not so much one of portable pictures as of applied art, devoted to the interior decoration of the sacred buildings and to every object having connexion with the service of the altar.
<h3>Monastic anonymity</h3>

<p>One section of ecclesiastical art deserving special mention concerns almost exclusively the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> orders, namely, that of <a href="../cathen/09620a.htm">illumination</a> and transcription. All over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">pre-Renaissance time</a> were engaged in preparing the books of the day and these books were almost exclusively religious ones. The number of those concerning domestic matters, agriculture, or the classics, transcribed by these diligent students, is relatively small, but the series of religious works from their diligent pens is an exceedingly long one. Their time was fully occupied in preparing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for use within the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and for the service of the altar, as well as for the great patrons of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> who desired to have books of devotion for their own use, or for gifts to other sovereigns or noblemen. These <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are of incomparable beauty, being transcribed with extraordinary skill upon the finest of vellum, and adorned with initial letters, calendars, and illustrations, that are triumphs of artistic skill, and marvels of ingenuity.

<p>The Books of Hours, <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missals</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviaries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> having their origin in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> are now among the greatest artistic treasures of the world and with regard to them there is one very striking fact which must never be overlooked. This does not relate exclusively to books of devotion, it belongs nearly as much to every work of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> produced during this period, and it is the fact that these triumphs of skill are for the most part anonymous. In the period hardly any great names are recorded in connexion with such work. There is a wonderful series of artistic treasures, but signatures scarcely ever exist. Here and there the name of an enameller is known or perchance the name of the place where he worked, occasionally the name of a <a href="../cathen/15698b.htm">wood-carver</a> or a worker in <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> has been preserved and there are just a few cases in which the name of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who toiled over the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is known, but the instances are exceedingly few, and they occur, one might say, by accident rather than by intention.

<p>With respect to illuminations in books of devotion, one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> took up the task where the other had left it. Death <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> no cessation of the self-imposed labour. The orders could never die, and as in the present day great literary works are undertaken by the leading orders, in the full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that to carry them out will extend far beyond the life of the writer who begins the undertaking, but that his successor will be equally able to continue the task. So in the earlier days the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> laboured in their <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, each at his own work; each generation of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the footsteps of the former, hiding the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> identity in the name of the order and content, as the work was done for the greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that while the work should remain, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves should be forgotten.

<p>Few things are more striking in considering this period than the singleness of aim and devotion to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> which characterized these artists and led them to have no desire to perpetuate their own names, but simply to carry out to the best of their abilities, the allotted task for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Partly, of course, the reason was that the dignity of personal labour was not fully realized, but the reason for this anonymity lies mainly in the facts already stated, that the work was religious work that the aim was a religious aim, and that the identity of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> did not <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, so long as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was properly served by her faithful.
<h3>Desire for perfection</h3>

<p>There is one other aspect of the artistic work of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">pre-Renaissance time</a> to be alluded to. It is by no means confined to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">pre-Renaissance period</a>, but extends through the succeeding centuries, and it should extend to all the artistic labour of the present day, but it is more especially a feature of the period under discussion. It is that determination which is nearer satisfied with the work which has been done, but which is always straining forward for finer and better work. It is that element of untiring energy and ever-quickening desire for perfection which has always characterized the greatest art-workers of the world, and it finds its earliest and perhaps its strongest development in this period.
<h3>Early Italian painters</h3>

<p>The early <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> fall into two groups: the first, that which may be called the group of the miniaturists or illuminators, as, for example, Enrico, Berlinghieri, and Oderico; the second, the very primitive <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, such as, Margaritone, Spinello, <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Uccello</a>, <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a>, <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>, <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Memmi</a>, <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Lorenzetti</a>, and the various early masters of the schools of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. The predecessors of these artists for the most part, worked without any reference to nature, under Byzantine influence, copying slavishly the methods fixed by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. Their pictures, whether they illustrated scenes from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Writings</a>, the legends of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, were designed and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> according to fixed rules. Their work was inferior to that of the Byzantine workers in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>, but followed the same conceptions of art; in every way, in attitudes, compositions, types of face, folds of drapery, and even as regards colour, it was guided by the definite rules of tradition, so that the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> was little more than a mechanic. Still, despite what may be termed the ugliness of this particular school, there was a strong spirit of devotion exercising the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the artists, and they were able to put a certain amount of sympathy into their hard, angular productions, thus showing that their works were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> with religious sentiment, and with a desire to evoke that sentiment in others. Margaritone was one of the first to break through the hard crust of rules, and although his work does not show any very striking advance upon that of his predecessors, yet in his pictures and in those of the earliest <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, we begin to find the desire to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> a Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bearing some living semblance to a Mother of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. There is a struggling towards tenderness and sweetness of countenance, a desire to represent raiment gently floating in easy curves, and a greater command of sentiment, together with a simplicity in story-telling, which mark this primitive school, and prepare the way for the forerunner of natural treatment, <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> himself.
<h2>Period of the Renaissance</h2>

<p>The great era of transition from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to modern times which is called the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> may be divided into the three periods of the Early Renaissance, Full Renaissance, and Late Renaissance. Here again the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is found just as strong and as defined as in the past. The growing desire to have magnificent churches created the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> for other workers in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a>.

<p>The first years of this period give in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the earliest workers known by name in fresco, and in portable pictures, <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a>, <a href="../cathen/11275b.htm">Orcagna</a>, <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, and others. In their "frescoed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>", decorating the churches of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and other parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is seen the beginning of the long list of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> enlisted in her service.

<p>In bronze work <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a> produced the gates of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of Florence and with the appearance of <a href="../cathen/03008c.htm">Brunelleschi</a> a new school of architecture for ecclesiastical buildings arose.

<p>In this period belongs also the introduction of printing and here again, just as emphatically, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> took the lead. The earliest printers mere Churchmen belonging to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order; the earliest books those of religion &#151; the first actual printed sheet being the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> &#151; followed by a long list of religious and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works, <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">patristic</a> literature.

<p>In the Low Countries the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eycks</a> developed the methods of oil-painting and there arose a great school of artists, among whom were Van der Goes, <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Van der Weyden</a>, Bouts, Cristus, <a href="../cathen/10172c.htm">Memling</a>, and others who formed the transition from the Gothic school. Their most important works were <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altarpieces</a>, and in some cases all their <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> were of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> character, while in others the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> not religious were portraits of the various patrons who had commissioned the altar-pieces, or who had their own private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> decorated by these artists, therefore the intimate connexion between <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was just as close as ever.

<p>Towards the close of the Early Renaissance period is found the work in <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> and those of his school, <a href="../cathen/13741a.htm">Desiderio da Settignano</a>, the <a href="../cathen/16072a.htm">Rossellini</a>, <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>, Verrochio, and <a href="../cathen/16063c.htm">Mino da Fiesole</a> almost all the fine work of these men was for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes. Here and there are single detached <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, as for example the one of <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> by <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, but then it must be remembered that these were figures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and intended for buildings more or less of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, or for those erected by <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">guilds</a> distinctly religious, while some of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> named, as for example <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, were only known by the work they executed for the decoration of churches.

<p>During this period among the workers in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were <a href="../cathen/08695b.htm">Adam Kraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/14310a.htm">Veit Stoss</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15475a.htm">Vischers</a>, who are associated with the superb tabernacle, the series of <a href="../cathen/15569a.htm">Stations of the Cross</a> and the great bronze shrine in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, all objects intimately connected with religious work. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Henry VI and that of Henry VII by Torrigiano, both at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> must not be overlooked.

<p>Every branch of artistic craftsmanship was at this time employed for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Finiguerra, <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>, and others were at work at the great silver <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of the Florentine <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>. The jewelers, Ghirlandajo, Verrochio and <a href="../cathen/06206b.htm">Francia</a> were making jewels for <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, medals for the great <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and pictures for the churches; <a href="../cathen/13095b.htm">Luca della Robbia</a> was preparing his vitrified enamel medallions, that he might present the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Child</a> in attitudes of the most perfect tenderness on the exteriors of the churches and on the corners of the streets, while other potters were marking the sacred emblems on their finest productions, or <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> religious scenes upon their vases and majolica plates.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the English <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestries</a> of Coventry, and the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eyck</a> <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, were being woven for the hangings of the churches, while <a href="../cathen/09556a.htm">Benedetto da Maiano</a> was bringing his intarsia work to perfection that he might apply it to the decoration of the <a href="../cathen/14243a.htm">choir-stalls</a> in the great churches of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It was at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> that the great <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a> decorated the cells of San Marco with his perfect representations of the great events in the Divine Tragedy, while <a href="../cathen/06688b.htm">Gozzoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Lippi</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06545a.htm">Ghirlandajo</a> adorned the churches, and <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a>, <a href="../cathen/06206b.htm">Francia</a>, Albertinelli and <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolomeo</a>, almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">religious painters</a>, prepared those masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> to set upon the altars of the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and great churches of the day, that are now among the treasured masterpieces of all <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>This era was also the period of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, of the return to the love of the classics. It may be difficult in this complex period to mark the boundary line between religion and that strange <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> which was an emblem of the classical revival, but the Certosa of Pavia and the work of the early German <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, represented by such men as <a href="../cathen/13553c.htm">Schongauer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">elder Holbein</a>, mark that side by side with the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanistic</a> movement there was a strong religious one. In this religious movement <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> had its full share, and engaged in its tasks, not perhaps with the austere simplicity and singleness of aim which belonged to an earlier period, but still with a definite determination that the best products of artistic craftsmanship should be devoted to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>There was, however, a growing desire that the home should be more beautiful and more luxurious. The decoration of churches was ceasing to be the sole aim of the art-worker, and he was finding other fields, but the chief encouragement of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> still came from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and even upon domestic work the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> set her hand and seal.

<p>The period of the Full Renaissance may be taken as lasting from 1450 to 1550, and here must be noticed the advent of a new movement in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a>, or at least a stronger development of what had undoubtedly begun to arise in the previous century. Hitherto, in pictorial art, notably in that of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the aims had been form drawing, composition, devotion and the expression of spiritual conceptions rather than colour; but in the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> School, that took its rise in the earlier century with the first <a href="../cathen/02416b.htm">Bellini</a>, <a href="../cathen/03373c.htm">Carpaccio</a> and <a href="../cathen/04509a.htm">Crivelli</a>, and that was to see its development at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in the later <a href="../cathen/02416b.htm">Bellini</a>, <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione</a>, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14737a.htm">Tintoretto</a>, the claims of colour gain a supremacy over the kindred branches of pictorial art. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> School is the one in which brilliant colour attains to its apotheosis; and everything else is subservient to it.

<p>The simplicity of aim which characterized such a man as <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a> passed away, the devotional feeling that marked the works of Albertinelli and <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolomeo</a> gave place to an overpowering desire for decoration as such, and in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> commissioned the great altar-pieces and the schemes of interior ornamentation for which these noble artists were responsible, it had to be content to accept <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> tradition and to see religious scenes treated as gorgeous pieces of sumptuously coloured decoration.

<p>Although there might not be the simplicity of a past generation, yet there still existed in the artists the same desire to offer to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the greatest works of their genius. In this period of the Full Renaissance are found the work of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>; of <a href="../cathen/04067a.htm">Clouet</a>, <a href="../cathen/06663b.htm">Mabuse</a>, and Scorel; of <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer</a>, <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a>, and Cranach; of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and of Correggio, while in applied arts there was immense industry and great development. The German metal-workers and goldsmiths prepared church vessels innumerable; Cellini and Caradosso produced ornaments for church <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01356d.htm">screen</a> and the woodwork for King's College Chapel, Cambridge, typified the ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/15698b.htm">wood-carving</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">windows</a> at King's College Chapel, in other <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and in great churches show ecclesiastical art.

<p>The fall of Florence marked the close of the period of great <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> in that city while the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestry</a> executed for <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> at Fontainebleau, for Lewis at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> done by <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> for the Medici Chapel, all point out the enhanced power of the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanistic</a> movement and the destruction of that devotion to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had been so marked a feature of the earlier centuries.

<p>The epoch of the Late Renaissance, extending from 1500 to 1600, and overlapping that of the Full Renaissance was still, however, distinguished by a considerable amount of earnest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a> in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="../cathen/09419b.htm">Luini</a>, <a href="../cathen/06047a.htm">Gaudenzio Ferrari</a>, <a href="../cathen/13478c.htm">Andra del Sarto</a>, <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Sodoma</a>, Bronzino, and <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Peruzzi</a>, are strongly religious, full of right feeling, and almost exclusively done for churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">guild</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, but outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the connexion between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> is by no means so apparent.

<p>Spanish supremacy in Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had been destroyed, and 1576 was marked by the rapid decline of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The Iberian goldsmiths and iron-workers still certainly produced their famous grilles, jewels, <a href="../cathen/10577c.htm">morses</a>, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, and crucifixes while in <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">needle-work</a> the finest workers of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> were elaborating some of the most perfect examples of <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">church vestments</a> that have ever been produced. In bronze, the smiths of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> were casting superb church candelabra, and some of the weavers in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were producing <a href="../cathen/14449b.htm">tapestry</a> decoration for churches; but the greater part of the Gobelin, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and Mortlake tapestry-weaving; was for domestic use, the greatest architects were working on domestic architecture, the potters on domestic pottery, and the printers and engravers upon work which cannot be termed religious.

<p>The names of certain men stand out, however, as representing <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of deep personal <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religion</a>, who brought their own devotion to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to bear upon the work they executed. Such men were <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>, <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02391a.htm">Behaims</a>, but the period of that supreme hold which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had retained upon the art of the world, which she had initiated, developed, and encouraged, was passing away, never more to appear in its full fruition.

<p>Some reference should be made to the system under which during this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> many of the great decorative schemes of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> were executed. The encouragement which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> took various forms. It was permissible for an influential or a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to have allotted to it a small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the large <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or town church, and the decoration of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was left to the care of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> whose name it received. In some cases, these <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were built onto the church, and in such instances an architect, a builder, a decorator, and an artist were all employed. and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gladly gave permission for such additions to the church structure, in order that the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> might have a meeting-place and an opportunity to make an <a href="../cathen/05421b.htm">endowment</a> for perpetual Masses for its deceased members.

<p>In cases where a new structure was not erected, a portion of the existing church was enclosed as a private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, perhaps in memory of a father, a mother, or some children and a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of repute was called in to devise a scheme of decoration for its walls, in which would be introduced the figures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to whom the deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a>, or scenes from the lives of such <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; in many cases life-size figures of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were represented with their hands upon the kneeling figures of the donors of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. There was no thought of an anachronism; it was considered perfectly right that representations of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had died but a few weeks or months before should be introduced into the scenes in which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of early <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> were depicted. It then became the ambition of later members to add to the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> as means allowed. The walls having been decorated, an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> would be <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by another artist, while perhaps, following him, yet a third would ornament the front of the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, or craftsmen would be called in to supply objects used in the sacred service or <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> and books for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In this way these little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> became shrines for artistic work, the productions of many hands, representing the desires of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to place the best of work at the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to act <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">dutifully</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> itself, and to make a suitable offering in recompense for crimes committed.

<p>Another course sometimes adopted was to call in two <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, rivals in their profession, to decorate different walls of a church, or the two sides of an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a>, or again, when some great addition was made to the fabric on account of an important event, such as the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of a local saint, or a marked interposition of Providence on behalf of the town, different influential <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the place would undertake to be responsible for portions of the building, each calling in his own favourite <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and in this way the work would be completed. Or it might be that an order desired to decorate a church <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, and the commission would be given to some notable artist, who perhaps was unable to complete the task or who died before its completion. In such cases, others were called in to complete it, and in this way the fabric was beautified by various successive hands.

<p>The number of definitely personal commissions which the sixteenth-century artist had was small, as even in the instances where a patron ordered a picture, it was generally an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, or else the decoration of some building belonging to the <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">trade guild</a> to which he was attached, and this <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">trade guild</a> being nearly always a religious association, the commission came under the category of religious work.

<p>It is all this which marks the great distinction between <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> and craftsmanship previous to the sixteenth century and after it. In the period from the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to about 1260 in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and about 1460 in Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the dominant art is architecture, chiefly employed in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the arts of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and carving were only applied subordinated for its enrichment. During the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance period</a> the imitative arts, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and the various art-crafts began to develop and detach themselves, to exist and strive after perfection on their own account, and while architecture still held an important position, it was no longer dominant; the arts which supplied the interior decoration of the building, and the objects needed in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ceased to be considered as subordinate, but were taking each its own high position under the guidance of workers of supreme genius.

<p>From the period, however, of the Full Renaissance the great dignity of architecture begins to diminish, especially as regards ecclesiastical buildings, and architects devoted themselves almost exclusively to domestic and civic work. Architecture ceased to be personal, democratic, local, and became professional and more or less uniform throughout the whole of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, while it suffered severely because the designing of detail became in many, cases the work of others than the executant workmen. The same sort of difficulty was befalling the pictorial art and the arts of the craftsmen. The personal element was no longer the main strength of an art. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> side of the work was almost non-existent, and the crafts suffered by reason of the fact that the commercial element had entered into art and the adornment of the house, the palace, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> was considered of far greater importance than the adornment of the church, and the sacrifice of the life of the worker for the greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h2>Post-Renaissance period</h2>

<p>There are certain political explanations of this great change between the art of the sixteenth and the art of the seventeenth century. There were several forces at work which were hostile or indifferent to artistic development, such as the religious, dynastic and commercial <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the difficulties of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and constitutional problems, while the grouping together of small towns into larger provinces and countries was doing away with the rivalry of the craftsmen in the smaller places, and permitting a spirit of greater uniformity in style to spread throughout a large section of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Add to all these colonial expansion, huge enterprise, and great commercial prosperity, constantly broken into by ravaging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and the causes for the decay of that spirit of religious activity in art characterizing earlier periods are apparent. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were, in the seventeenth century, almost the only two countries in which any close connection between art and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was kept up. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was troubled with the religious question, and struggling with great constitutional problems, while it had given itself over to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and such art as it was producing was the great <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> triumph of Sir Christopher Wren in the rebuilding of the churches of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and the various sections of craftsmanship concerned with the adornment of the house and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> there were still some great goldsmiths at work, and some even greater workers in wrought iron, preparing the <em>rejas</em> for the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, while pictorial art was at its very highest in that country, and its masterpieces, with the exception of those of the very greatest artist of all, <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a>, were devoted to subjects suggested by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Yet there had been no country in which the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> had been so trammelled by traditional restrictions as in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The very manner in which each saint was to be represented, the method in which his or her clothing was to be <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, and the colouring which was to be applied to each garment, had been a matter of stern <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. It had needed the profound genius of a <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a> to break through the traditional rules, and to open for his successors, and especially for <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>, a period of greater freedom. Commencing with such <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> as Pantoja della Cruz and <a href="../cathen/03345a.htm">Vicente Carducci</a>, the great Spanish School had produced the Ribaltas and <a href="../cathen/13031b.htm">Ribera</a>, and then the majestic <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the only great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to follow <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a> was <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>, but there were many whose works were marked by distinction, excellence, and beauty, especially <a href="../cathen/15770a.htm">Zurburan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08132a.htm">Iriarte</a>, Juan de Valdes, <a href="../cathen/03250d.htm">Alonso Cano</a>, and Orrente. The seventeenth century was, in various countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, one of the important periods of artistic production, and although the Italian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the Realists, and the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of the Second Revival were men whose productions at the present time are out of favour, yet they deserve more than a passing notice, while contemporary with them are others who rank among the veritable giants of the artistic craft. The late Italian artists, the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a>, <a href="../cathen/10569b.htm">Caravaggio</a>, Sasso Ferrato, <a href="../cathen/05093b.htm">Carlo Dolci</a>, <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, <a href="../cathen/06564b.htm">Luca Giordano</a>, <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">Carlo Maratta</a>, <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, <a href="../cathen/13183c.htm">Salvator Rosa</a>, and others, show in their work melodramatic style, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of magnificent colouring, and intense shades. The draughtsmanship of these artists should cause their works to be more highly esteemed than they are at present, for they certainly represent an important epoch in the art history of the world, and one which must never be overlooked. Many of their works were altar-pieces <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for churches, or were intended for church decoration, but at the same time they were greatly influenced by the Humanistic movement, and by the eager desire to represent the stories of classical writers in pictorial effect. The commercial prosperity of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, at a time when other nations were lacking in material wealth, was one of the reasons for the existence of a veritable crowd of artists just at this time. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had ceased to commission pictures in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and very seldom were stories, either from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, or from the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, represented by this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of artists.

<p>In dealing with the arts and crafts of the eighteenth century, a new and destructive factor which had arisen must be taken into consideration. "The genius of handicraft," as has been well said, "passes now into invention," and the commencement of a system now appears that was eventually to strike at the very roots of the manner in which supreme works of genius had been produced in the preceding centuries. It must also be noticed that, in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> especially, the artistic centre of gravity had shifted from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and to a lesser extent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> took but a very small share in the artistic development of the eighteenth century, instead of, as in preceding periods being the great centres of development themselves. The triumph of the home, however, in contradistinction to that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was now complete, and portraiture, whether concerning itself with the great decorative single figures or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> groups of Reynolds and Gainsborough, or with the productions of the leading miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, <a href="../cathen/04421a.htm">Cosway</a>, Engleheart, Plimer, Smart, Hone, Wood, and their numerous followers, was exclusively applied to the multiplication of portraits of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were able to afford to employ the artist, and who desired to possess and distribute to others such delightful representations as would adorn the home and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Ecclesiastical art, or art for the decoration of the church, had hardly any existence.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> towards the middle of the nineteenth century a new movement having in it some of the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> of earlier Italian art began to arise. The foremost artist of this new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was Sir Edward Burne-Jones. In the wonderful succession of poetic visions which he presented, marked by a play of fancy, a fertility of inventiveness, tender witchery of inspiration exquisite colour, and grace and harmony of line and grouping, he was able to develop the spirit of religious emotion to a far fuller extent than he himself had intended, and to vivify the old legends of primitive times which had formed part of his inheritance from Celtic ancestors. His appearance on the horizon of art was to a great extent coincident with the blossoming forth of what has been termed the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> in religion, a growing desire for a deeper and fuller devotion, an eager determination to return to earlier and purer lines of thought in religion to set <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> free from the regulations of statecraft, and to rise from the dreary monotony of a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Genevan</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to something approaching closer to the fiery enthusiasm and the sumptuous ceremonial of the passionate <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of earlier days. The progress of this movement within the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a> led to a considerable number of accessions to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of its origin it worked a complete revolution. Once more there arose the determination that the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be beautiful, and once again art with all the various crafts closely connected therewith entered into the service of religion, very much in the manner they had done in preceding centuries. Tapestry-workers, under the influence of William Morris and Burne-Jones, were set to work to prepare panels of glowing colour for the decoration of churches. The <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, under the influence of these craftsmen, sought out old designs, originated new schemes of colour, and worked hard to discover old secrets of technic. The earlier <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> were studied, and all over the country <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> set to work to make vestments and to execute <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">needlework</a> of rare distinction and great beauty. A revival took place in the art of the metal-worker and in that of the stone-mason. Many fine wrought- iron grilles were made, and the claim of the artist to prepare the design and to superintend the carrying out of its execution was once more considered and gladly entertained. Quite apart from the religious aspect of the movement there was in this Oxford revival the origin of the effort towards greater refinement, greater beauty, and more attention to handicraft which, commencing in the middle of the nineteenth century, has by no means reached its culmination till the early years of the twentieth.

<p>One of the first and most important of the movements which aimed to break away from the artistic traditions of the eighteenth century took place in the early part of the nineteenth century in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and was led by <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>. The Academy of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, at the time that he entered it, was under the direction of F&uuml;ger, a talented miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, but a follower of the pseudo classical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of David, and a firm believer in the tenets of these opinions, too conservative to vary from them in the least degree. <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> felt that he was among commonplace <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, that every noble thought was suppressed within the academy, and that <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> had been diverted and corrupted until nothing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> remained in it. The differences between him and his followers and their fellow-students were so serious that the upholders of <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> and their leader were expelled from the academy. Leaving <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, reaching it in 1810, and remaining there for fifty-nine years. Here he was joined by such men as <a href="../cathen/15322a.htm">Veit</a>, Cornelius, <a href="../cathen/13518a.htm">Schadow</a>, with others of less importance &mdash; together they formed a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which was known as the Nazarites, or the Church-Romantic <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. They built up a severe revival on simple nature and the serious art of the Umbrian and Bolognese <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, and although for a long time they laboured under great difficulties yet, after a while, they were able to exert considerable influence, and their success led to memorable revivals throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, as were several of his friends. He was a man of high purity of motive, of deep insight, and abounding <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, a very saintly <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and a perfect treasury of art and poetry, insomuch that his influence helped very largely to purify the art of his time. The secessions from the conservative line adopted by the Royal Academy in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> late in the nineteenth century were not marked by the particular element of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a> distinguishing <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>, but were the result of a similar determination to return to nature, and understand the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the open air, with not only a strict adherence to realism in choice and treatment of subject, but also the subordination of colour to tone gradation. These secessions in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were, however, very much the result of the movement in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> which had preceded them, and which was connected with the name of <a href="../cathen/10310b.htm">Millet</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries there are arising some signs that the old practice of enlisting the services of art for the purposes of religion may be developed, but the signals of an approaching movement are not very strong as yet, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has a good deal to learn with regard to decoration, to design, and to craftsmanship from the earlier periods of its history. Foremost among the signs of the new spirit must be placed the erection of the <a href="../cathen/15599a.htm">Westminster Cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, one of the most perfect buildings in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, erected after the truest and most careful study of the past and with every desire to give full play to the spirit of the present and to the original talent of its designer, while avoiding anything that could be called a slavish copying of the past. This building affords an example of the revived use of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> properly applied, in method following the work of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and planned by a great artist, Bentley. It affords the most perfect scheme of interior decoration that could well be conceived. In other countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the signs of progress are not quite so clear, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which fostered and encouraged art from its very birth has so many glorious examples in its midst of the great achievements of profound genius that it can only be a matter of time before its ancient use of the fine arts is revived. A close study of the past would enable the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to once more set about the task of employing the craftsmen of the world to produce their finest work in the domain of ecclesiastical art.
