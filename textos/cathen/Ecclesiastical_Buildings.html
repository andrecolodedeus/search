<h1>Ecclesiastical Buildings</h1>  

<p>This term comprehends all constructions erected for the celebration of liturgical acts, whatever be the name given to them:-- church, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, oratory, basilica, etc. The subject will be treated under the following heads: <blockquote> I. History <br>II. Division <br>III. Erection <br>IV. Repair and Maintenance <br>V. Consecration and Blessing <br>VI. Immunity <br>VII. Church Fabric </blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>In the earliest days of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, there were no buildings specially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Eucharistic worship; the assemblies for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> service were held in private houses (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs46">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs5">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs15">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>; <a href="../bible/col004.htm#vrs15">Colossians 4:15</a>; <a href="../bible/phm001.htm#vrs2">Philemon 2</a>). The assemblies which the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> held in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> or even in hired halls, were assemblies for instruction or for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs12">Acts 5:12-13</a>; <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs1">17:1-2</a>; <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs9">19:9</a>). At the end of the second century and even later, during the period of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, assemblies for <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a> were still held in private houses. During this epoch, however, we begin to hear of the <em>domus ecclesiae</em> (the house of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), an edifice used for all the services of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, in which one apartment was specially set apart for Divine worship. At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> this apartment took on a special importance. During the third century the other parts of the building were detached from it and the <em>domus ecclesiae</em> became the <em>Domus Dei</em> (the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) known also as the <em>Dominicum</em> or the <em>kyriakon oikon</em> (Duchesne, Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien, 399-400, Paris, 1902; Wieland, Mensa und Confessio: Studien uber den Altar der altchristlichen Liturgie, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1906, I, 27-35, 68-73). All such churches were situated in towns, and the inhabitants of the rural districts came thither on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>, in order to assist at the Eucharistic Sacrifice; in large cities, like <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and Carthage, there are several churches, but they did not constitute separate <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (Duchesne, 400; Wieland, 73-76). They depended upon the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, in which was established the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (<em>sedes</em>), or the chair (<em>cathedra</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There were, however, since the second century, outside the cities, mortuary churches attached to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries. Here were celebrated the funeral rites, also the anniversary commemorations of the departed, but not the ordinary offices of Divine worship. Sanctuaries were also erected over the sepulchres of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and popular devotion brought thither a large concourse of people, not only for the celebration of the anniversary, but at other times as well. The necessity of providing accommodation for these gatherings, as well as the desire to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, led to the construction of buildings, sometimes large and richly adorned. These churches multiplied when the people began to accord to any <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> whatever, to a piece of cloth stained with his blood, to a phial of oil drawn from the lamp that burned constantly before his sepulchre, etc., the veneration at first given only to his burial place. These were the churches of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">"relics"</a>. They prevailed finally to such an extent that today every church must have <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in each of its altars (Duchesne, 402-403). It is almost universally recognized at the present day that only on exceptional occasions did the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> serve for ordinary worship even during the times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. They were used solely for funeral services and for the celebration of the festivals of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (Wieland, 81-100).

<p>That churches existed in rural districts as early as the fourth century is undeniable. Priests went thither periodically to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In the fifth century, however, on account of the increase in the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to station resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in such districts. This was the origin of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, which were established by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the most populous districts, the <em>vici</em>, and were known as <em>ecclesiae rusticanae, parochitanae, diocesanae, diocesis, parochia, ecclesiae baptismates,</em> because in these churches only could the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> be administered; they were also termed <em>tituli majores</em> to distinguish them from the private churches, or <em>tituli minores</em> (Imbart de la Tour, Les paroisses rurales du IVe au XIIe si&egrave;cle, Paris, 1900). In addition to these churches of the <em>vici</em>, the owners of the <em>villae</em> or great estates founded churches for their own use and for that of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> connected with their establishments. Such churches could not be used for Divine worship without the consent of the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was wont to exact from the proprietor a renunciation of all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of possession. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, however, was not long able to resist the proprietors, who from the seventh and eighth centuries retained the proprietary right over the churches they had built. These were called <em>oratoria, basilicae, martyria</em>, or <em>tituli minores</em>, and were in no respect <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, because in them <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> could not be administered; moreover, on certain solemn days, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to assist at Mass in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. Neither did these churches receive any <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period, however, such private churches gradually became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-churches. Some authors contend that from that epoch all churches became the private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms of the eleventh and twelfth centuries brought this condition of things to all end. The <a href="../cathen/09017a.htm">Second Lateran Council</a> (1139) commanded all <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to resign to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the churches in their possession. (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Coll. Conc." XXI, 529-532; Stutz, "Geschichte des kirchl. Benefizialwesens", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1895, I; Hinschius, "System des kath. Kirchenrechts", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1878, II, 262-269, 277- 281; Imbart de la Tour, op. cit.) Even within the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, there were established at various times, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> which did not enjoy the prerogatives of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, and were more or less dependent upon the latter (<a href="../cathen/13528a.htm">Von Scherer</a>, Handbuch des Kirehenrechtes, Graz, 1898, II, 627). In addition to churches specially intended for the use of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, others known as <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> were erected in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; they acquired a greater importance when the majority of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, still more when the exclusive privileges of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches suffered diminution. Such <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> were also common in beneficent and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> corporations (guilds) which were also religious confraternities, had sometimes their own special <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> (Viollet, Histoire des institutions politiques de la <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Paris, 1903, III,143-176).


<h2 id="section2">Division</h2>

<p>Ecclesiastical buildings are usually divided into four classes: <ul> <li>churches properly so called, <li>public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, <li>private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, and <li>semi-public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>. </ul> This division was confirmed by the Congregation of Rites, 23 January, 1899 (Decreta authent. Congreg sacr. Rit. no. 4007, Rome, 1900). Churches are edifices set apart in perpetuity for the public exercise of Divine worship; such are <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, collegiate and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, and lastly the conventual churches of regulars, properly so called. Public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> are buildings of less importance, definitely given over to Divine worship, and accessible to the public, whether the entrance itself be upon the public road or upon a passage-way leading to the latter. A private oratory is one established in favour of a particular <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or even of a single individual. Finally, a semi-public oratory is established for the benefit of a number of people; such is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, a congregation of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, etc. With these may be classed the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Erection</h2>

<p>Basilicas, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, collegiate churches, and private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, may be erected only with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; other churches or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Nevertheless the authorization given by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> involves, unless there is a stipulation to the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to construct a monastic church. On the other hand all provincial superiors of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders have the power to open semi-public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> for the use of their religious, and that without the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, "Decet Romanum", 3 May, 1575, granted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and applicable likewise to all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in virtue of the communication of privileges. Cf. Vermeersch, De religiosis institutis et personis, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1902, I, 316). For the erection of a private oratory, even by religious, the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> (C.S.R., 10 November, 1906; "Canoniste Contemporain", 1907, XXX, 109, 110). Congregations of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> may have but one semi-public or public oratory, with the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If they wish to erect several for the convenience of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or of the infirm, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to obtain the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy see</a> (C.S.R. 8 March, 1879, Decreta, no. 3484).

<p>The erection of every church on the other hand must be justified by its necessity, or by its use; it must not in any way prejudice the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of churches already established (c. iii, "De ecclesiis aedificandis vel reparandis", X, III, xlviii, c. i, ii, iv, "De novi operis nuntiatione", X, V, xxxii; Friedberg, "Corpus juris canonici", Leipzig, 1881, II, 652, 843). The church should also be sufficiently endowed (c. viii, "De consecratione ecclesiae vel altaris", X, III, xl; Friedberg, II, 634). Practically it is sufficient that the church have at its disposal, e.g. through the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the revenues <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the maintenance of the building, the celebration of Divine service, and the support of its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> (Bargilliat, Praelect. jur. can., Paris, 1900, II, 331). In certain countries the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> is also needed. The building of a church cannot be begun before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his delegate has approved of the site, placed a cross there, and blessed the first stone (Pontificate Romanum, Pars II, De benedict. et imposit. prim. lapid. pro eccl. aedif.). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can also reserve to himself the approval of the plans and conditions according to which the church is to be constructed (Wernz, Jus Decretal., Rome, 1901, III, 432, 433. To avoid useless expenditure and to prevent the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from improvidently contracting <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>, the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> enacted as a preliminary condition for the construction of a church, the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in writing (Acta et decreta Concilii Plenarii Baltimorensis, III, no. 279). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has power to apply to the construction of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> a part of the revenues, which in certain countries are annually assigned to him from the revenues of the different churches; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> being the <em>ecclesia matrix</em>, or mother-church of all those of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, its construction is a work which interests the whole diocese (the Eighth Provincial, the Second Plenary, Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 1855 and 1866, and the Second <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Australia, 1869; "Collectio Lacensis", Freiburg, 1875, III, 162, 429, 1078; also 200-202, 242, 1085). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can even levy a <em>subsidium charitativum</em> for this purpose, i.e a moderate tax upon the revenues of the churches and on those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who enjoy <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. In default of other resources the usual means is to collect money for this object, or to ask the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions.
<h2 id="section4">Repair and maintenance</h2>

<p>Originally the repairs of the churches were incumbent upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as administrators of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods. When, according to ancient custom, these goods were divided into four parts, one part was assigned to the <em>Fabrica</em> (see below) i.e. to the church building and its maintenance. Later, each church had its own patrimony, and one part of its goods was assigned to its maintenance. This charge was also incumbent upon the holders of the goods and revenues of the church. The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> sanctioned this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, at the same time they urged the people to help defray the expenses (c. i. iv, "De ecclesii aedificandis", X, II, xlviii; Friedberg, II. 652, 653). Finally the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, De ref. c. vii) located more exactly the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to repair the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches (Permander, Die kirchliche Baulast, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1890, 1-18). By present <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation the repairs of the church belong especially to the fabric, which must use the funds appropriated for that special purpose and if need be, its superfluous revenues (c. vi, "De ecclesiis aedificandis"; Friedberg, II, 654; Council of Trent, Sess. XXI, De ref. c. vii). These resources failing, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who possess the right of patronage over the church intervene if they wish to preserve their privileges (Canones et decreta conc. Trid. ed. Schulte and Richter, Leipzig, 1853, 121, no. 4). This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> rests also on all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who enjoy part of the revenues of the church the tithe-owners, whether <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, seculars or regulars, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and all those who enjoy a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> from the church. The parishioners themselves are bound to provide for the maintenance of the church, each according to his means. In practice collections should be made for this object. These same principles apply to <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>; in case the revenues of the church are insufficient, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the chapter, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the inhabitants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> ought to contribute for its support (S&auml;gm&uuml;ller, Lehrbuch des kathol. Kirchenrechts, Freiburg, 1900-04, 798, 799). For the support of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, as for its erection, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can ask from his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a special aid or <em>subsidium charitativum.</em> Wherever these rules have been abrogated by other customs, the latter should be followed. In case of fire, the insurance might cover the damage. Hence special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> may make <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> the insurance of churches (Acta et Decreta Concilii Baltimorensis III, no. 283). Chapels or churches belonging to congregations of regulars or to particular establishments, ought to be maintained at the expense of these establishments. It sometimes happens that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> contributes to the support of churches, as well as to their construction. In reality such co-operation is often only a restitution of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> or revenues misappropriated by the civil government.
<h2 id="section5">Consecration and blessing</h2>

<p>Churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> cannot be used for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions, without having first been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> or at least blessed. Cathedral and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches ought to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. However, in case of necessity they may be provisionally blessed (Rit. Rom., tit. viii, c. xxvii). Public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> and other churches may be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, though this is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. They ought, however, to receive a solemn benediction. Private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, on the other hand, cannot receive such benediction; it is fitting, however, that the <em>benedictio loci</em> be given to them (op. cit. c. vi.) Some hold that semi-public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> which in exterior appearance resemble churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and which are definitely destined for Divine worship, may be solemnly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (C.S.R., 7 August, 1875, 5 June, 1899; Decreta, nos. 3364, 4025). The custom of dedicating churches to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is very ancient. In his Ecclesiastical History (X, iii, iv) <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> describes the dedication, in 314, of the church erected by Constantine at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, at which time, however, there was no special rite for that purpose. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the sixth century, the dedication consisted in the public celebration of a solemn Mass, and if it was a church which was to contain <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, these latter were brought to the church in solemn procession. It seems that at the same period, there existed a special rite of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. In their brief outlines, the present ceremonies are derived from a combination of the rites used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a combination which had already been made before the beginning of the eighth century (Duchesne, op. cit., 403-418). The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or dedication is performed according to the rite prescribed in the "Pontificale Romanum" (De ecclesiae dedicatione seu consecratione) by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> delegated for that office by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The essential rite of this dedication consisting in the anointing of the twelve crosses upon the walls with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a>, and the recitation of the words <em>Sanctificetur</em>, etc. (Wernz, III, 437). It is not permitted to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a church without at the same time consecrating the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, or, if this has already been consecrating another fixed altar. If all the altars have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to ask the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Without the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, however, of an altar, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church will not be invalid (C.S.R., 12 August, 1854; 3 March, 1866, 19 May 1896, Decreta, nos. 3025, 3142, 3907). When the public authorities forbid the performance of the prescribed ceremonies outside the church, a <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">pontifical indult</a> must be obtained, except in case of necessity; such ceremonies must then be performed in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> or some other dependency of the church (C.S.R., 22 February, 1888; Decreta, no. 3687). A church built of wood cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (C. S. R., 11 April, 1902; "Canoniste contemporain", 1902, XXV, 495).

<p>The vigil of the day of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is a fast-day of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and for those who have asked for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church (C.S.R., 29 July, 1780, 12 September, 1840; Decreta nos. 2519, 2821; Reply of the Holy Office, 14 December, 1898; "Acta Sanctae Sedis", 1898-99, XXXI, 533). The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the dedication must be celebrated every year on the anniversary day of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The Bishop may, if he chooses, fix another day; but this he should on the very day on which he consecrates the church (C.S.R. 19 September, 1665, 23 May, 1834; Decreta, nos 1321, 2719). While this feast should be celebrated by all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> connected with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> church, the anniversary of the dedication of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> ought to be celebrated by all the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and by all the regulars all the episcopal city (C.S.R., 12 September 1884, 9 July, 1895; Decreta, nos. 3622, 3863). If the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the anniversary is unknown, the most probable date should be chosen until such time as the date can be determined with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (C.S.R. 14 June, 1608, 13 March, 1649; Decreta, nos. 261, 920). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may fix a day if the right one be completely unknown (C.S.R., 18 August, 1629; 3 March, 1674; 27 November, 1706; 12 March, 1735; Decreta, nos. 511, 1498, 2174, 2313). The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> sometimes permits the celebration of the anniversary of the dedication of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> and of all the churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on the same day. All the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are then bound to celebrate this festival (C.S.R., 29 November, 1878; Decreta, no. 3469).

<p>The solemn benediction is a rite inferior to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. It is performed by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> delegated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for that purpose (Rit. Rom. tit. viii, c. xxvii). It consists in the sprinkling of the upper and lower parts of the walls of the church with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which accompany this action (Wernz, III, 437). A new <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or benediction of a church or oratory ought to be made in the case of execration or <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a>, that is to say, when the building has lost its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or benediction. This is the case when eccleciastical buildings have been definitely put to profane uses (Council of Trent, Sess. XXI, De ref. c. vii.); similarly, in accordance with modern discipline, if almost the entire church or a large portion of the walls have been destroyed or renewed (C.S.R., 14 September, 1875; Decreta, no. 3372). Successive alterations and repairs, however, even though considerable, as also the renewal of the roof, are not to be regarded as execration (C.S.R., 31 August, 1872, Decreta, no. 3269). The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> affects the entire building, but especially the walls; the removal, therefore, of the anointed crosses or even of the interior plastering (intonaco) of the walls, does not necessitate a new <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (C.S.R., 13 July, 1883; 19 May, 1896; Decreta, nos. 3584, 3907). The same principles are applicable to churches that have been solemnly blessed this benediction affects the walls rather than the pavement of the church. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was that the benediction attached itself to the pavement the mere destruction of the walls would not have the effect of producing the execration of the church (Wernz, III, 441 442).

<p>Widely different from <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> is the <em>pollutio</em> of a church. This is a defilement of the church which prevents the celebration of the Divine offices until the church has been reconciled or purified. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound to interrupt the celebration of Mass, if the church in which he is celebrating is polluted before he has commenced the Canon (Missale Romanum, De defectibus in celebratione missarum occurrentibus, X). A church is polluted by every kind of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> even by a case of capital punishment, or by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> committed in the church, but the wound must have been inflicted within the church and, according to some authors, death must have taken place there. A church is likewise polluted when a considerable quantity of blood has been wilfully and culpably spilled within it, or when the <em>effusio seminis humani</em> has taken place, wilfully and in a seriously culpable manner (c. iv, x, De consecratione ecclesiae, X, III xi; Fridberg, II, 634- 635). In like manner also a church is polluted by the burial within it of an infidel, or of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> (<em>excommunicatus vitandus</em>) (c. vii, loc. cit.; Bargilliat, II, 343-344), not, however, by the burial of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and perhaps not by that of unbaptized infants born of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (C.S.R., 23 April, 1875; Decreta, no 3344).

<p>It is important to remark that the reconciliation must be performed only when the pollution has been public. A church that has been solemnly blessed can be reconciled by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, according to the ceremonies prescribed in the "Rituale Romanum" (tit. viii, c. xxviii). Many authors, however, affirm that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be delegated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the Congregation of Rites has given a decision to the same effect (8 July, 1904, Canoniste Contemporain, 1904, XXIV, 683). A church that has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> can be reconciled only by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> delegated by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and with water blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This privilege as has been granted to exempt religious (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, "Religionis", 3 February, 1514). The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> grants to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in missionary countries the power to delegate to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to reconcile a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> church, but the water employed must be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or, in case of necessity, by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (Bargilliat, II, 345, Putzer-Konings, "Commentarium in facultates apostolicas", New York, 1898, 215-217). Sometimes the reconciliation is performed <em>ad cautelam</em> as for instance when a church has been occupied by soldiers for two days (C.S.R., 27 February, 1847; Decreta, no. 2908). This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> does not refer to <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> which have received only the <em>benedictio loci.</em>
<h2 id="section6">Immunity</h2>

<p>Churches enjoy by ecclesiastical law the same immunity from secular burdens and as all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>. The state may not burden them with taxes (Council of Trent, Sess XXV, De ref. c. xx; Syllabus nos. 30, 32). In many states the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> recognize this privilege for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>. Such immunity is very ancient and dates from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors of the fourth century (O. Grashof, in Archiv f. kath Kirchenrecht, 1876, XXXV, 3 sqq., 193 sqq.) On the other hand, every irreverence within a church or public oratory is a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, such as the theft of an article even though it does not belong to the church or an article that has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (Decretum Gratiani P. II, c xvii, q. 4, c. xxi; Friedberg, I, 820). Such also are the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh (Lehmkuhl, Theologia moralis, Freiburg, 1898, I, 238, 239). The reverence due to the holy place forbids all profane actions. Therefore, the following actions are forbidden in a church: trials not falling within <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, trading; games, plays and secular songs; banquets; the making of a dwelling either above or below the church; etc. In this category may be included the introduction of draperies and banners which have not been blessed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Wernz, III, 446). It belongs to the office of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to specify what actions are forbidden in the churches, and to settle the controversies which may arise. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is also empowered to provide for the maintenance of order and may also commit this care to a delegate, for instance, to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In connection with this see RIGHT OF ASYLUM.
<h2 id="section7">The church fabric</h2>

<p>By the term <em>Fabrica ecclesiae</em> are to be understood not only the goods belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but also the administrators of these goods. Ever since the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> have been allowed to participate in this administration, and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not reprove their intervention (Sess. XXII, De ref. ch. ix). The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> also intervenes in order to regulate the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. The following are examples of how the fabrics are organized in certain countries.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> recognized fabrics of the churches, and entrusted the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches to five or nine elected members, to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and mayor. These formed the <em>conseil de fabrique.</em> The elective members holding office for six years and eligible for re-election, were chosen by the council itself. These vestrymen had in hand the administration of the temporal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the church elected from amongst their number a <em>bureau des Marguilliers</em> composed of three members and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, charged with the ordinary administration and execution of the decisions of the council. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the right of control over the management of the vestrymen. His <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> as well as that of the State was required for their most important undertakings. The communal authority could control the budgets and the accounts when the fabric asked the former for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> funds to defray the expenses of Divine worship, and for the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings.

<p>The French Municipal Law of 5 May, 1884, ordered that the budgets and accounts should be submitted to the communal council, and freed the commune from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of making up a deficit in the resources of the fabric for ordinary expenses of divine worship. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the power to organize the fabric of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> himself, but the administration of its goods was still under the control of the Government (De Champeaux, "Recueil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de droit civil eccel&eacute;siastique francais", Paris, 1860; Bargilliat, II, 110-159). This organization, modified, however, by the Constitution of 1831 and by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 4 March, 1874, still continues in force in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (De Corswarem, Des Fabriques d'&eacute;glises, Hasselt, 1904). The Law of 11 December 1905, suppressed the fabrics in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and replaced them by <em>associations cultuelles</em> which <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> forbade by his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, "Gravissimo officii" (10 August, 1906; Canoniste contemporain, 1906, XXIX, 572). This law by handing over to seven, fifteen, or twenty-five <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, without making any mention whatever of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control, increases the State's power of interference in the administration of these associations and give it full power to suppress them (Jenouvrier, Expose de la situation l&eacute;gale de l'&Eacute;glise de France, d'apres la loi du 11 d&eacute;cembre, 1905, Paris, 1906).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> the fabrics of the churches were organized by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 20 June, 1875, enacted during the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>.</em> In each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (<em>Kirchegemeinde</em>) <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods are administered by a body of churchwardens termed <em>Kirchenvorstand</em> under the control of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> board or <em>Gemeindevertretung.</em> This assembly is not, however, everywhere <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. The members of these assemblies are elected by all the male parishioners, who are of age and have resided for at least one year in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, pay the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tax, and have their own homes, conduct a business concern, or fill a public office. All electors over thirty years of age are eligible for office with the exception of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and the servants or employees of the church. No man can hold office in both these assemblies. The <em>Kirchenvorstand</em> is composed of members varying in number from four to ten, according to the total number of the population. Since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 21 May, 1886 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<em>Pfarrer</em>) is the president ex officio of this assembly, except in those places in which, before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1875, the presidency was given to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. This assembly administers the temporal concerns of the church. The <em>Gemeindevertretung</em> includes three times as many members as the <em>Kirchenvorstand.</em> It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that they should give their consent to the most important acts of the administration of the <em>Kirchenvorstand</em>: the alienations, the acquisitions, the loans, the most important works, taxes (<em>Kirchensteuer</em>), etc, and approve the budgets and accounts. The president of the <em>Kirchenvorsiand</em>, or his delegate, assists as a consultor at their meetings. All mandates remain in force for six years. The State and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority exercise supreme control over the most important actions of these fabrics (Archiv f&uuml;r katholisches Kirchenrecht, 1875 XXXIV, 167, 1876, XXXV, 161, 1886, LVI, 196, 1887, LVII, 153.

<p>In the French-speaking portion of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a> (<a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>) fabrics also exist. Their organization still corresponds, in its main outlines, to the ancient organization of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> before the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution of 1789</a>, as described by Jousse in his "Trait&eacute; du gouvernement spirituel et temporel des paroisses" (Paris, 1769). There is, first of all, the Parochial Assembly (Vestry) comprising all the <em>Francs-tenanciers</em> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; no alienation, no loan, can be concluded without their intervention. In case a subscription is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> they raise it by assessment. The churchwardens actually in office, called <em>marguilliers du Banc</em>, and the former churchwardens, must pay the ordinary expenses. This is the <em>bureau ordinaire</em> of the ancient French law. Finally, ordinary matters of administration are attended to by a commission composed of three members chosen for three years by the old and the newly elected churchwardens. Each one of the three churchwardens is in charge for a year i.e., he performs the functions of treasurer and must render an account to the assembly. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is president of the fabric and represents the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. All the important accounts must be approved of by the latter (Beaudry, "Code des cur&eacute;s, marguilliers, et paroissiens", <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 1870, Gignac, "Compendium juris canonici ad usum cleri Canadensis," Quebec, 1901; Migneault, "Droit paroissial", <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1891)

<p>For other countries, see S&auml;gm&uuml;ller, "Lehrbuch des katholischen Kirchenrechts" (782, 795). In English speaking countries fabrics properly so called do not exist. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> is given in trust to reliable men. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves regulate the administration of these goods. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the trustees are the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and sometimes other reliable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (First and Second Synod of Westminster, XIV, 4, and VIII, 1-21; Provincial Synod of Maynooth, 1875, tit. xxix, nos. 270-277; Collectio Lacensis, III, 926, 980). In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is often given in trust to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in cases where the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are civilly incorporated, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> forms the corporation sole; sometimes the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belongs to a board of trustees composed of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church, and two lay trustees (<a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, The Law of the Church, London, 1906, 310-317). In accordance with the Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (nos. 284-287) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> judges whether or not it is wise to establish councilmen or a board of trustees; he fixes their number and the mode of their election. They are subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The relations of the State to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, especially in English-speaking countries, will be treated in the articles: <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL PROPERTY</a>; INCORPORATION; <a href="../cathen/15071b.htm">TRUSTEE SYSTEM</a>.
