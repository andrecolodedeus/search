<h1>Ecclesiastical Canons</h1>  

<p>Ecclesiastical Canons are certain rules or norms of conduct or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The name is derived from the Greek <em>kanon</em>, the instrument used by architects and artificers for making straight lines. Some writers think that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> preferred the word <em>canon</em> to <em>law</em>, as the latter had a harsh meaning for the faithful in the times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The early Fathers use canon as equivalent to the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, or for some formula expressing a binding <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (Iren&aelig;us, Adv. H&aelig;r., I, ix; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, De Pr&aelig;scr., 13). <a href="../cathen/16010a.htm">Bickell</a> declares that for the first three hundred years, canon is scarcely ever found for a separate and special <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; rather does it designate the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> in general. He appeals to the fact that the plural form of the word is seldom used in the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">earliest Christian writers</a> (Bickell, Geschichte des Kirchenrechts, I, 8). With the fourth century began the use of canon for a disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, owing to its employment in this sense by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">First Council of Nice</a> (325). The Cassinese editors of <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a> (s.v. Canones) say that in the first ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> many disciplinary regulations were not required, and hence it was scarcely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to discriminate decrees into dogmatic and disciplinary, as the faithful classed both under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to observe the general <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. From the fourth century onward, canon signified almost universally a disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of a council or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>. The word decretum during the same period, though signifying in general an authoritative statute or decision, began to be limited more and more to dogmatic matters, while canon when used in opposition to it was restricted to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of discipline. That this usage, however, was not invariable is evident from Gratian's use of "Decretum" to signify his collection of canons and decrees. From the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> exclusive, the regulations concerning discipline issued by assemblies of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received the name of canons.

<p>With the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in the sixteenth century began the departure from this ancient usage. This council used the word <em>canon</em> for short, dogmatic definitions with an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> attached to them. On the other hand it gave the name of <em>decrees</em> to its disciplinary regulations. The example set by <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> was followed by the Council of the Vatican. The usage of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> seems to bring canon nearer to the signification it bore before the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a>, when it referred rather to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than to discipline. The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a decision by Church authority seems to be also the root-meaning of the expressions "Canon of Scripture", "Canon of the Mass", "Canon of Saints", although for the last term <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Ducange</a> (s.v. Canonizare) suggests a somewhat different origin. As <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations began to multiply, it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to gather them into <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>, which generally received the title of "Collection of Canons" (see <a href="../cathen/03281a.htm">COLLECTIONS OF ANCIENT CANONS</a>). In these, civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are often added to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regulations. For such collections the Greeks used the term <em>Nomocanones</em>. The Latins have no special name for them, though Capitularies (q.v.), e.g. of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, is sometimes referred to as a somewhat parallel usage in the West.

<p>As to the authority of ecclesiastical canons, it is evident a distinction must be made when speaking of canons of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and canons of discipline, for the former are irreversible, the latter are not. Similarly, it is plain that canons containing a precept already binding by reason of Divine or <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, cannot be on the same footing as those that are of mere <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin. In general, the "Corpus Juris Canonici" declares (cap. 1. de Const.) that canonical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are binding on all; likewise (cap. Quum scimus) that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are the guardians of the canons and must see to their observance. When there is question of canons in the ordinary <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sense (namely, that which obtained before the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>), as they refer principally to matters of discipline, it must be borne in mind that they are neither immutable nor irreformable. The subject-matter of such canons depends not only on circumstances of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, places, and times, but also on considerations of expediency or temporary necessity. A change in any of the causes which brought about the framing of the canons, will make a change in their binding-force, for disciplinary regulations are almost necessarily mutable. In like manner when there is question of the binding force of a canon, it is important to determine whether it was issued by a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as imposing an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, or whether it was framed solely for restricted regions or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In the latter case its binding-force is as restricted as its scope.

<p>It must be borne in mind that the object which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always had in view in <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> her canons has been the guidance and preservation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and in the best methods of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. Although, therefore, such canons contain elements of positive human law, yet ultimately they are founded on the Divine or <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. As such they cannot be entirely abrogated by contrary custom (Ferraris, loc. cit.), though their rigour may be mitigated by certain circumstances, on the ceasing of which, the pristine rigour of the canon would be again binding. When they are entirely of human law, they may, of course, be completely abrogated, not only by legislation on the part of the proper authorities, but also by legitimate custom. The study of the sacred canons is especially enjoined on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Perhaps most of the regulations refer directly to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> will find in them the surest guidance for their own conduct and for the fruitful exercise of their ministry in directing the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The neglect of the prescriptions of the sacred canons has always been the source of corruption in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and perhaps the chief reason for the loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by nations as well as by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.
