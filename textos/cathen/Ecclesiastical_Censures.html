<h1>Ecclesiastical Censures</h1>  

<p>Medicinal and spiritual punishments imposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, delinquent, and <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, by which he is deprived, either wholly of in part, of the use of certain spiritual goods, until he recover from his <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>.
<h2>History and development</h2>

<p>The name and general nature of this punishment date from the Roman Republic. With the ancient Romans, in the year A.U.C. 311, we find established the office of public censor (<em>censores</em>), whose functions were the keeping of a register (<em>census</em>) of all Roman citizens and their proper classification, e.g., senators, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, etc. Furthermore their functions were the disciplinary control of manners and mores, in which their powers were absolute, both in sumptuary matters and in the degradation of any citizen from his proper class, for reasons affecting the moral or material welfare of the State. This punishment was called censure (<em>censura</em>). As the Romans were jealous in preserving the dignity of their citizenship, so also was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> solicitous for the purity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of her membership, i.e., the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In the early church the faithful in communion with her were inscribed in a certain register; these names were read in public gatherings, and from this list were excluded those who were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, i.e., put out of the communion. These registers were called <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> or canons, and contained the names of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, both living and dead. The Canon of the Mass still preserves traces of this ancient discipline.

<p><a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> was then the generic term for all coercive remedies used against delinquent members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and there were as many kinds of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> as there were grades of communion in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, either for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, or for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Thus some of the grades of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were the <em>expiatores</em> and <em>p&aelig;nitentes</em>, again subdivided into <em>consistentes, substrati, audientes</em>, and <em>flentes</em> or <em>lugentes.</em> Then also, as now, some goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were common to all its members e.g., <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, presence at the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. Other goods again were proper to the various grades of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Whoever was deprived of one or all of these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, came under the general designation of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, i.e., one placed outside the communion to which his grade in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> entitled him, either wholly or in part. (Bernardi, Com. in Jus Eccl., II, pt. II, diss. 3, cap. 5.) In earlier <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents therefore, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and similar terms did not always mean censure, or a certain species of censure, but sometimes meant censure, sometimes <em>poena</em>, as explained below, and very often penance. In the later Roman legal terminology (Codex Theod. I tit.I, 7 de off. <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. provinc.) we find the word censure used in the general sense of punishment. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the early ages, used this term to designate all her punishments, whether these were public penances, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunications</a>, or, in the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> or degradation. In her ancient penal legislation, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, like the Roman State, looked on punishment as consisting, not so much as the infliction of positive suffering, as in the mere deprivation of certain goods, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, or privileges; these in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were spiritual good and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, such as participation with the faithful in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in the general communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and honours of their office.

<p>Some centuries later, however, in the period of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, we note a great advance in legal <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in the courts, a distinction was made between internal and external forum, the former referring to matters of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the latter to the external government and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>. The different kinds and the nature of punishments were also more clearly defined by commentators, judges, and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of law. In this way, from the beginning of the thirteenth century, although not expressly so stated in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, the term censure became the equivalent of a certain class of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties, i.e., <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who in 1200 (cap. 13 X De judicious, II, 1) had used the term for punishment in general, at a later date (1214), answering a query as to the meaning of ecclesiastical censure in pontifical documents, expressly distinguished (cap. 20, X De verb, signif. V, 40) censure from any other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalty (respondemus quod per eam non solum interdicti, sed suspensionis et excommunicationis sententia valet inteligi), thereby authentically declaring that by ecclesiastical censure were meant the penalties of <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Furthermore, in accordance with the internal nature of these three penalties, glossators and commentators, and in their wake later canonists introduced and maintained the distinction, still universally recognized, between medicinal or remedial punishments (censures) and vindictive punishments. The primary scope of the former is the correction or reformation of the delinquent; this being properly accomplished, they cease. Vindictive punishments (<em>poen&aelig; vindicativ&aelig;</em>), while not absolutely excluding the correction of the delinquent, are primarily intended to repair violated <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or to restore the social order of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by the infliction of positive suffering. Such are corporal and pecuniary punishments, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and seclusion for life in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, deprivation of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>, also the deposition and degradation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> as well as their <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> for a definite period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. (<a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">Suspension</a> <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em>, e.g., for one or for three years, is a censure, according to <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, Th. Mor. VII, n. 314.) Confession penances are vindictive punishments, their chief purpose being, not reformation, but reparation, and satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The irregularity arising from a crime is not a censure, nor is it a vindictive punishment; in fact, it is not a punishment at all, properly speaking, but rather a <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a>, an inability to support the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sacred ministry, which forbids the reception of orders, and the exercise of those received.



<p>The matter of censures was seriously affected by the Constitution "Ad vitanda" of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> in 1418. Prior to this constitution, all censured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, known to be such by the public, were to be avoided (<em>vitandi</em>) and could not be communicated with <em>in divinis</em> or <em>in humanis</em>, i.e., in religious or in civil intercourse. A censure, being a penal withdraw of the right of participating in certain spiritual goods of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, was of course something relative, that is, it affected the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> thus enjoined and also the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who participated with him in the use of these goods. In this way the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> or other spiritual services could not be accepted from a <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspended</a> cleric. But, by virtue of the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, only those censured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were in the future to be considered and treated as <em>vitandi</em> who were expressly and specifically by name declared to be such by a judicial sentence. The S. Cong. Inquis. (9 Jan. 1884) declared this formality unnecessary in the case of <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicates</a> vitandi for the reason of sacrilegious <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Nor is the validity of the denunciation restricted to the locality where it takes place (Lehmkuhl, II, n.884). On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> expressly declared that this relaxation was not in favor of the censured party, so that the <em>tolerati</em> really gained no direct privilege, but was only in favor of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who could henceforth communicate with tolerated <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicates</a>, and, as far as the censure was in question, could deal with them as non-censured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>--all this on account of the grave changes in social conditions. (See <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>.) In 1869 <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> modified seriously the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in the matter of censures by his Constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis Moderatoni"</a> which abrogated many <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> censures of the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, changed others (thus reducing their number), and made a new list of <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> censures <em>lat&aelig; senti&aelig;</em>.
<h2>Nature of the penalties</h2>

<p>If every human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to protect itself by laying down conditions according to which men can be and remain members and enjoy the benefits of such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, it is easily conceivable how <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> such a right is for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded on moral principles, aiming at higher ends, and dispensing spiritual benefits, in view of the eternal welfare of her members. The power to enforce these conditions the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receives from Christ. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make disciplinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to govern her subjects. That right would be meaningless if she had no way of enforcing the observance of her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself gave her this power when He gave to Peter the power to govern the whole Church (John xxi, 15 sqq.). He meant as much when he said of the offending brother that "if he will not hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> let him be to thee as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs17">Matthew 18:17</a>). Moreover, from her very origin, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has used this right to enforce her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as may be seen from the action of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> against the incest Corinthian (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 5:1 sqq.</a>) and against Hymeneus and Alexander (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs20">1 Timothy 1:20</a>). The end for which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is striving is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In dealing with delinquent members therefore she seeks principally their correction; she wishes the reformation of the sinner, his return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This primary effect of her penalties is often followed by other results, such as the example given to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and, ultimately, the preservation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. On the Divine principle, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not desire the death of the sinner, but that he should be converted from his ways and live (<a href="../bible/eze018.htm#vrs23">Ezekiel 18:23</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always inclined to the infliction of censures, as medicinal or remedial in their nature and effects, rather than to vindictive punishments, which she uses only when there is little or no hope for the sinner himself.

<p>It follows, then, that the primary and proximate end of censures is to overcome <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> or willful stubbornness in order to bring back the guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to a better sense of his spiritual condition; the secondary and remote end is to furnish an example of punishment in order that other evil-doers may be deterred. Contumacy is an act of stubborn or abstinent disobedience to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; but it must imply contempt of authority; i.e., it must not only be directed against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but must also, generally express contempt for the punishment or the censure attached to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. (Lehmkuhl, Cas. Consc., Freiburg, 1903, no. 984.) Ignorance of the threatened punishment or grave fear would, therefore, generally excuse a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from incurring censure; under such circumstances there can be no question of real <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> implies abstinent persistence in crime, in order to become liable to these punishments a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> must not only be guilty of crime, but must also persist in his criminal course after having been duly warned and admonished. This warning (<em>monitio canonica</em>), which must precede the punishment, can emanate either from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself or from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior or judge. Contumacy can therefore occur in one of two ways: first, when the delinquent does not heed the warning of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior or judge, addressed to him personally and individually; second, when he violates a law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and of the censure attached, in the latter case the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself being a standing warning to all (<em>Lex interpellat pro homine</em>).

<p>Censures, being a privation of grave spiritual benefit, are inflicted on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> internally and externally grave, and <em>in genere suo</em>, i.e., in its own kind, or that contemplated by the censure, perfect and complete. There must be a just proportion between the crime and the penalty. Being medicinal, the punishment of a censure consists, not in depriving the delinquent of the spiritual goods themselves, but only of the use of the spiritual goods, and this, not perpetually, but for an indeterminant time, i.e., until he repents, in other words, until the patient is convalescent from his spiritual illness. Hence <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, being by far the gravest of censures, is never inflicted for a certain definite time; on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, under certain conditions, may be inflicted for a definite time. The real punishment of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures consists in the privation of the use of certain spiritual good or benefits. These spiritual goods are those which are within the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or those which depend on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, sacred functions, jurisdictions, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> and offices. Censures, however, do not deprive of grace, nor of the private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the faithful; for, even if censured, the eternal communion of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> still remains by virtue of the indelible character imprinted by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Thus, to distinguish the various effects of the three censures: <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> may be inflicted on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and excludes from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, prohibits also the use of all spiritual goods in which the faithful participate as members of the visible body whose visible head is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">Suspension</a> is for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> only, leaves them participating in the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but directly prohibits them from the active use of sacred things, i.e., as <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> (<em>qua ministri</em>), and deprives them of some or all of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, e.g., <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the hearing of confessions, the holding of office, etc. <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">Interdict</a> prohibits the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, either <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, from the passive use of some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods, as far as these are sacred things (<em>res sacr&aelig;</em>) or as far as the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are participants, e.g., certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>, etc.
<h2>Division</h2>

<p>Besides the particular division of censures into <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, there are several general divisions of censures. First censures <em>a jure</em> and <em>ab homine.</em> Censures <em>a jure</em> (by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>) are those inflicted by a permanent edict of the lawgiver, i.e., which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself attaches to a crime. We must distinguish here between a law, i.e., an enactment having, of itself, permanent and perpetual binding force, and a mere command or precept, usually temporal in <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and lapsing with the death of the superior by whom it was given. Censures <em>a jure</em>, therefore, are annexed either to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, such as decrees of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, or are inflicted by general law, e.g., by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for their particular diocese or territory, usually in provincial or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Censures <em>ab homine</em> (by man) are those which are passed by the sentence, command, or particular precept of the judge, e.g., by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as contradistinguished from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> described above. They are usually owing to particular and transient circumstances, and are intended to last only as long as such circumstances exist. The censure <em>ab homine</em> may be in the form of a general order, command, or precept, binding on all subjects (<em>per sententiam generalum</em>), or it may be only by a particular command or precept for an individual case, e.g., in a trial where the delinquent is found guilty and censured, or as a particular precept to stop a particular delinquency.

<p>Another division of censures is important and peculiar to the penal legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A censure <em>a jure</em> or <em>ab homine</em> may be either (1) <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> or (2) <em>ferend&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em>.

<p>(1) Censures <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> (of sentence pronounced) are incurred <em>ipso facto</em> by the commission of the crime; in other words, the delinquent incurs the penalty in the very act of breaking the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and the censure binds the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the delinquent immediately, without the process of a trial, or the formality of a judicial sentence. The law itself inflicts the penalty in the moment when the violation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is complete. This kind of penalty is especially effective in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose subjects are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to obey her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. If the crime be secret, the censure is also secret, but it is binding before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; if the crime be public the censure is also public; but if the secret censure thus incurred is to be made public, then a judicial examination of the crime is had, and the formal declaration (declaratory sentence) is made that the delinquent has incurred the censure.

<p>(2) Censures <em>ferend&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> (of sentence awaiting pronouncement) are so attached to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> or to the precept that the delinquent does not incur the penalty until, after a legal process, it is formally imposed by a judicial or condemnatory sentence. Whether a censure be <em>lat&aelig;</em> or <em>ferend&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> is ascertained from the terms in which it is couched. The expressions most commonly used in the censure <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> are: <em>ipso factor, ipsa jure, eo ipso sit excommunicatus</em>, etc. If however, the expressions are of the future, and imply judicial intervention, the censure is <em>ferend&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> e.g., <em>excommunicetur, suspenditur</em>, etc. In <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> cases, the sentence is presumed to be <em>ferend&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em>, because in penal matters the more benign interpretation is to be followed. Moreover, before the infliction of the latter kind of censures, three warnings (<em>monitiones</em>) are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, or one peremptory warning, except when both the crime and the <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> of the delinquent are <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> and therefore sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.

<p>Censures are again divided into reserved and non-reserved censures. As <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be reserved, so also may censures, reservation in this case being limited to limitation or negation of an inferior's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to absolve from the censure, and the retention of this power by his superior. (See Reservation).
<h2>Requirements for censures</h2>

<p>For the infliction of censures, either <em>a jure</em> or <em>ab homine</em>, are required: (1) Jurisdiction in the legislature or the judge; (2) sufficient cause; (3) correct method of procedure. As to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, since censures belong to the <em>forum externum</em> or external government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it necessarily follows that for their infliction, either by law or by judge, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or power to act in this forum is required. Sufficient cause moreover, must be had for the infliction of a censure. A censure, as a sanction of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is an accessory to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; therefore a substantial defect in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> or unreasonableness, modifying the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, nullifies also the censure attached to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. This sufficient cause for a censure may be lacking in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, either because in its formulation the legal order was not observed, or because the fault considered in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was not sufficiently grave to justify the penalty of ecclesiastical censure. The penalty must be in proportion to the crime. If in the legislative act the legal order was observed, but the proportion of punishment to crime was lacking, i.e., if the offense did not justify the extreme penalty attached to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, then as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has two parts, it is sustained in the first part, i.e., the precept, but not in the second, i.e., the penalty or censure (Suarez Disp. IV, sect. VI, no. 10). In <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, however, both law and penalty are presumably valid. As to the correct method of procedure, a sentence of censure may be void if any substantial rule of procedure is not observed, e.g., the warnings in a censure inflicted <em>ab homine.</em> The censure is valid, however, if there be any objective proportion between the gravity of the penalty and the gravity of the fault, even if the sentence have some accidental defect, e.g., a censure inflicted through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who, however, is a transgressor, or if some other accidental rule of procedure has not been observed. A question arises concerning censures invalid <em>in foro interno</em> or according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but valid <em>in foro externo</em> or according to presumption of law. For instance, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is convicted of a crime <em>in foro externo</em> to which a censure is attached, but in his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> he knows himself to be innocent. What are the effects of a censure thus inflicted? Having been found guilty <em>in foro externo</em>, the censure has valid effects in that forum and must be observed externally, to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and for good discipline. All acts of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> <em>in foro externo</em> of such a censured party might be declared invalid. But in foro interno he would possess <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and, should there be no danger of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, he could act as though uncensured without incurring the penalty of violating the censure, e.g., irregularity. A censure may also be inflicted conditionally; if the condition is fulfilled, the censure is valid.

<p>Can censures be inflicted as vindictive penalties, i.e., not primarily as remedial measures, but rather to avenge a crime? This is a graver question, and canonists has sought to solve it by an interpretation of certain texts of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, chiefly from "Decretum" of Gratian (<em>Eos qui rapiunt, Raptores.</em>-- Caus. XXXVI, Q. 2, c. 1, 2, <em>Si quis episcopus</em>, Caus. XXVII, Q. 1, c. 6. etc.). These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> however, contemplate the earlier discipline of censures, when the name was applied to punishments in general, without any specific signification. It is evident, therefore, that the solution must now be sought in positive law. In the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, no express decision of the question is to be found, although the species of penalties are there more accurately distinguished. In later law, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, (Sess. XXV, c. iii, De ref.) most wisely warns <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that the sword of censures is to be used only with sobriety and with great circumspection. Censures, being essentially a deprivation of the use of spiritual goods or benefits, are to be inflicted medicinally, and should therefore be lifted as soon as the delinquent recedes from his <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>. We have seen above that St. Alphonsus and other authors after him, hold that secondarily, a censure mat have punitive and deterrent motive, and from that point of view, may be inflicted for a given time. This is generally speaking, for while it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> can never be thus inflicted as a vindictive punishment, <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> can be inflicted, rarely and for a short period, as vindictive penalties by positive law. The reason of this is that <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> do not, like <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, cast the delinquent out from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, neither do they deprive him absolutely of all spiritual goods; they may, therefore, for grave reasons take on the nature of vindictive penalties. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> when their effect is the privation of some temporal right, e.g., when a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspended</a> from his office or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>; for whenever censures deprive primarily of the use of temporal goods, they are rather punishments properly so called than censures, whose primary character is the deprivation of the use of spiritual goods (Suarez, op. cit., disp. IV, sect. V, 29-30).
<h2>Subject of censures, active and passive</h2>

<p>As regards the active subject of censures, i.e., who can inflict them, it must be stated that censures belong to the external government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They can therefore be inflicted only by those who have proper <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external government of the church (<em>forum externum</em>). Censures <em>a jure</em>, i.e., incorporated into <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> binding <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, in whole or in part, can be passed by him who has the power to thus legislate. Thus the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> can inflict such censures on the whole world, the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a> in their own spheres, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> within his own diocese, the chapter or <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> during the vacancy of a see (<em>sede vacante</em>), regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> having external <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, also chapters of regulars over their own subjects. Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, abbesses, and secular judges, however, have no such power. Censures <em>ab homine</em>, or inflicted by an <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a>, whether his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> be ordinary or delegated, can be inflicted to enforce a certain law, or to prevent certain evils. <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicars-general</a> and delegated judges not having legislative power cannot inflict censures <em>a jure</em>, but only <em>ab homine</em>, in order to assert and protect their power, e.g., to enforce the execution of a judicial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. In respect to the passive subject of censures, i.e., who can be censured, it must be noted that censures. being spiritual punishments, can only be inflicted on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Moreover, being punishments, they can only be inflicted on the subjects of the superior inflicting the censure; such subjection may arise from domicile, quasi-domicile, or by reason of the crime committed (<em>ratione delicti</em>). Pilgrims violating a particular law are not subject to censure, but if they transgress the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> with a censure <em>ferend&aelig; sentienti&aelig;</em> attached, the latter can be inflicted on them by the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not subject to censures <em>a jure</em> (except <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>) unless in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> express mention be made of them. Kings and sovereigns cannot be censured by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nor can communities or chapters be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by them. However, a community can suffer <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> and <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>, only in that case, it would not be a censure, properly speaking, but rather a penal privation; ceasing to be a member of the community, one would cease to undergo the penalty.
<h2>Absolution from censures</h2>

<p>All canonists agree in this, that a censure once incurred can only be taken away by <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Although censures are medicinal punishments and are destined to overcome <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>, they do not cease at once upon repentance. As the sentence was a judicial act, so there is required a judicial <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, lawfully given when there is amendment. Not even the death of the censured party, if <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a>, would remove the censure, because even in this case there would still remain some of the effects of the censure, e.g., the privation of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. The only case in which formal <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> would not be required is when a censure is inflicted with a <em>conditio resolutiva</em>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> pending the performance of a certain act. When <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> or <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> are inflicted as vindictive punishments, not being censures properly so called, they may cease, not by <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, but by lapse of the time for which they are inflicted. Censures themselves, i.e., not yet incurred, cease by the abrogation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to which they were annexed, by revocation, or (usually) by the death of the superior, if issued <em>ab homine</em> as a particular precept.

<p><a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">Absolution</a>, which is the loosing or relaxation of the penalty by competent authority, is an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and a <em>res favorabilis</em> in censures, and hence cannot be denied to a penitent censured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It can be given in two ways: (1) In the <em>forum internum</em>, that is, for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and hidden censure. This can be given by any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; can be given in confession or outside of confession, in what is called the forum of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> (<em>forum conscienti&aelig;</em>). In either case, however, the formula used is that of the sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> referring to censures. (2) In the <em>forum externum</em> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> can only be given by those vested with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> judicial power, i.e., by the one who inflicted the censure, his successor, delegate, or his superior, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The formula used here is either the solemn one or the shorter formula, as the occasion demands; both are found in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>. <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">Absolution</a> can be given either absolutely or conditionally, i.e., depending on the fulfillment of some condition for its validity. It is also given <em>ad cautelam</em> (for safety's sake) in all <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, and Apostolic privileges, lest the effects of the concession be impeded by some hidden censure. Lastly, we have <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> <em>ad reincidentiam</em>; this takes effect immediately, but if the penitent, within a certain time, does not do something prescribed, he at once occurs, <em>ipso facto</em>, a censure of the same kind as that from which he had just been absolved. He who takes away the censure can impose the <em>reincidentia.</em> Today there is only a <em>reincidentia ab homine</em>, i.e., although sometimes called for and provided for in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. it must be applied <em>ab homine</em>, i.e., by the absolving <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (Lega, lib II, vol. III, nos. 130-31).

<p>In regard to the question of the minister of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, or who can absolve from censures, we have the general principle: "only he can loose who can bind" (<em>illius est solvere cujus est ligare</em>); in other words, only those can absolve who have the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is either ordinary or delegated. In case of censures <em>ab homine</em>, by particular sentence or by way of precept, also in the case of reserved censure <em>a jure</em>, only he who inflicted the censure or his successor, superior, or delegate can absolve. Hence a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> can absolve from the censures passed by the ordinary power of the late <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having succeeded to the power held by that late <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. In regard to the power of the superior, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as universal superior can always remove the censures inflicted by his inferiors, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, etc. An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, not being the absolute superior of his suffragans, but only in certain things, can remove censures imposed by his suffragans only when on visitation or in case of appeal. When, however, the superior absolves from the censure imposed by an inferior, he must in all cases notify the inferior and must demand that the delinquent give him full satisfaction. The extent of the power of a delegated judge to absolve must be clearly stated in his letters.

<p>When censures are passed <em>a jure communi</em> or <em>ab homine</em> by a general sentence, if these censures be not reserved, any approved confessor having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to absolve from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may absolve from them both in the external and the internal forum, the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the one forum being valid in the other, except when the censure has been carried to the <em>forum contentiosum</em>, i.e., is already in litigation before a court, in which case the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of the internal forum would not hold for the external. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> not approved or not having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> cannot absolve from censures, even if not reserved, except in danger of death. Lastly, when censures are reserved <em>a jure</em> no one can absolve except the one to whom to whom they are reserved, or his superior, successor, or delegate. Censures which are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> are either simply reserved or reserved in a special manner. In relation to the former, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. vi, De ref.) formulated the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> according to which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or one delegated by him can absolve, <em>in foro conscienti&aelig;</em> and in his own diocese, his subjects from these censures when the crime is occult and not <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, or when it has not been brought before a judicial tribunal. By <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are here meant also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> having <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory, vicars capitular, and others having episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; not, however, vicars general in virtue of their general commission, nor regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The subjects for whom these faculties may be used are those who live in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> diocese, or outsiders who come to confession in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, these being his subjects in view of the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> to be imparted. Such <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, however, cannot be given <em>in foro externo</em>, but is limited to the <em>forum conscienti&aelig;</em>, i.e., to the domain of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. If censures are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> in a special manner, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by his ordinary power cannot absolve, except in case of necessity. Special concessions for these cases are, however, given to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for a certain time, or for the life of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or for a certain number of cases. Censures which are reserved by pontifical law to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or ordinaries can be absolved by all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, vicars capitular and vicars-general, in any forum, and even in <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> cases. At the point of death (<em>in articulo mortis</em>), any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even if not approved, can absolve from all censures, but also all <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from them as governed by the provision of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitution (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 1869), <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis Moderationi"</a>. For serious changes in the method of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> (in cases of necessity) from <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> censures, owing to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of S. Cong. Inquis. (23 June, 1886) and later interpretations, see Tanquery, Synop. Th. Mor., III (II), 1907, pp. 321-24, and Gury-Ferr&egrave;res, Th.

<p>These conditions affect both the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who absolves and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> absolved. The <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is invalid if obtained by force or if extorted by grave, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> fear. Furthermore the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> would be invalid if the principal, moving cause be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, e.g., if the judge absolves precisely because alleges that he has already made satisfaction, when in reality he has not done so. The conditions to be absolved are generally expressed in the above-mentioned formula, <em>injunctis de more injungendis</em>, i.e., enjoining those things which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> requires. These are: (1) satisfaction to the offended party; (2) that the delinquent repair the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> according to the prudent judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or confessor and remove the <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasion of sin</a>, if there be any; (3) that, in the case of one absolved from censures specially reserved, he promise (<em>in foro externo</em>, on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>) to abide by the further direction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the matter (<em>stare mandatis ecclesi&aelig;</em>); (4) sometimes also, in graver crimes, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is required not to perpetrate them again; (5) that apart from the penance imposed in confession, the absolved <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receive and perform some other salutary penance as a satisfaction for this fault.
