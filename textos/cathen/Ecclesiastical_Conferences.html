<h1>Ecclesiastical Conferences</h1>  

<p>Ecclesiastical Conferences are meetings of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> for the purpose of discussing, in general, matters pertaining to their state of life, and, in particular, questions of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>.
<h2>Historical sketch</h2>

<p>The origin of ecclesiastical conferences has been sought in the assemblies of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>. As early as the third century, it was customary for these <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> to meet together to discuss matters relating to asceticism and the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life. When, later on, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were instituted, somewhat similar conferences were held among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. There seems, however, to be little in common between these monastic assemblies and the pastoral collations, or conferences, of the present time. The more direct source of the latter are the quasi-synodal meetings of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by various decrees of the ninth century. such as those of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> and Riculfus of Sion in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and the Capitularies of Charlemagne. Such assemblies were looked upon as supplements of, or pendants to, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and were intended principally for those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who found it difficult or impossible to assist at the regular <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. These <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were ordered to meet at a convenient place, in their various districts, under the presidency of the dean or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and their assemblies were called <em>Calend&oelig;</em>, because held on the first of the month. Other terms applied to such meetings were <em>consistories</em>, <em>sessions</em>, and <em>capitular conferences</em>. We find them prescribed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the Council of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> in 1131 and the Council of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1237. In the sixteenth century ecclesiastical conferences received a new impulse. <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a> prescribed them in his constitution (1540) for members of his order. Later, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> commanded that all houses of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have conferences twice a week on matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The main promoter of conferences among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> was <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who treated of them specifically in a synod at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1565, when introducing the reforms decreed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">Cardinal Borromeo</a> ordered that the conferences be held monthly, and that they be presided over by the vicar forane or dean. Gradually the custom spread through the various ecclesiastical provinces; and at present these meetings are held in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in plenary or provincial councils or <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Many of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have strongly urged on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of various countries the necessity and utility of the conferences, and <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a> commanded that when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> make their visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<em>ad limina</em>) they should report, among other things. whether <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> conferences are held in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. There seems, however, to be no general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which makes these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> meetings <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>.
<h2>Diocesan laws</h2>

<p>The holding of conferences has been introduced among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of all English-speaking countries, in virtue of ordinances <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at councils or <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866) declares: "As an adjunct to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and in lieu of their frequent celebration, let there be <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which will preserve the rudiments of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> in the minds of all, promote a healthy and uniform method for the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, dispel <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> inertia, and afford an opportunity for eliminating abuses. We greatly desire that these conferences he held four times a year by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who can conveniently meet; and in the rural districts at least twice a year. All who have care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, whether seculars or regulars, should attend them" (No. 68). The Third Plenary Council (1884) treats in title v of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and devotes the fifth chapter to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> collations or conferences. It quotes the words of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a>: "Some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are at first admirable directors of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> later lose their previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, by neglect of study. so that from being masters of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> they can scarcely be called <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in it, since they retain only confused and imperfect recollections of its first rudiments." In consequence, the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> renew the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the previous plenary council as to the frequency of these conferences, and, after declaring them <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all having care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, they add: "Nor can those confessors consider themselves exempt, who, although not attached to any certain church, hear the confessions of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> or of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> in public churches. Those who frequently absent themselves without legitimate cause and the permission of the Ordinary should be punished." The Second Council of Quebec (1854) declares (Decr. 14): "Ecclesiastical conferences will promote <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for study. Every one knows how useful they are for increasing mutual charity among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and for instructing and confirming them in sacred <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. We desire all, especially those who have pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to assist at them faithfully according to the method and time prescribed by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>."

<p>For <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">National Synod</a> of Thurles (1850) <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>: "Since what the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> have learnt as scholars can easily be forgotten, unless it be called to memory by use, we recommend that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences be held according to custom, at least four times a year. In them such questions as pertain to practice should be especially treated." We find the following <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (No. 6) emanating from the First provincial Council of Australia (1844): "We ordain that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences be held in every deanery, at least three times a year, where it can be done without great inconvenience." In 1852, the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster (Decr. 24) made the following rules for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>: "We desire most earnestly that conferences on moral questions or on other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> or <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters be held in all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> at certain stated times. According to locality, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> determine, whether the whole <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> should convene together under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> presidency, or whether a number of conferences be held in different vicariates under the presidency of the vicars forane. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to attend these conferences and take part in them is binding on all <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and on all regulars (saving their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>) having <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>." As to regulars, we have the following provision in the "Romanos Pontifices" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>: "We declare that all rectors of missions, by reason of their office, must assist at the conferences of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; and we also <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and command that there be present likewise the vicars and other regulars, having the usual missionary faculties, who reside in small communities." It will be noticed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> simply "declares" religious rectors to have an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to assist at the conferences, for this is in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>; but as he derogates from that law in prescribing that other regular missionaries who dwell in small communities should also attend, he uses the words <em><a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and command</em>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gives the reason why he makes the distinction between regulars inhabiting large and small communities; the former have their own domestic conferences, the latter either do not have them at all, or they are not likely to be fruitful.
<h2>Subject matter of conferences</h2>

<p>Among the questions to be answered by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the visit <em>ad limina</em> is: "Are conferences held on <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> or cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and also on sacred rites? How often are they held, who attend them, and what results are obtained from them?" It is evident from this question that the main matters to be discussed are those pertaining to <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and liturgy. If these be given proper consideration, other subjects may also be considered, such as questions of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, canon law, Biblical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and similar things. According to the prescriptions of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, a case of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> should be proposed at these meetings and each one present should, in turn, be asked his opinion. After this, the presiding officer makes a short summary and gives his decision. The Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> wishes that questions be proposed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on matters of discipline and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are to be solved in writing by all who attend: but only two, chosen by lot, are to read their solutions. Questions on <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, canon law, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">sacred liturgy</a> are to be answered by those who have been appointed for the purpose at the previous conference. The <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (1817), obliges all who cannot attend the meeting to send their solution of the cases in writing. The First Council of Quebec made a similar <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. The Council of Westminster requires that all who come should be prepared to respond to questions concerning the matters proposed. The <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of the English, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> colonies (1854) prescribes that the dean send the solution of the cases either to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or to some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom the latter shall designate. Among the decrees of the First Council of Westminster (No. 24) is the following: "The conferences are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to send to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the solutions of the cases or the conclusions reached, to be examined and corrected by him. Each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is to determine the method to be observed and the matters to be considered in the conferences." <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> wrote as follows to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1856: "Let conferences, especially concerning <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and sacred rites, be instituted by you, which all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should attend and bring in writing the explanation of a question proposed by you. They should also discuss, for such length of time as you may prescribe, matters connected with <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and ritual practice, after some one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> has delivered a discourse on the particular <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> order."
