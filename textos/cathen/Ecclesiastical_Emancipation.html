<h1>Ecclesiastical Emancipation</h1>  

<p>In ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> emancipation was a process of law by which a slave released from the control of his master, or a son liberated from the authority of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (<em>patria potestas</em>), was declared legally independent. The earliest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> employment of this process was in the freeing of slaves. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unable to change at once the sad condition of the slave, was able, however, to gradually substitute for slavery the milder institution of serfdom, and to introduce in place of the elaborate formalities of the <em>emancipatio</em> the simpler form of the <em>manumissio in ecclesi&acirc;</em> (Cod., De his, qui in ecclesi&acirc; manumittuntur, i, 13), in which a simple statement to that effect by the master before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the congregation sufficed. The emancipation of a slave was especially <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as a preliminary to his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> [c. i (Synod of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, 1078, can, viii), X, De filiis presbyterorum ordinandis vel non, I, xvii; c. iii (Fourth Synod of Toledo, 633, can. lxxiv), X, De servis non ordinandis et eorum manumissione, I, xviii]. Similarly, the entrance of a son into a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, i.e. the taking of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, or the <em>professio religiosa</em>, carries with it in canon law his emancipation from the legal authority (<em>patria potestas</em>) of the father. No positive law, however, can be quoted on this point, nor does modern civil legislation recognize this consequence of <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. The canon law recognizes another, purely imitative form of emancipation. This was the release of a pupil of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a <em>domicellaris</em>, from subjection to the authority of the <em>scholasticus</em>, or head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. This emancipation took place with certain well-defined ceremonies, known in the old German <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as <em>Kappengang</em>.

<p>The term <em>emancipation</em> is also applied to the release of a secular ecclesiastic from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, or of a regular from obedience and submission to his former superior, because of election to the episcopate. The petition requesting release from the former condition of service or submission, which the collegiate electoral body, or the newly elected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, must present to the former superior, is called <em>postulatio simplex</em>, in contradistinction to the <em>postulatio sollemnis</em>, or petition to be laid before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in case some <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a> prevents the elected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from assuming the episcopal office. The document granting the dismissal from the former relations is called <em>litter&oelig; dimissori&oelig;</em> or <em>emancipatori&oelig;</em>. It is not customary to use the term <em>emancipation</em> for that form of dismissal by which a church is released from <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from subordination to his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or order from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for the purpose of placing such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or body under the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority next higher in rank, or under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself. This act is universally known as exemption.
