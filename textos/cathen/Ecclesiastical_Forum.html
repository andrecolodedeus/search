<h1>Ecclesiastical Forum</h1>  

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ has judicial and coercive power is plain from the constitution given to it by its Divine Founder. (See <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS</a>.) This judicial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is expressed by the word <em>Forum</em>, the Latin designation for a place containing a tribunal of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, she possesses within herself all the powers <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to direct her members to the end for which she was instituted and she has a correlative right to be obeyed by those subject to her. This right is called <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and it is the source of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> action that is not derived from the power of Sacred orders. It is this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which is the foundation of ecclesiastical law, both externally and internally binding, and from Apostolic times it has been put into practice by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> rulers. The public judicial power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is explicitly mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs17">Matthew 18:17</a>), and the exercise of it is also recorded (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs29">Acts 15:29</a>). In other words, just as the civil state has the legitimate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over its subjects to guide them to the end for which it is instituted, because it is a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, so likewise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being constituted by Christ as a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, possesses within itself all the powers <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for lawfully and effectively attaining the end for which it was established.

<p>As the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> extends not only to its individual members but also to the whole corporate body, not only to questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> but also to the public actions of its subjects, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> is distinguished into that of the internal and external forum. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the internal forum deals with questions concerning the welfare of individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and with their relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence it is called the forum of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> (<em>Forum conscientiae</em>). It is also denominated the forum of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> (<em>forum poli</em>) because it guides the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the path to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The internal forum is subdivided into the sacramental or penitential, which is exercised in the tribunal of penance or at least is connected with it, and the extra penitential forum. Causes concerning the private and secret needs of the faithful can often be expedited outside the sacramental confession. Thus, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> may be dispensed, secret censures may be absolved, occult impediments of matrimony may be dispensed outside of the tribunal of penance. The internal forum deals therefore directly with the spiritual welfare of the individual faithful. It has reference to the corporate body only secondarily, in as much as the good of the whole organization is promoted by that of the individual members. Owing to the nature of the civil state and the end for which it was instituted, it has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> corresponding to the ecclesiastical forum of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Finally, it may so chance that circumstances may bring about a conflict between the internal and external forum. Thus, for example, a marriage may be null and void in the forum of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but binding in the external forum for want of judicial <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to the contrary, and vice versa.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum has reference to matters touching the public and social good of the corporate body. It corresponds, consequently, very closely to the powers exercised by civil magistrates in affairs belonging to their competence. While the external forum may busy itself with the concerns of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, it does so only in as far as these affect the public good. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> belongs to the internal forum, but the concession of the faculty for performing such <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is an act of the external forum. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the external forum is subdivided into <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Voluntary, or extra-judicial, is that which a superior can exercise towards those who invoke his power, or even against those who are unwilling, but without his using the formalities prescribed in law. Necessary or contentious <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is that which the judge employs in punishing crimes or deciding disputes according to prescribed forms. In general, the acts of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the external forum are the decision of disputes concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> or discipline, the making and enforcing the of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the punishment of transgressors of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, and the like.

<p>The competence of the ecclesiastical forum arises either from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or the cause to be judged. As to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are subject to its judgments both in civil and criminal causes (see CLERICAL IMMUNITIES). As to causes: they may be purely civil, or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, or they may be mixed. Purely civil causes would not of themselves properly belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> forum, as she recognizes the full competence of the state in such matters. Accidentally, however, such causes might be brought before the <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a>. This supposes, however, the practical recognition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> forum by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Ecclesiastical causes themselves are called civil when they concern either spiritual things, as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or matters connected with them, as <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, the right of patronage, etc. They are called criminal when they involve the dealing with delinquents guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, apostasy, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the like. They are called mixed causes when they are subjects proper for decision by either the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or civil forum, as <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurious</a> contracts, <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, violations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> peace, etc. Causes are likewise called mixed when they have both a spiritual and temporal end. Thus matrimony, in its sacramental nature as to validity or nullity, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; in its temporal aspect, as to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and similar things, it may be dealt with by the civil tribunals. To this class of mixed causes can also be reduced the suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, where <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> cooperate with each other for the maintenance of the integrity or the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the preservation of the civil peace. Finally, many causes, of their nature civil, are accounted mixed by canonists, either because the State relinquished them to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> tribunals or custom gradually caused them to be relegated to the ecclesiastical forum, such as the recognition of last wills and testaments, the care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, etc

<p>The punishments which may be inflicted by the external ecclesiastical forum are not only spiritual as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, but also temporal or corporal. As regards the infliction of the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a>, canonists generally hold that ecclesiastical law forbids inferior church tribunals to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> this punishment directly, but that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> has the power, at least indirectly, in as much as they can demand that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> state inflict this punishment when the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> requires it. Finally, they hold that there is no valid argument to prove that the direct exercise of this power does not fall within the competence of the ecclesiastical forum, although it was the custom of the latter to hand over the criminal to the secular arm for the infliction of the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a>. The encroachments of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> have in our days, practically though unwarrantly, restricted the ecclesiatical forum to spiritual causes only.
