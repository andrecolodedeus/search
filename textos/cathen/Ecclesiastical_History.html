<h1>Ecclesiastical History</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Nature and office</h2>

<p>Ecclesiastical history is the scientific investigation and the methodical description of the temporal development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> considered as an institution founded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and guided by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.

<p>In a general way the subject matter of history is everything that suffers change owing to its existence in time and space; more particularly, however, it is the genetical or natural development of facts, events, situations, that history contemplates. The principal subject of history is man, since the external changes in his life affect closely his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> interests. Objectively speaking, history is the genetical development of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> itself in its various aspects, as it comes before us in series of facts, whether these pertain to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, or to the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, or to any of its various groups. Viewed subjectively, history is the apperception and description of this development, and, in the scientific sense, the comprehension of the same set forth in a methodical and systematic manner.

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> may have as many divisions as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> has aspects or sides. Its noblest form is the history of religion, as it developed in the past among the different groups of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Reason shows that there can be only one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, based on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the proper worship of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thanks to the light of revelation we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and, since there are different forms of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is in particular the one known as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, concrete and visible in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, therefore, or more properly the history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is the most important and edifying part of the history of religion. Furthermore, the history of religion is necessarily a history of religious associations, since the specifically human, that is, moral &#151; and therefore religious &#151; life, is necessarily social in character. Every religion, therefore, aims naturally at some form of social organization, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> all the more so, since it is the highest and most perfect religion. There are three stages in the formation of religious associations: <ol><li>The religious associations of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, i.e. of those who had or have no clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>. Among them every people has its own gods, religion coincides with nationality and lives no independent life, while the religious association is closely connected or rather wholly bound up with the civil order, and is, like the latter, essentially particularistic. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Although this also was closely connected with the theocratic government of the Jewish people, and hence particularistic and confined to one nation, it was still the custodian of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. <li><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which contains the fullness or perfection of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, made known to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself. In it are realized all the prototypes that appear in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. By its very nature it is universal, destined for all men and all ages. It differs profoundly from all other organizations, lives its own independent life, possesses in its fullness all religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>, recognizes the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as its highest principle, and penetrates and comprehends the whole spiritual life of man. Its cult is at once the sublimest and purest form of Divine worship. It is in every sense without a peer among human associations.</ol>

<p>The annals of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in its widest sense are occasionally dated from the creation of man, seeing that a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> was made to him from the beginning. However, since Christ is the founder of the perfect religion which derives from Him its name, and which He established as a free and independent association and a sublime common possession of the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> maybe more naturally taken to begin with the earthly life of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The historian, however, must deal with the ages preceding this momentous period, in so far as they prepared <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> for the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and are a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> elucidation of those factors which influenced the historical development of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">NATURAL LAW</a>; <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">DIVINE LAW</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">GOD</a>.)

<p>The external historical form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, viewed as the religious association of all the faithful who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ, is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As the institution which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> founded for the realization on earth of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> and for the sanctification of man, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has a double element, the Divine and the human. The Divine element comprises all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of Faith which her Founder entrusted to her &#151; His legislation and the fundamental principles of her organization as an institute destined for the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the practice of Divine worship, and the guardianship of all the means by which man receives and sustains his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life (see <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">SACRAMENTS</a>; <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). The human element in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> appears in the manner in which the Divine element manifests itself with the co-operation of the human <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and under the influence of earthly factors. The Divine element is unchangeable, and, strictly speaking, does not fall within the scope of history; the human element on the other hand is subject to change and development, and it is owing to it that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has a history. Change appears first of all by reason of the extension of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world since its foundation. During this expansion various influences revealed themselves, partly from within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, partly from without, in consequence of which the expansion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was either hindered or advanced. The inner life of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> is influenced by various factors: moral earnestness, for example, and a serious realization of the aims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> promote the attainment of her interests; on the other hand, when a worldly spirit and a low standard of morality infect many of her members, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> action is gravely impeded. Consequently although the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is in itself, as to its material content, unchangeable considered as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, there is still room for a formal development of our scientific apprehension and explanation of it by means of our natural faculties. The development of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> and constitution, of the worship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of the legislation and discipline which regulate the relations between the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and maintain order, offers not a few changes which are a proper subject for historical investigation.



<p>We are now in a position to grasp the scope of ecclesiastical history. It consists in the scientific investigation and methodical treatment of the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in all its manifestations from the beginning of its existence to our own day among the various divisions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> hitherto reached by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. While the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> remains essentially the same despite the changes which she undergoes in time, these changes help to exhibit more fully her internal and external life. As to the latter, ecclesiastical history makes known in detail the local and temporal expansion or restriction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the various countries, and indicates the factors influencing the same (History of Missions, in the widest sense), also the attitude which individual states or political bodies and other religious associations assume towards her (History of Ecclesiastical Polity, of Heresies and their Refutation, and of the Relations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with Non-Catholic Religious Associations). If we turn to the internal life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ecclesiastical history treats of the development of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teaching, based on the original <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (History of Dogma, of Ecclesiastical Theology, and Ecclesiastical Sciences in general), of the development of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> worship in its various forms (History of Liturgy), of the utilization of the arts in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially in connexion with worship (History of Ecclesiastical Art), of the forms of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government and the exercise of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions (History of the Hierarchy, of the Constitution and Law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), of the different ways of cultivating the perfect <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> (History of Religious Orders), of the manifestations of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and sentiment among the people, and of the disciplinary rules whereby <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality is cultivated and preserved and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are sanctified (History of Discipline, Religious Life, Christian Civilization.)
<h2 id="section2">Method and characteristics</h2>

<p>The ecclesiastical historian must apply the principles and general rules of the historical method exactly and in their entirety, and must accept at their proper value all facts which have been proved to be certain. The cornerstone of all historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is the careful establishment of facts. The ecclesiastical historian will accomplish this by a full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and critical treatment of the sources. An objective, reasonable, and unbiased interpretation of the sources, based on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of criticism, is the first principle of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> method of ecclesiastical history. Systematic instruction in this field is obtained through the historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> usually known as auxiliary or introductory, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11403a.htm">pal&aelig;ography</a>, diplomatics, and criticism.

<p>Secondly, in discussing the facts, ecclesiastical history must ascertain and explain the relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect in the events. it is not sufficient merely to establish a certain series of events in their objective appearance; the historian is also bound to lay bare their causes and effects. Nor does it suffice to consider only those factors which lie on the surface and are suggested by the events themselves, as it were: the internal, deeper, and real causes must be brought to light. As in the physical world there is no effect without an adequate cause, so too in the spiritual and moral world every phenomenon has its particular cause, and is in turn the cause of other phenomena. In the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and religious world the facts are the concrete realization or outcome of definite spiritual <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and forces, not only in the life of the individual, but also in that of groups and associations. Individuals and groups without exception are members of the one <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a> created for a sublime destiny beyond this mortal life. Thus, the action of the individual exercises its influence on the development of the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, and this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in a special manner of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Ecclesiastical history must therefore give us an insight into this moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and lay clearly before us the development of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> active therein, as they appear both in the individual and in the groups of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Moreover, to discover fully the really decisive causes of a given event, the historian must take into account all the forces that concur in producing it. This is particularly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of man, a consideration of great importance in forming a judgment about <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> phenomena. It follows that the influence of given <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> on the development of the whole body must be properly appreciated. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> once current in religious, social, and political spheres, and which often survive in the masses of the people, must be justly appreciated, for they help, though as a rule imperceptibly, to determine the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acts of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and thereby to prepare the way for the work of especially prominent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and thus make possible the influence of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> upon the whole race. Scientific church history must therefore take into consideration both the individual and the general factors in its investigation of the genetic connexion of the outward phenomena, at the same time never losing sight of the freedom of man's will. The ecclesiastical historian, moreover, can by no means exclude the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> factors. That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot intervene in the course of nature, and that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are therefore impossible is an assumption which has not been and cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and which makes a correct appreciation of facts in their objective reality impossible. Herein appears the difference between the standpoint of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> historian, who bears in mind not only the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> but also the <a href="../cathen/06614a.htm">relations of creatures to Him</a>, and that of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> and infidel historian, who rejects even the possibility of Divine intervention in the course of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p>The same difference of principle appears in the teleological appreciation of the several phenomena and their causal connexion. The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> ecclesiastical historian is not satisfied with establishing the facts and ascertaining the internal relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect; he also estimates the value and importance of the events in their relation to the object of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose sole Christ-given aim is to realize the Divine economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for the individual as well as for the whole race and its particular groups. This ideal, however, was not pursued with equal intensity at all times. External causes often exercised great influence. In his judgment on such events, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> historian keeps in view the fact that the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was instituted by Him in order to communicate to the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through Christ. It is from this standpoint that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> historian estimates all particular events in their relation to the end or purpose of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The unbelieving historian on the other hand recognizing only natural forces both at the origin and throughout the development of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and rejecting the possibility of any <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> intervention is incapable of appreciating the work of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in as far as it is the agent of Divine design.

<p>The foregoing considerations enable us also to understand in what sense ecclesiastical history should be pragmatical. The ecclesiastical historian applies first that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> pragmatism which traces the genesis of events from a natural standpoint and in the light of the philosophy of history, and tries to discover the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which underlie or are embodied in them. But to this must be added <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> pragmatism, which takes its stand on <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and strives to recognize the agency of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His providence, and thus to trace (as far as it is possible for the created mind) the eternal purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as it manifests itself in time. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historian insists on the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, its doctrines, institutions, and standards of life, in so far as they rest on <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, and acknowledge the continual guidance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. All this is for him objective reality, certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the only foundation for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, scientific pragmatism of ecclesiastical history. This view does not hinder or weaken, but rather guides and confirms the natural historical understanding of events, as well as their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> critical investigation and treatment. It also includes full recognition and use of the scientific historical method. As a matter of fact, the history of the Church exhibits most clearly a special guidance and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence of God</a>.

<p>A final characteristic, which ecclesiastical history has in common with every other species of history, is impartiality. This consists in freedom from every unfounded and personal prejudice against <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or facts, in an honest willingness to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as conscientious investigation has revealed it, and to describe the facts or events as they were in reality; in the words of Cicero, to assert no falsehood and to hide no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (ne quid falsi dicere audeat, ne quid veri dicere non audeat, "De Oratore", II, ix, 15). It by no means consists in setting aside those <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> we have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or in stripping off all religious convictions. To demand from the ecclesiastical historian an absence of all antecedent views (<em>Voraussetzungslosigkeit</em>) is not only entirely unreasonable, but an offence against historical objectivity. It could be maintained only on the hypothesis "<em>ignoramus et ignorabimus</em>", that is that the end of scientific investigation is not the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but merely the seeking after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without ever finding it. Such a hypothesis, however, it is quite impossible to defend, for the assertion of <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> that <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or even plain objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of any kind, is beyond our reach, is itself an antecedent hypothesis upon which the unbelieving historian bases his investigations. It is therefore only a simulated impartiality, which the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> historian displays when he prescinds entirely from religion and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Division</h2>

<p>The rich and abundant material for scientific investigation that the long life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> offers us, has been variously treated by historians. We must first mention the great exhaustive works of a universal nature, in which the entire temporal development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is taken into account (Universal Ecclesiastical History); alongside of these works we find numerous researches on <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and particular institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Special Ecclesiastical History). These particular expositions treat either of the internal or external life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as has been explained at length above, and thus lead to a distinction between internal and external history. There are, however, many works which must consider both phases of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>: to this class belong not only works on church history in general, but also many whose scope is confined to definite spheres (e.g. Histories of the Popes). Special ecclesiastical history falls naturally into three main classes. First we meet with accounts of the lives and activity of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> (Biographies), who were during their lifetime of special importance for the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover special ecclesiastical history treats of particular parts and divisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in such a manner that either the whole history of a given part is discussed or only selected features of the same. Thus we have historical descriptions of single countries or parts of them, e.g. <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, churches. To it also belongs the history of missions, a subject of far-reaching importance. Finally, after a selection of special subjects from the entire mass of material (especially of the internal history of the Church), these are separately investigated and treated. Thus we have the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, of councils, collections of the lives and <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legends of the saints</a>, the history of orders and congregations; also of patrology, <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, liturgy, worship, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, constitution, and social institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Universal history of the Church</h2>

<p>The office of universal ecclesiastical history is, as its name implies, to exhibit a well-balanced description of all phases of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. The investigation and treatment of the various phenomena in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> furnish the material of which universal church history is built. It must first treat of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church which from the time of the Apostles, by its uninterrupted existence and its unique attributes, has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> association which is alone in full possession of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It must, moreover, deal with those other religious associations which claim to be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in reality originated through separation from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historian does not admit that the various forms of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> may be taken, roughly speaking, as a connected whole, nor does he consider them one and all as so many imperfect attempts to adapt the teachings and institutions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the changing needs of the times, nor as progressive steps towards a future higher unity wherein alone we must seek the perfect ideal of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. There is but one <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> given us by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but one <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> based on it; hence one only Church can be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which the aforesaid revelation is found in its entirety, and whose institutions have developed on the basis of this revelation and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. To assume equality among the various forms of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> would be equivalent to a denial of the Divine origin and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>While, however, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the central subject of universal ecclesiastical history, all other forms of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> must also be considered by it, for they originated by secession from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, and their founders, in so far as each form can be traced back to a founder, were externally members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Some of these separated bodies still retain among their institutions certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> forms which were in common use at the time of their separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wherefore a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such institutions is of no little use to students of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions previous to the separation. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in a special manner of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christian communities</a>, their liturgy and discipline. Moreover, such <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> bodies became, as a rule, the bitterest enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; they harassed and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> its faithful adherents and endeavoured in every way to induce them also to secede. New <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> discussions arose as a result of these secessions, ending usually in fuller and more exact statements of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a>, and new methods had to be adopted to nullify the attacks made by <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In this way non-Catholic communities have often indirectly influenced the development of the interior life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the growth of new institutions.

<p>The vast material which, from these points of view, a universal history of the Church must treat, calls of course for methodical arrangement. Ecclesiastical history has generally been divided into three chief periods, each of which is subdivided into shorter epochs characterized by changes of a less universal nature.
<h3 id="A">First period</h3>

<p>The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the development of fixed standards of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life within the limits of Gr&aelig;co-Roman civilization. &#151; In this period the geographical extent of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is practically confined to the Mediterranean lands of the Roman empire. Only in a few places, especially in the Orient, did she overstep its boundaries. The uniform and universal Gr&aelig;co-Roman civilization there prevailing was a propitious soil for the growth of the new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, which displays three main phases. <ul><li>(1) The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, those few but all-important years in which the messengers of <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">God's Kingdom</a>, chosen by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, laid out the ground-plan for all subsequent development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Apostolic Epoch). <li>(2) The expansion and interior formation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> amid more or less violent but ever persistent attacks on the part of the Roman government (Epoch of Persecutions). In the different provinces of the Roman Empire, and in the East even beyond its confines, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities sprang into life guided originally by men who had been appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and who continued their work. Insignificant at first, these communities increased steadily in membership despite the equally steady opposition of the Roman government and its sanguinary attempts at repression. It was then that the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, worship, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> assumed fixed forms that conditioned all later development. <li>(3) The third epoch is characterized by a close union between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, by the consequent privileged position of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the complete conversion of the Roman state (The Christian Empire).</ul>

<p>Heresies regarding the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Incarnate Son of God</a> bring to the front important dogmatical questions. The first great councils belong to this epoch, as well as the rich ecclesiastico-theological literature of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> and administration are developed more fully, the primacy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> standing out conspicuously as in the preceding epoch. Monasticism introduces a new and important factor into the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> place themselves at the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the eastern half of the empire, later known as the Byzantine empire, this development went on quite undisturbed; in the West the barbarian invasion changed radically the political conditions, and imposed on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the urgent and important task of converting and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> new Western nations, a task which she executed with great success. This brought a new element into the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so important that it marks the beginning of a new period.
<h3 id="B">Second period</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as mistress and guide of the new Romanic, German, and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> states of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the secession of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christendom</a> from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity and the final overthrow of the Byzantine empire. &#151; In this period occurred events which for a considerable time greatly affected <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. Three main epochs suggest themselves. <ul><li>(1) The first centuries of this epoch are characterized by the development of a close union between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the new Western <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and by the falling away of the Orient from the centre of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> carried out the great work of civilizing the barbarian nations of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Her activity was consequently very many-sided, and she gained a far-reaching influence not only on religious, but also on political and social life. In this respect the creation of the Western Empire. and its relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were characteristic of the position of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church. A deep decline, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, followed this alliance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> with the Carlovingians. This decline was manifest not only at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, where the factious Roman aristocracy used the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as political tools, but also in different parts of the West. Through the intervention of the German emperor the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> resumed their proper position, but at the same time the influence of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> on the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> grew dangerous and insupportable. The action of Photius, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, led to a rupture with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was destined to become final. <li>(2) A second part of this period shows how the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Christian West</a> grew into the great fellowship of the peoples under the supreme guidance of a common religious authority. Popular life everywhere reflects this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> universalism. In the conflict with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> succeeded in carrying through <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms, and at the same time set afoot in the West the great movement of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. All public interests centered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. Nobles and commonalty, filled with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, furthered vigorously through powerful associations the aims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> rose to the zenith of its power, not only in the religious, but also in the temporal domain. New orders, particularly the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a>, fostered a genuine <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in every rank of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> became the centres of a notable <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity, devoted for the most part to the development of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The building of magnificent churches was undertaken in the cities and was an evidence at once of the religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and the vigorous self-confidence of the inhabitants. This powerful position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her representatives entailed, nevertheless, many dangers, arising on the one hand from the increasing worldliness of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and on the other from the opposition to an excessive centralization of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> curia, and the antagonism of princes and nations to the political power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors, particularly the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. <li>(3) In consequence a third epoch of this period is filled with reaction against the evils of the preceding time, and with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> results of wide-spread worldliness in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the decline of sincerely <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> won a famous victory in its conflict with the German Hohenstaufen, but it soon fell under the influence of the French kings, suffered a grievous loss of authority through the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> and had difficulty at the time of the reform councils (<a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, Basle) in stemming a strong anti-papal tide. Furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> grew more fully conscious of itself, more secular in temper, and frequently hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; civil encroachments on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domain multiplied. In general, the spheres of spiritual and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and those of the State, were not definitely outlined until after many conflicts, for the most part detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> introduced a new and secular element into <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life; it dethroned from their supremacy the long dominant <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, disseminated widely <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and materialistic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and opposed its own methods to those of scholasticism, which had in many ways degenerated. The new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> took on a more general character. The call for "reform of head and members", so loudly voiced in the councils of those days, seemed to justify the growing opposition to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. In the councils themselves a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> constitutionalism contended for the supreme administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the immemorial <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy. So many painful phenomena suggest the presence of great abuses in the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the West. Simultaneously, the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> was completely overthrown by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> gained a strong foothold in south-eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and threatened the entire <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Christian West</a>.</ul>
<h3 id="C">Third period</h3>

<p>The collapse of religious unity among the two western nations, and the reformation from within of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, accomplished during the conflict against the latest of the great <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.  &#151; Immense geographical expansion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> owing to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> activity of her missionaries through whom South America, part of North America and numerous adherents in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa, were gained for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In this period, also, which reaches to our own time, we rightly discern several shorter epochs during which <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life is characterized by peculiar and distinctive traits and phenomena. <ul><li>(1) The civil life of the various Western peoples was no longer regarded as identified with the life and aims of the Universal Church. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> cut off whole nations, especially in Central and Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity and entered on a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has not yet terminated. On the other hand, the faithful adherents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were more closely united, while the great <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Ecumenical Council of Trent</a> laid a firm foundation for a thorough reformation in the inner or domestic life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which was soon realized through the activity of new orders (especially the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>) and through an extraordinary series of great <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> again devoted themselves exclusively to their religious mission and took up the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reforms with great energy. The newly discovered countries of the West, and the changed relations between <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the Eastern nations aroused in many missionaries a very active <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world. The efforts of these messengers of the Faith were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with such success that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in some measure compensated for the defection in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <li>(2) The subsequent epoch shows again a decline of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Since the middle of the seventeenth century, there exist three great religious associations: the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the Greek <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> church, which found a powerful protector in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, together with the smaller <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> churches of the East; <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, which, however, never constituted a united religious association, but split up constantly into numerous <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, accepted the direct supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, and was by the latter organized in each land as a national church. The growing absolutism of states and princes was in this way strongly furthered. In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries also the princes tried to use the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as an "instrumentum regni", and to weaken as much as possible the influence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Public life lost steadily its former salutary contact with a universal and powerful religion. Moreover, a thoroughly infidel philosophy now levelled its attacks against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation in general. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> rapidly begot a race of unbelievers and shallow <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a> who spread on all sides a superficial scepticism. The political issue of so many fatal influences was the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, which in turn inflicted the severest injuries on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. <li>(3) With the nineteenth century appeared the modern constitutional state based on principles of the broadest political liberty. Although in the first decades of the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was often hampered in her work by the downfall of the old political system, she nevertheless secured liberty under the new national popular government, fully developed her own religious energies, and in most countries was able to exhibit an upward movement in every sphere of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> guided this advance with a strong hand despite the loss of their <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">&OElig;cumenical Council of the Vatican</a>, by defining <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, supported with firmness <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority against a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> subjectivism. The defection of the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> was relatively unimportant. While <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> is the daily prey of infidelity and loses steadily all claim to be considered a religion based on <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> appears in its compact unity as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> guardian of the unadulterated deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which its Divine Founder originally entrusted to it. The conflict is ever more active between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the champion of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, and infidelity, which aims at supremacy in public life, politics, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, literature, and art. The non-European countries begin to play an important role in the world, and point to new fields of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> activity. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> faithful have increased so rapidly during the last century, and the importance of several non-European countries on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life has taken on such proportions, that the universal history of the Church is becoming more and more a religious history of the world.</ul>

<p>The great turning-points in the historical development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do not appear suddenly or without due cause. As a rule divers important events occurring within the shorter epochs bring about eventually a change of universal import for the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and compel us to recognize the arrival of a new period. Naturally, between these prominent turning-points there are shorter or longer intervals of transition, so that the exact limits of the chief periods are variously set down by different ecclesiastical historians, according to the importance which they severally attach to one or the other of the aforesaid momentous events or situations. The division between the first and second periods has its justification in the fact that, owing to the downfall of the Western Roman Empire and to the relations between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the new Western nations, essentially new forms of life were called into being, while in the East Byzantine culture had become firmly established. The turning-point between the old and the new state of things did not, however, immediately follow the conversion of the Teutonic tribes; a considerable time elapsed before Western life was moving easily in all its new forms. Some (Neander, Jacobi, Baur, etc.) consider the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> in 590, or (Moeller, M&uuml;ller), more generally, the end of the sixth and the middle of the seventh century as the close of the first period; others (<a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, Kurtz) take the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> in 680, or (<a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a>, <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, von Funk, Kn&ouml;pfler) the Trullan synod of 692, or the end of the seventh century; others again close the first period with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> (Ritter, Niedner), or with the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a> (Gieseler, M&ouml;hler), or with <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Hase, Weingarten). For the West Kraus regards the beginning of the seventh century as the close of the first period; for the East, the end of the same century. Speaking generally, however, it seems more reasonable to accept the end of the seventh century as the close of the first period. Similarly, along the line of division between the second and the third periods are crowded events of great importance to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life: the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> with its influence upon all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life, the conquest of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the discovery of America and the new problems which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had to solve in consequence, the appearance of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> with its decisive influence on the evolution of the interior life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians regard the appearance of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> as the beginning of the third period. A few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors (e.g. Kraus) close the second period with the middle of the fifteenth century; it is to be noted, however, that the new historical factors in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which condition the third period become prominent only after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, itself an important result of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. It seems, therefore, advisable to regard the beginning of the sixteenth century as the commencement of the third period.

<p>Nor do authors perfectly agree on the turning-points which are to be inserted within the chief periods. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the conversion of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> affected the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so profoundly that the reign of this first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor is generally accepted as marking a sub-division in the first period. In the second period, especially prominent personalities usually mark the limits of the several sub-divisions, e.g. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, though this leads to the undervaluation of other important factors e.g. the Greek Schism, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Recent writers, therefore, assume other boundary lines which emphasize the forces active in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rather than prominent personalities. In subdividing the third period the same difficulty presents itself. Many historians consider the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> at the end of the eighteenth century as an event of sufficient importance to demand a new epoch; others, more reasonably perhaps see a distinct epochal line in the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648), with which the formation of great <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> territories came to an end. From the above considerations we deduce the following chronological arrangement of general ecclesiastical history:
<h3 id="A">First period</h3>

<p>Origin and Development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the ancient Gr&aelig;co-Roman world (from the birth of Christ to the close of the seventh century). <ul><li>(a) First Epoch: Foundation, expansion and formation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> despite the oppression of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>-Roman state (from Christ to the Edict of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 313). <li>(b) Second Epoch: The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in close connexion with the Christian-Roman Empire (from the Edict of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to the Trullan Synod, 692).</ul>
<h3 id="B">Second period</h3>

<p>The Church as the guide of the Western nations (from the close of the seventh century to the beginning of the sixteenth). <ul><li>(a) First Epoch: The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in alliance with the Carlovingians, decadence of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the West, isolation of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> and its final rupture with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Trullan Synod to <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, 1054). <li>(b) Second Epoch: Interior reformation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life through the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, flourishing of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, acme of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> (from 1054 to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, 1303). <li>(c) Third Epoch: Decline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>; decay of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and outcry for reforms (from 1303 to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, 1521).</ul>
<h3 id="C">Third period</h3>

<p>The Church after the collapse of the religious unity in the West, struggle against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and infidelity, expansion in non-European countries (from beginning of sixteenth century to our own age). <ul><li>(a) First Epoch: Origin and expansion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>; conflict with that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and reformation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life (from 1521 to Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 1648). <li>(b) Second Epoch: Oppression of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by state-absolutism, weakening of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> through the influence of a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> emancipation (from 1648 to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, 1789). <li>(c) Third Epoch: Oppression of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; renewal of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life struggling against infidelity; progress of missionary activity (from 1789).</ul>

<p>As regards the methodical treatment of the subject-matter within the principal divisions, most writers endeavour to treat the main phases of the internal and external history of the Church in such a manner as to secure a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> arrangement throughout each period. Deviations from this method are only exceptional, as when <a href="../cathen/04636a.htm">Darras</a> treats each pontificate separately. This latter method is, however, somewhat too mechanical and superficial, and in the case of lengthy periods it becomes difficult to retain a clear grasp of the facts and to appreciate their interconnexion. Recent writers, therefore, aim at such a division of the matter within the different periods as will lay more stress on the important forms and expressions of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life (Moeller, Muller, Kirsch in his revision of <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>). The larger periods are divided into a number of shorter epochs, in each of which the most important event or situation in the history of the Church stands out with distinctness, other phases of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life &#151; including the ecclesiastical history of the individual countries &#151; being treated in connexion with this central subject. The subject-matter of each period thus receives a treatment at once chronological and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, and most in keeping with the historical development of the events portrayed. The narrative gains in lucidity and artistic finish, within the shorter periods the historical material is more easily grasped, while the active forces in all great movements appear in bolder relief. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that this method involves a certain inequality in the treatment of the various phases of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, but the same inequality already existed in the historical situation described.
<h2 id="section5">Sources of ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>Historical sources are those human products which were either originally intended, or which &#151; on account of their existence, origin, and other conditions &#151; are preeminently fitted, to furnish <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and evidence of historical facts. The sources of ecclesiastical history are therefore whatever things, either because of their object or of other circumstances, can throw light on the facts that make up the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of the past. These sources fall naturally into two classes: <ul><li>(A) Remains (<em>reliqui&oelig;, Ueberreste</em>) or immediate sources, i.e. such as prove a fact directly, being themselves part or remnant of the fact. To this class belong remains in the narrower sense of the word, e.g. <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> customs, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, acts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils, art-products etc.; also monuments set up to commemorate events, e.g. inscriptions. <li>(B) Tradition or mediate sources, i.e. such as rest upon the statements of witnesses who communicate an event to others. Tradition may be oral (narrative and legends), written (writings of particular authors), or pictorial (pictures, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>).</ul>

<p>The critical treatment of the two kinds of sources differs. It is usually sufficient to prove the authenticity and integrity of "remains" in order to establish the validity of their evidence. In dealing with tradition, on the other hand, it must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the author of the source in question deserves credit, also that it was possible for him to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the fact. The sources are further divided: <ul><li>(a) according to their origin, into <em>divine</em> (the canonical sacred writings) and <em>human</em> (all other sources); <li>(b) according to the position of the author, into <em>public</em> (such as originated from an official <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or magistrate, e.g. <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> writings, decrees of councils, pastoral letters of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, rules of orders etc.) and <em>private</em> (such as come from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> holding no public office, or from an official in his private capacity, e.g. biographies, works of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, private letters etc.); <li>(c) according to the religion of the author, into <em>domestic</em> (of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> origin) and <em>foreign</em> (i.e. written by non-Christians); <li>(d) according to the manner of transmission, into <em>written</em> (inscriptions, public acts, writings of all kinds) and <em>unwritten</em> (monuments, art-products stories, legends etc.).</ul>

<p>The aforesaid historical sources have in modern times been fully and critically investigated by numerous scholars and are now easily accessible to all in good editions. A very general outline of these sources will suffice here (see special articles in this Encyclopedia).
<h3 id="A">Remains</h3>

<p>The remains of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> past, which give direct evidence of historical facts, are the following: <ol><li>Inscriptions, i.e. texts written on durable material, which were either meant to perpetuate the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain acts, or which describe the character and purpose of a particular object. The <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> of different epochs and countries are now accessible in numerous collections. <li>Monuments erected for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> purposes, especially <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, sacred edifices, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for the sick and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; objects used in the liturgy or <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a>. <li>Liturgies, rituals, particularly <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of various kinds, which were once used in Divine service. <li>Necrologies and confraternity-books used at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and public services for the living and the dead. <li>Papal acts, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and Briefs to a great extent edited in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Bullaria", "Regesta", and special ecclesiastico-national collections. <li>Acts and decrees of <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> and of particular <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. <li>Collections of official decrees of <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. <li>Rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (Symbola fldei) drawn up for the public use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, various collections of which have been made. <li>Official collections of ecclesiastical laws juridically <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for the whole Church. <li>Rules and constitutions of orders and congregations. <li>Concordats between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. <li>Civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> since they often contain matters bearing on religion or of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interest.</ol>
<h3 id="B">Tradition</h3>

<p>We speak here of those sources which rest on mere tradition, and which, unlike the remains, are themselves no part of the fact. They are: <ul><li>(1) Collections of acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, of legends and lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <li>(2) Collections of lives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (<a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>) and of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of particular Churches. <li>(3) Works of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, which contain information about historical events; to some extent all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature belongs to this category. <li>(4) Ecclesiastico-historical works, which take on more or less the character of sources, especially for the time in which their authors lived. <li>(5) Pictorial representations (paintings, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, etc.).</ul>

<p>The foregoing are accessible in various collections, partly in editions of the works of particular authors (<a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, historians), partly in historical collections which contain writings of different authors correlated in content, or all the traditional written sources for a given land.
<h2 id="section6">Auxiliary sciences</h2>

<p>The basis of all historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is the proper treatment and use of the sources. The ecclesiastical historian must therefore master the sources in their entirety, examine them as to their trustworthiness, understand them correctly, and use methodically the information gleaned from them.

<p>Systematic guidance in all these matters is afforded by certain <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, known as the "auxiliary historical sciences". Since ecclesiastical history is so closely related to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> on the one hand, and on the other to the historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all is generally speaking a prerequisite for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> study of church history. How to treat the sources critically is best learned from a good manual of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> introduction to the study of history (Bernheim); special auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> (e.g. epigraphy, <a href="../cathen/11403a.htm">pal&aelig;ography</a>, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>) deal with certain particular kinds of the above-mentioned sources.

<p>Of these helps we may mention:<ol>
<li><strong><em>The study of the languages of the sources</em></strong>, which necessitates the use of lexicons, either general or special (i.e. for the language of particular authors). Among the general lexicons or <a href="../cathen/06588a.htm">glossaries</a> are: <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Fresne du Cange</a>, "Glossarium ad scriptores medi&aelig; et infim&aelig; gr&aelig;citatis" (2 vols., Lyons, 1688); Idem, "Glossarium ad scriptores medi&aelig; et infim&aelig; latinitatis"; <a href="../cathen/06134a.htm">Forcellini</a>, "Lexicon totius latinitatis" (Padua, 1771, often reprinted). "Thesaurus lingu&aelig; latin&aelig;" (begun at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 1900).
<li><strong><em>Pal&oelig;ography</em></strong>, a methodical introduction to the reading and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> sources. It was first scientifically investigated and formulated by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, "De re diplomatic&acirc;" (Paris, 1681); the literature on this subject is to be found in the manuals of de Wailly, "Elements de Pal&eacute;ographie" (2 vols., Paris, 1838); Wattenbach, "Latein. Pal&auml;og." (4th ed., Leipzig, 1886) and "Schriftwesen im Mittelalter" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1896); E. M. Thompson, "Handbook of Greek and Latin Pal&aelig;ography" (2nd ed., London, 1894); Prou, "Manuel de Pal&eacute;ographie latine et fran&ccedil;aise" (Paris, 1904); Chassant, "Pal&eacute;ographie des chartes et des manuscrits" (8th ed., Paris, 1885); <a href="../cathen/12799a.htm">Reusens</a>, "Elements de pal&eacute;ogr." (Louvain, 1899); Paoli, "Paleografia" (3 vols., Florence, 1888-1900). Charts for practice in reading <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were edited by: Wattenbach, "Script. gr&aelig;c. specimina" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1897); Sickel, "Monum. graph. medil &aelig;vi" (10 series, 1858-82); Bond, Thompson, and Warner, "Facsimiles" (5 series, London, 1873-1903); <a href="../cathen/04700a.htm">Delisle</a>, "Album pal&eacute;ogr."

(2nd ed., 3 parts, Trier, 1907-); Zangemeister and Wattenbach, "Exempla cod. latin." (1876-9); Sickel and Sybel, "Kaiserurkunden in Abbildungen (1880-91); Pflugk-Harttung, "Chartarum pont. Rom. specimina" (3 parts, 1881-6); <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Specimina pal&aelig;ographica ab Inn. III ad Urban. V" (Rome, 1888), A very useful work is Capelli, "Dizionario di abbreviature latine ed italiane" (Milan, 1899).
<li><strong><em>Diplomatics</em></strong>, which teaches how to examine critically the form and content of historical documents (e.g. charters, <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>), to pronounce on their genuineness, to understand them correctly, and to use them methodically. It is usually combined with paleography. The literature may be found in recent manuals, e.g. Bresslau, "Handbuch der Urkundenlehre f&uuml;r Deutschland und Italien", I (Leipzig, 1889); Giry, "Manuel de diplomatique" (Paris, 1894). See also "Nouveau trait&eacute; de diplomatique" (Paris, 1750-65).
<li><strong><em>Historical Methodology</em></strong>, which enables the student to treat in a correct and critical way all the sources known to him and to combine the results of his researches in a methodical narrative. See Fr. Blass, "Hermeneutik und Kritik" in Iwan M&uuml;ller's "Handbuch der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft", I (2nd ed., Munich, 1893); Bernheim, "Lehrbuch der historischen Methode" (3rd ed., Leipzig, 1903); Idem, "Das akademische Studium der Geschichtswissenschaft (2nd ed., Greifswald, 1907); Idem, "Einleitung in die Geschichtswissenschaft" in "Sammlung Goschen" (Leipzig, 1906); Zurbonsen, "Anleitung zum wissenschaftlichen Studium der Geschichte nebst Materialien" (Berlin, 1906); "Grundriss der Geschichtswissenschaft", edited by Al. Meister, I (Leipzig, 1906); Langlois and Saignobos, "Introduction aux &eacute;tudes historiques" (Paris, 1905); Battaini, "Manuale di metodologia storica" (Florence, 1904).
<li><strong><em>Bibliography</em></strong>, a practical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which enables the student to find quickly all the literature bearing on a given ecclesiastico-historical subject. The most important literature is to be found in recent ecclesiastico-historical manuals at the end of the various subjects treated, and is given with especial fulness in the fourth edition of <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther's</a> "Kirchengeschichte" by J.P. Kirsch (Freiburg, 1902-9). Among the bibliographical works of special importance for ecclesiastical history must be named: "Bibliotheca hagiographica latina antiqu&aelig; et medi&aelig; &aelig;tatis", edited by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> (2 vols., Brussels, 1898-1901); Potthast, "Bibliotheca historica medii &aelig;vi" (2nd ed., 2 vols., Berlin, 1896); Bratke, "Wegweiser zu den Quellen und der Literatur der Kirchengeschichte" (Gotha, 1890); Chevalier, "R&eacute;pertoire des sources historiques du moyen-&acirc;ge: I.

A third edition comprises the whole of ecclesiastical history, ibid., 1903-). For the history of the several nations see: Wattenbach, "Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter bis zur Mitte des 13. Jahrh." (6th ed., Berlin, 1894, 7th ed. by Dummler, I, ibid., 1904); Lorenz, "Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter seit der Mitte des 13. Jahrh."

The most complete bibliography of church history is now to be found in "Revue d'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique" (Louvain, since 1900).
<li><strong><em>Chronology</em></strong>, which instructs the student how to recognize and fix with accuracy the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> found in the sources. The first important chronological investigations were undertaken by Scaliger ("De emendatione temporum," Jena, 1629-), <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> ("Rationarium temporum", Leyden, 1624; "De doctrin&acirc; temporum", Antwerp, 1703), and the authors of "Art de v&eacute;rifier les dates des faits historiques" (Paris, 1750-). The most important recent works are: Ideler, "Handbuch der mathem. u. techn. Chronologie" (Berlin, 1825; 2nd ed., 1883); De Mas-Latrie, "Tr&eacute;sor de chronologie, d'histoire et de g&eacute;ographie pour l'&eacute;tude et l'emploi des documents du moyen-&acirc;ge" (Paris, 1889); Brinkmeier, "Praktisches Handbuch der historischen Chronologie aller Zeiten und V&ouml;lker" (2nd ed., Berlin, 1882); R&uuml;hl, "Chronologie des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit" (Berlin, 1897); Lersch, "Einleitung in die Chronologie" (Freiburg, 1899); Grotefend, "Zeitrechnung des deutschen Mittelalters und den Neuzeit" (Hanover, 1891-8); Cappelli, "Cronologia e calendario perpetuo" (Milan, 1906); Ginzel, "Handbuch den mathemat. und technischen Chronologie. Das Zeitrechnungswesen den V&ouml;lker", I (Leipzig, 1906).
<li><strong><em>Ecclesiastical Geography and Statistics</em></strong>, the first teaches us to recognize the places in which historical events took place, the other represents the development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the actual condition of her institutions exhibited synoptically, in tables with corresponding figures, etc. Important works of this kind are: <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christianus" (3 vols., Paris, 1740); <a href="../cathen/10564a.htm">Morcelli</a>, "Africa christiana" (2 vols., Brescia, 1816); Toulotte, "G&eacute;ographie de l'Afrique chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1892-4); <a href="../cathen/15119b.htm">Ughelli</a>, "Italia sacra" (2nd ed., 10 vols., Venice, 1717-22); "Gallia Christiana" by Claude Robert (Paris, 1626), by Denis de Sainte-Marthe and others (new editions, 16 vols., Paris, 1715-); B&ouml;ttcher, "Germania sacra" (2 vols., Leipzig, 1874); <a href="../cathen/10739a.htm">Neher</a>, "Kirchliche Geographie und Statistik" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1864-8); Idem, "Conspectus hierarchi&aelig; catholic&aelig;" (Ibid., 1895); Silbernagl, "Verfassung und gegenw&auml;rtiger Bestand s&auml;mtlicher Kirchen des Orients" (2nd ed., Munich, 1904); Baumgarten, "Die katholische Kirche unserer Zeit und ihre Diener", III (Munich, 1902, 2nd ed., vol.

<li><strong><em>Epigraphy</em></strong>, a guide for the reading and methodical use of the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> on monuments. Works on this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> are: Larfeld, "Griechische Epigraphik" and H&uuml;bner, "R&ouml;mische Epigraphik", both in Iwan M&uuml;ller's "Handbuch der klassischen Altertumskunde", I (2nd ed., Munich, 1892); Reinash, "Trait&eacute; d'&eacute;pigraphie grecque" (Paris, 1886); Cagnat, "Cours d'&eacute;pigraphie latine" (3rd ed., Paris, 1898); <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscriptiones christian&aelig; urbis Rom&aelig;" I and II, "Introductio" (Rome, 1861-88); <a href="../cathen/09105b.htm">Le Blant</a>, "L'&eacute;pigraphie chr&eacute;tienne en Gaule et dans l'Afrique romaine" (Paris, 1890); Idem, "Pal&eacute;ographie des inscriptions latines de la fin du III au VII si&egrave;cle" (Paris, 1898); Grisar, "Le iscrizioni cristiane di Roma negli inizi del medio evo" in "Analecta Romana" (Rome, 1899).
<li><strong><em>Christian Arch&aelig;ology and History of the Fine Arts</em></strong>, from which the student learns how to study <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientifically</a> and to use the monuments which owe their origin to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influences. See <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">CHRISTIAN ARCH&AElig;OLOGY</a> and <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL ART</a>.
<li><strong><em>Numismatics</em></strong>, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of various countries and ages. Since not only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> but also the numerous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who once possessed <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, exercised the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> belongs, at least for certain epochs, to the auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of church history. See Bonanni, "Numismata Pontificum Romanorum" (3 vols., Rome, 1699); "Numismata Pontificum Romanorum et aliarum ecclesiarum" (Cologne, 1704); Vignolius, "Antiqui denarii Romanorum Pontificum a Benedicto XI ad Paulum III" (2 vols., Rome, 1709; new ed. by B.

<li><strong><em>Sphragistics</em></strong>, or the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a> (Gk. <em>spragis</em>, a <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seal</a>). Its object is the study of the various <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a> and stamps used in sealing letters and documents as a guarantee of their <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a>. Besides the works mentioned above under <em>Diplomatics</em>, see Pflugk and Harttung, "Specimina selecta chartarum Pontificum Romanorum", part III, "Bull&aelig;" (Stuttgart, 1887); Idem, "Bullen der P&auml;pste bis zum Ende des XII Jahrh."

<li><strong><em>Heraldry</em></strong>, which teaches the student how to read accurately the coats of arms etc., used by ecclesiastical and secular lords. It frequently throws light on the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of historical personages, the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> or character of particular events, the history of religious monuments. The literature of this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is very extensive. See Brend, "Die Hauptst&uuml;cke der Wappenkunde" (2 vols., Bonn, 1841-9); Idem, "Allgemeine Schriftenkunde der gesammten Wappenwissenschaft"; Seiler, "Geschichte den Heraldik" (Nuremberg, 1884); E. von Sacken, "Katechismus der Heraldik" (5th ed., Leipzig, 1893); Burke, "Encyclopedia of Heraldry" (London, 1878); Davies, "Encyclopedia of Armory" (London, 1904); Pasini-Frassoni, "Essai d'armorial des papes d'apr&egrave;s les manuscrits du Vatican et les monuments publics" (Rome, 1906).</ol>
<h2 id="section7">Literature of ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>The peoples among which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> first spread, possessed a highly developed civilization and a literature rich in works of history. They possessed the historical sense, and though in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times there was little occasion for extended <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> historical works, nevertheless historical records were not wholly wanting. The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was itself largely historical, the Gospels being literally narratives of the life and death of Christ. Soon we meet the accounts of the conflict with the Roman state (Acts of the Apostles) and traditions of widespread <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> suffering (Acts of the Martyrs). The (lost) anti-Gnostic work of Hegesippus also contained historical information. Chronicles were compiled in the third century by <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> and by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, some fragments of which are yet extant. It is only during the fourth century that ecclesiastical history, properly so called, makes its appearance. Any synopsis of its vast materials falls into three periods corresponding to the three main periods of church history.
<h3 id="A">Church historians during the first period</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine (died 340) is rightly styled the "Father of Church History". We are indebted to him for a <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a> (P.G., XIX) and a "Church History" (ibid., XX; latest scientific edition by Schwartz and Mommsen, 2 vols, in "Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der drei ersten Jahrhunderte", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1903-8). The "Church History" was an outgrowth of the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a>, and was the first work to merit fully the name it bore. It first appeared in nine books and covered the time from the death of Christ to the victories of Constantine and Licinius (312 and 313). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> afterwards added a tenth book, which carried the narrative to the victory of Constantine over Licinius (323). He made use of many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> monuments and documents, acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, letters, extracts from earlier <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writings, lists of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and similar sources, often quoting the originals at great length so that his work contains very precious materials not elsewhere preserved. It is therefore of great value, though it pretends neither to completeness nor to the observance of due proportion in the treatment of the subject-matter. Nor does it present in a connected and systematic way the history of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. It is to no small extent a vindication of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, though the author did not primarily intend it as such; it is impossible, however, for any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> history of the Church not to exhibit at once the Divine origin of the latter and its invincible power. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has been often accused of intentional falsification of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but quite <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; it may be admitted, however, that in judging <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or facts he is not entirely unbiased. On the other hand, he has been rightly censured for or his partiality towards <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> and his palliation of the latter's faults ("Vita Constantini" in P.G., XX, 905 sqq.; latest scientific ed. Heikel, "Eusebius' Werke", I, Leipzig, 1902, in "Die griech, christl. Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte"). In his biography of the great emperor, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, it must be remembered, sought to set forth in the most favourable light the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiments of the imperial convert and his great services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. A brief historical treatise of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "On the Martyrs of Palestine", has also been preserved.

<p>This great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> historian found several imitators in the first half of the fifth century; it is to be regretted, however, that the first two general narratives of ecclesiastical history after <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> have been lost &#151; i.e. the "Christian History" of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Philip of Side in Pamphylia (Philippus Sidetes), and the "Church History" of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Philostorgius. Three other early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> histories written about this period are also lost (the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> <a href="../cathen/07303b.htm">Hesychius of Jerusalem</a> (died 433), the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a>, Timotheus of Berytus, and Sabinus of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>). About the middle of the fifth century the "Church History" of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> was continued simultaneously by three writers &#151; an evidence of the esteem in which this work of the "Father of Church History" was held among scholarly <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. All three continuations have reached us. The first was written by <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, an advocate (<em>scholasticus</em>) of Constantinople, who, in his "Church History" (P.G., LXVII, 29-842; ed. Hussey, Oxford, 1853), which he expressly (I, 1) calls a continuation of the work of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, describes in seven books the period from 305 (Abdication of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>) to 439. It is a work of great value. The author is honest, exhibits critical acumen in the use of his sources, and has a clear and simple style. After him, and frequently making use of his history, comes Hermias Sozomenus (or <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>), also an advocate in Constantinople, whose "Church History" in nine books comprises the period from 324 to 425 (P.G., LXVII, 834-1630; ed. Hussey, Oxford, 1860), but is inferior to that of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>. Both these writers are surpassed by the learned Theodoret, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cyrus (died about 458), who, in his "Church History" (P.G., LXXXII, 881-1280; ed. Gaisford, Oxford, 1854), a continuation of the work of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, describes in five books the period from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> (320) to the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> troubles (428). In addition to the writings of his predecessors, <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, he also used those of the Latin scholar Rufinus, and wove many documents into his clear well-written narrative. Theodoret wrote also a "History of the Monks" (P.G., LXXXII, 1283-1496), in which he sets forth the lives of thirty famous ascetics of the Orient. Like the famous "History of the Holy Fathers" ("Historia Lausiaca", so called from one Lausus to whom the book was dedicated by <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, written about 420; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XXXIV, 995-1278; Butler, "The Lausiac History of Palladius", Cambridge, 1898), this work of Theodoret is one of the principal sources for the history of Oriental monasticism. Theodoret also published a "Compendium of Heretical Falsehoods", i.e. a short history of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> with a refutation of each (P.G., LXXXIII, 335-556). Together with the similar "Panarion" of St. Epiphathus (P.G., XLI-XLII), it offers important material to the student of the earliest <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.

<p>During the sixth century these historians, found other continuators. Theodorus Lector compiled a brief compendium (yet unedited) from the works of the above-mentioned three continuators of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>: <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, and Theodoret. He then wrote in two books an independent continuation of this summary as far as the reign of Emperor Justin I (518-27); only fragments of this work have reached us (P.G., LXXXVI, I, 165-228). Zacharias Rhetor, at first an advocate at Berytus in Ph&oelig;nicia and then (at least from 536) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10407a.htm">Mitylene</a> in the Island of Lesbos, composed, while yet a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, an ecclesiastical history, which describes the period from 450 to 491, but is mostly taken up with personal experiences of the author in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine. A Syriac version of this work is extant as books III-VI of a Syriac universal history, while there are also extant some chapters in a Latin version (Laud, "Anecdota Syriaca", Leyden, 1870; P.G., LXXV, 1145-78; Ahrens and Kr&uuml;ger, "Die sogennante Kirchengeschichte des Zacharias Rhetor", Leipzig, 1899). Apart from this history, his inclination towards <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> is also apparent from his biography of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> patriarch, Severus of Antioch, and from his biography of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Isaias, two works extant in a Syriac version (Laud, op. cit., 346-56, edited the "Life of Isaias", and Spanuth, G&ouml;ttingen, 1893, the "Life of Severus"; cf. Nau in "Revue de l'orient chr&eacute;tien", 1901, pp. 26-88). More important still is the "Church History" of <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a> of Antioch, who died about the end of the sixth century. His work is a continuation of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, and Theodoret, and treats in six books the period from 431 to 594. It is based on good sources, and borrows from profane historians but occasionally <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a> is too credulous. For <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, however, his work deserves careful attention (P.G., LXXXVI, I, 2415-886; edd. Bidez and Parmentier in "Byzantine Texts" by J. B. Bury, London, 1899). Among the chronicles that belong to the close of Gr&aelig;co-Roman antiquity, special mention is due to the Chronicon Paschale, so called because the Paschal or <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> canon forms the basis of its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> (P.G., XCII). About the year 700 the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/08475a.htm">John of Niki&ucirc;</a> (Egypt) compiled a universal chronicle; its <em>notiti&oelig;</em> are of great value for the seventh century. This chronicle has been preserved in an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> version ("Chronique de Jean, &eacute;v&ecirc;que de Nikiou", publ. par. H. Zotenberg, Paris, 1883). Zotenberg believes that the work was originally written in Greek and then translated; N&ouml;ldeke ("Gottinger gelehrte Anzeigen", 1881, 587 sqq.) thinks it more probable that the original was Coptic. To the Alexandrian Cosmas, known as the "Indian Voyager" we owe a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> "Topography" of great value for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> geography (ed. Montfaucon, "Collectio nova Patrum et Scriptor. gr&aelig;c", II, Paris, 1706; translated into English by McCrindle, London, 1897). Of great value also for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> geography are the <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notiti&aelig; episcopatuum"</a> (<em>Taktika</em>), or lists of the patriarchal, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> ("Hieroclis Synecdemus et Notiti&aelig; gr&aelig;c&aelig; episcopatuum", ed. Parthey, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1866; "Georgii Cyprii Descriptio orbis Romani", ed. Geizer, Leipzig, 1890). The most important collection of the early Greek historians of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is that of Henri de Valois in three folio volumes (Paris, 1659-73; improved by W. Reading, Cambridge, 1720); it contains <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, Theodoret, <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, and the fragments of Philostorgius and Theodorus Lector.

<p>The ancient Syrian writings of ecclesiastico-historical interest are chiefly <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ("Acta martyrum et sanctorum", ed. Bedjan, Paris, 1890-). The "Chronicle of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>", based on ancient sources, was written in the sixth century (ed. Assemani, "Bibliotheca orientalis", I, 394). In the same century the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/08470c.htm">John of Ephesus</a>, wrote a history of the Church, but only its third part (571 to 586) is preserved (ed. Cureton, Oxford, 1853; tr., Oxford, 1860). Lengthy extracts from the second part are found in the annals of Dionysius of Telmera. His work covers the years 583-843 (fragments in Assemani, "Bibliotheca orientalis", II, 72 sqq.). Among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> we meet with versions of Greek and Syriac works. The most important native <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> chronicle of an ecclesiastico-historical character is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/10598a.htm">Moses of Chorene</a>, an historical personage of the fifth century. The author of the "History of Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>" calls himself <a href="../cathen/10598a.htm">Moses of Chorene</a>, and claims to have lived in the fifth century and to have been a disciple of the famous St. Mesrop (q.v.). The self-testimony of the compiler must be rejected, since the work makes use of sources of the sixth and seventh centuries, and there is no trace of it to be found in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> literature before the ninth century. Probably, therefore, it originated about the eighth century. In the known <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the work contains three parts: the "Genealogy of Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>" extends to the dynasty of the <a href="../cathen/01753f.htm">Arsacides</a>, the "Middle Period of our Ancestry" to the death of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a>, and the "End of the History of our Country" to the downfall of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/01753f.htm">Arsacides</a> (ed. Amsterdam, 1695; Venice, 1881; French translation in Langlois, "Collection des historiens anciens et modernes de l'Arm&eacute;nie", 2 vols., Paris, 1867-9). In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there was still extant a fourth part. The work seems to be on the whole reliable. The ancient history, down to the second or third century after Christ, is based on popular legends. Another <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> historian is <a href="../cathen/05387a.htm">St. Elish&eacute;</a>.

<p>Comprehensive ecclesiastico-historical works appear in the Latin West later than in the Greek East. The first beginnings of historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> are confined to translations with additions. Thus <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> translated the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle" of Eusebius</a> and continued it down to 378. At the same time he opened up a special field, the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, in his <a href="../fathers/2708.htm">"De viris illustribus"</a>; ("Chronicon", ed. Schoene, 2 vols., Berlin, 1866-75; "De vir. ill.", ed. Richardson, Leipzig, 1896). About 400 the "Church History" of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> was translated by Rufinus who added the history of the Church from 318 to 395 in two new books (X and XI). Rufinus's continuation was itself soon translated into Greek. The latest edition is in the Berlin collection of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek Christian</a> writings mentioned above in connexion with <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> Latin recension of the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle" of Eusebius</a> was followed later by many other chronicles, among which may be mentioned the works of Prosper, Idacius, Marcellinus, <a href="../cathen/15412a.htm">Victor of Tununum</a>, Marius of Avenches, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>. In the West, the first independent history of revelation and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was written by Sulpicius Severus, who published in 403 his "Historia (Chronica) Sacra" in two books; it reaches from the beginning of the world to about 400 (P.L., XX; ed. Hahn, Vienna, 1866). It is a short treatise and contains little historical information. A little later, Orosius wrote his "Historia adversus paganos" in seven books &#151; a universal history from the standpoint of the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">Christian apologist</a>. It begins with the deluge and comes down to 416. The purpose of Orosius was to refute the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> charge that the great misfortunes of the Roman Empire were due to the victory of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (P.L., XXXI; ed. Zangemeister, Vienna, 1882). With the same end in view, but with a far grander and loftier conception, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> wrote his famous <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"De civitate Dei"</a>, composed between 413 and 428, and issued in sections. It is an apologetic philosophy of history from the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. The work is important for church history on account of its numerous historical and arch&aelig;ological digressions (ed. Dombart, 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1877). About the middle of the sixth century, <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> caused the works of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, and Theodoret to be translated into Latin, and then amalgamated this version into one complete narrative under the title "Historia tripartita" (P.L., LXIX-LXX). Together with the works of Rufinus and Orosius, it was one of the principal sources from which through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Western peoples drew their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of early church history. Rich material for ecclesiastical history is also contained in the national histories of some Western peoples. Of the "History of the Goths", written by <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, we possess only an extract in Jordanis, "De origine actibusque Getarum" (ed. Mommsen in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Auct. antiquissimi", V., Berlin, 1882). Especially important is the "History of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>" in ten books by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, which reaches to 591 (ed. Arndt, "Mon. Germ. Hist: Scriptores rerum Meroving.", I, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, 1884-5). <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory</a> wrote also a "Liber de vit&acirc; Patrum", a work entitled "In glori&acirc; martyrum", and the book "De virtutibus (i.e. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>) S. Juliani" and "De virtutibus S. Martini" (ed. cit., pt. II, ad. Krusch). In the beginning of the seventh century <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> composed a "Chronicle of the West Goths" ("Historia de regibus Gothorum, Wandalorum, Suevorum", ed. Mommsen, "Chronica Minora", II, 241-303). Several other similar chronicles, from the fourth to the seventh century, were edited by Mommsen in the "Monumenta Germani&aelig; Historica: Auctores Antiquissimi" under the title of "Chronica Minora".
<h3 id="B">The Church historians of the second period</h3>

<p>The second period of church history, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, produced a copious historical literature, although it belongs rather to special than to general church history. Its works deal more often with particular nations, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>; general histories are rare. Moreover, owing to the dominant position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the Western peoples, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and profane history are in this epoch closely interwoven.

<p>In the East church history is almost completely identified with the history of the imperial court owing to the close relations of State and Church. For the same reason the Byzantine chronicles from Justinian the Great to the destruction of the empire in the middle of the fifteenth century contain much valuable information about the history of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. The most important of them are: the "Chronography of Theophanes Isaacius" (ed. de Boor, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1885); the "Chronicles" of <a href="../cathen/06463a.htm">Georgius Syncellus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06455a.htm">George Hamartolus</a>, Nicephorus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">John Malalas</a>, Procopius, Paulus Silentiarius, the works of <a href="../cathen/09174b.htm">Leo Diaconus</a>, Anna Comnena, <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a>, Georgius Cedrenus, to which we may add Nicetas Choniates, Georgius Pachymeres, Nicephorus Gregoras, and John Cantacuzenus. These Byzantine historical works were first published in a large collection at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1645-1711) under the title, "Byzantin&aelig; histori&aelig; Scriptores". A new edition, better and more complete, was executed by Niebuhr, Becker, Dindorf, and other collaborators in forty volumes (Bonn, 1828-78) under the title, "Corpus Scriptorum histori&aelig; Byzantin&aelig;". Most of these writings are also to be found in the Patrologia Gr&aelig;ca of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> church historian of the Byzantine period worthy of the name is Nicephorus Callistus, who flourished in the beginning of the fourteenth century.

<p>In Syriac we possess the aforesaid chronicle of Dionysius of Telmera. Towards the end of the twelfth century Michael Kandis, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> (died 1199), wrote a chronicle from the creation to 1196. It is an important source for the history of the Syriac Church after the sixth century, particularly for the history of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. This work has reached us in a thirteenth century <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version; a French translation was published by Langlois, "Chronique de Michel le Grand" (Venice, 1868). Another patriarch of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, Gregory Abulpharagius or <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Bar-Hebr&aelig;us</a>, Maphrian (i.e. <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>) of the Syro-Jacobite Church (1266-86), also wrote a universal chronicle in three parts. We must also mention the "Bibliotheca" (Myriobiblon) of Photius (died 891), in which about 280 authors are described and passages quoted from them (ed. Becker, Berlin, 1834), and the work "On Heresies" of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>.

<p>Throughout this period the West was furnishing abundant material for ecclesiastical history, but few genuinely historical works. Public life moved in narrow circles; a speculative tendency ruled in the centres of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity; consequently, ecclesiastico-historical works of a general character accorded ill with the spirit of the age, and during the whole period from the eighth to the fifteenth century the West offers only a few works of this class. In the ninth century, Haymo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt (died 853), undertook to write an ecclesiastical history of the first four centuries, taking Rufinus as his principal authority ("De christianarum rerum memori&acirc;", ed. Boxhorn, Leyden, 1650; P.L., CXVI). Subsequently with the aid of Latin versions of <a href="../cathen/06463a.htm">Georgius Syncellus</a>, Nicephorus, and especially of <a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">Theophanes</a>, to which he added his own material, the Roman Abbot Anastasius Bibliothecarius (the Librarian) wrote a "Church History" to the time of Leo the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, who died in 829 (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., CVIII). About the middle of the twelfth century, <a href="../cathen/11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Evroul in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, wrote an" Historia ecclesiastica" in thirteen books; it reaches to 1142, and is of especial value for the history of Normandy, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> (ed. A. Le Prevost, 5 vols., Paris, 1838-55). The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02316a.htm">Bartholomew of Lucca</a>, called also Ptolem&aelig;us de Fiadonibus (died 1327), covered a longer period. His work in twenty-four books reaches to 1313, and was continued to 1361 by Henry of Diessenhofen (ed. Muratori, "Scriptores Rerum Italicarum", XI). The "Flores chronicorum seu Catalogus Pontificum Romanorum" of Bernard Guidonis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve (died 1331), may be counted among the works on the general history of the Church (partially edited by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, "Spicilegium Romanum", VI; Muratori, op. cit., III; Bouquet, "Script. rer. gall.", XXI). The most extensive, and relatively the best, historical work during this period is the "Summa Historialis" of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>. It deals with profane and ecclesiastical history from the creation to 1457.

<p>The national histories which appeared towards the end of the last period (of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, Jordanis, <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>), were followed by similar works giving the history of other peoples. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> wrote his admirable "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", which describes in five books the history of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from the Roman conquest to 731, though treating principally of events after St. Augustine's mission in 596 (ed. Stevenson, London, 1838; ed. Hussey, Oxford, 1846). Paulus Warnefrid (Diaconus) wrote the history of his fellow-Lombards (Historia Langobardorum) from 568 to 733; it still remains the principal source for the history of his people. An unknown writer continued it to 774, and in the ninth century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Erchembert added the history of the Lombards of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a> to 889 (ed. Waitz in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script. rer. Langob. et Ital.", Hanover, 1877). Paulus wrote also a history of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> ("Gesta episcoporum Mettensium", ad. in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script.", II) and other historical works. The Scandinavian North found its ecclesiastical historian in <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a>; he covers the period between 788 and 1072, and his work is of special importance for the history of the Diocese of Hamburg-Bremen ("Gesta Hamburgensis ecclesi&aelig; Pontificum", ed. Lappenberg in "Mon. Germ. Hist: Script.", VII, 276 sqq.). <a href="../cathen/06105a.htm">Flodoard</a> (died 966) wrote the history of the <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Archdiocese of Reims</a> (Historia ecclesi&aelig; Remensis) to 948, a very important source for the history of the Church of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to that time ("Mon. Germ. Hist. Script.", XIII, 412 sqq.). The ecclesiastical history of Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was described by Albert Crantz, a canon of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (died 1517), in his "Metropolis" or "Historia de ecclesiis sub Carolo Magno in Saxoni&acirc; instauratis" (i.e. from 780 to 1504; Frankfort, 1576 and often reprinted). Among the special historical works of this period of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> we must mention the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, an important collection of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> biographies that take on larger proportions after the fourth century, are occasionally very lengthy in the eighth and ninth centuries, and through various continuations reach to the death of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> in 1431 (ed. Duchesne, 2 vols., Paris, 1886-92; ed. Mommsen, I, extending to 715, Berlin 1898). The German, Italian, French, and English chronicles, annals, and biographies of this epoch are very numerous. The more important authors of chronicles are: <a href="../cathen/12719c.htm">Regino of Pr&uuml;m</a>, <a href="../cathen/07266a.htm">Hermannus Contractus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08758a.htm">Lambert of Hersfeld</a>, <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freising</a>, <a href="../cathen/15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a>, Sigebert of Gemblours. The most important modern collections, in which the reader can find the chronicles and annals of the various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries, are the following: for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>: "Rerum Britannicarum medii &aelig;vi Scriptores, or Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain", I sqq. (London, 1858-); for <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>: "Collection de Chroniques belges", I sqq. (Brussels, 1836-); "Collection des chroniqueurs et trouv&egrave;res belges publ. par l'Acad&eacute;mie belge", I sqq. (Brussels, 1863-); "Recueil de chroniques publi&eacute; par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;mulation de Bruges" (56 vols., Bruges, 1839-64); for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>: Bouquet, "Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France" (Paris, 1738-; new ed. by L. Delisle, Paris, 1869-); for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>: "Monumenta Germ. historica: Scriptores", I sqq. (Hanover and Berlin, 1826-); for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>: Muratori, "Rerum Italicarum Scriptores pr&aelig;cipui" (25 vols., Milan, 1723-51); Idem, "Antiquitates Italic&aelig; medii &aelig;vi" (6 vols., Milan, 1738-42); for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>: Fl&oacute;rez, "Espa&ntilde;a sagrada" (51 vols., Madrid, 1747-1886); for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>: "Fontes rerum Austriacarum: Scriptores" (8 vols., Vienna, 1855-75); for <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>: Bielowski, "Monuments Poloni&aelig; historica" (2 vols., Lemberg, 1864-72; continued by the Academy of Cracow, III sqq., Cracow, 1878-); "Scriptores rerum polonicarum" (ibid., 1873-); for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden: Langebek, "Scriptores rerum Danicarum medii &aelig;vi" (9 vols., Copenhagen, 1772-8); Fant, "Scriptores rerum Suecicarum medii &aelig;vi" (3 vols., Upsala, 1818-76); Rietz, "Scriptores Suecici medii &aelig;vi" (3 vols., Lund, 1842). Other important collections are: L. d'Ach&eacute;ry, "Spidilegium veterum aliquot scriptorum" (13 vols., Paris, 1655); <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, "Acts Sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti" (9 vols., Paris, 1668); "Acts Sanctorum Bollandistarum" (see <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">BOLLANDISTS</a>). The best guide to the sources of medieval history is Potthast, "Bib. hist. medii &aelig;vi: Wegweiser durch die Geschichtswerke des europ&auml;ischen Mittelalters bis 1500" (Berlin, 1896).
<h3 id="C">The Church historians of the third period</h3>

<p>With the sixteenth century a new epoch dawned for ecclesiastical history. Under fresh and vigorous impulses it perfected its methods of investigation and narration, and assumed a daily more important place in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes. Historical criticism went hand in hand with the growth of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Henceforth, before their testimony was accepted, the sources of historical events were examined as to their authenticity. Increasing intimacy with the authors of Gr&aelig;co-Roman antiquity also of the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages, developed the historical sense. The religious controversies that followed the rise of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> were also an incentive to historical study. Printing made possible a rapid distribution of all kinds of writings, so that the sources of church history soon became known and studied in the widest circles, and new works on church history could be circulated in all directions. In this period also the development of church history may be considered in three divisions.

<h4 id="i">From the middle of the sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century</h4>

<p>The first large work on church history which appeared in this period was composed in the interests of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. Mathias Flacius, called <em>Illyricus</em> (a native of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>), united with five other <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> (John Wigand, Mathias Judex, Basilius Faber, Andreas Corvinus, and Thomas Holzschuher), to produce an extensive work, that should exhibit the history of the Church as a convincing apology for strict <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/03534b.htm">CENTURIATORS OF MAGDEBURG</a>.) In the "Centuri&aelig;", the institutions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> appear as works of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and darkness; naturally, therefore, we cannot expect from such writers any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> objective estimate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her development. The work called forth many refutations, the most able of which was written by Card. C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>. Urged by <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, he undertook in 1568 the task of producing an ecclesiastical history, which with astounding diligence he brought down to the end of the twelfth century and published under the title, "Annales ecclesiastici" (12 vols., Rome, 1588-1607). Numerous editions and continuations of it have appeared. (See <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">BARONIUS</a>.)

<h4 id="ii">From the middle of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century</h4>

<h5 id="i">Catholic Church historians</h5>

<p>From the middle of the seventeenth century French writers were active in ecclesiastico-historical research. The writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and other ancient sources were published in excellent editions, the auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of history were well cultivated. We are indebted to Antoine Godeau, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vence, for a "Histoire de l'&eacute;glise" reaching to the ninth century (5 vols., Paris, 1655-78; several other editions have appeared and the work was translated into Italian and German), and to the Oratorian <a href="../cathen/03126a.htm">Cabassut</a> for "Historia ecclesiastica" (Lyons, 1685). Although the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09540a.htm">Louis Maimbourg</a> did not write a continuous ecclesiastical history, he published numerous treatises (Paris, 1673-83) on various important phases in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, Greek Schism, struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the emperors, <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>). Among the great ecclesiastical historians of this period, whose works have a permanent value, three names stand out prominently. The first is <a href="../cathen/01296c.htm">No&euml;l Alexandre (Natalis Alexander)</a> a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. The second is Claude Fleury, who, in the interest especially of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> readers, wrote a "Histoire eccl&eacute;siastique" in 20 volumes, reaching to 1414 (Paris, 1691-1720). He adopts throughout an attitude of moderate Gallicanism (see FLEURY). The third, one of the greatest church historians of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, is <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Louis Sebasti&egrave;n le Nain de Tillemont</a>. To these must be added the great <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, who, in his "Discours sur l'histoire universelle" (Paris, 1681), treated in masterly fashion the history of the Church as far as <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy of history found in him an exponent of sublime genius. His "Histoire des variations des &eacute;glises protestantes" (2 vols., Paris, 1688) describes the changes which the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclifites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, made in the fundamental doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. These French church historians of the seventeenth century are far superior to their successors in the eighteenth. Several French writers, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, produced elegant narratives, if we consider only external form, but they do compare unfavourably with their predecessors in criticism of their sources and in scientific accuracy. The following are noteworthy: Fran&ccedil;ois Timol&eacute;on de Choisy, "Histoire de l'&Eacute;glise" (11 vols., Paris, 1706-23); Bonaventure Racine (<a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>), "Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de l'histoire ecclesiastique" (13 vols., <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, properly <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1762-7); Gabriel Ducreux, "Les si&egrave;cles chr&eacute;tiens" (9 vols., Paris, 1775; 2nd ad. in 10 vols., Paris, 1783). The widest circulation was attained by the "Histoire de l'&Eacute;glise" of <a href="../cathen/02486a.htm">B&eacute;rault-Bercastel</a>.

<p>Next to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during this period produced the greatest number of excellent church historians, chiefly, however, in <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a> and special departments of history. The well-known names of Cardinals <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Noris</a>, <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Bona</a>, and Pallavicini, Archbishop Mansi of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, the Vatican librarian Zacagni, the learned <a href="../cathen/15119b.htm">Ughelli</a>, Roncaglia, <a href="../cathen/02541b.htm">Bianchini</a>, Muratori, the brothers <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Pietro and Girolamo Ballerini</a>, <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, and Zaccaria, are enough to indicate the character and extent of historical research carried on in the Italian peninsula during the eighteenth century. Among the general histories of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we may mention the "Storia Ecclesiastica" of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Giuseppe Agostino Orsi</a>. A church history of similarly vast proportions was undertaken by the Oratorian Sacarelli. A third work, of an even more comprehensive nature and reaching to the beginning of the eighteenth century, was written by the French <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Hyacinthe Graveson, resident in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, "Historia ecclesiastica variis colloquia digesta" (12 vols., Rome, 1717-). Mansi continued it in two volumes to 1760. Compendia of general church history, widely read even outside <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, were written by the Augustinian Lorenzo Berti ("Breviarium histori&aelig; ecclesiastic&aelig;", <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 1761-8), to whom we are also indebted for three volumes of "Dissertationes historic&aelig;" (Florence, 1753-6); Carlo Sigonio, who treated the first three centuries (2 vols., Milan, 1758), and Giuseppe Zola, who treats the same period in his "Commentarium de rebus ecclesiasticis" (3 vols., Pavia, 1780-), and who also wrote "Prolegomena comment. de rebus eccl." (ibid., 1779).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, general church history found no representatives among the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers of the eighteenth century. On the other hand, the Augustinian Enrique Fl&oacute;rez began at this period a monumental work on the ecclesiastical history of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the famous "Espa&ntilde;a sagrada", which at the death of the author in 1773 had reached its twenty-ninth volume. Manuel Risco continued it to the forty-second volume, and, since his death, it has been carried still nearer to completion, the fifty-first volume appearing in 1886. The other countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> also failed to produce original works on the general history of the Church. The conditions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> about this time were too unfavourable to permit the undertaking of extensive scientific histories. Some masterly special works appeared in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, monographs of particular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but general church history was not cultivated until <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> had executed his reform of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. Even then there appeared only small works, mostly excerpted from the great French <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> histories, superficial, Josephinistic in temper, and hostile to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among them are <a href="../cathen/09431b.htm">Lumper's</a> "Institutiones histori&aelig; ecclesiastic&aelig;" (Vienna, 1790); the "Institutiones histori&aelig; eccl." of Dannenmeyer (2 vols., Vienna, 1788), relatively the best; the "Synopsis histor. relig. et eccles. christ." of Royko (Prague, 1785); the "Epitome hist. eccl." of Gmeiner (2 vols., Gratz, 1787-1803), and similar works by Wolf, Schmalzfuss, St&ouml;ger, Becker, all of them now utterly valueless. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> also produced only compendia, e.g. those of Mutsaerts (2 vols., Antwerp, 1822), Rosweyde (2 vols., Antwerp, 1622), M. Chefneux ("Eccl. Cathol. speculum chronographicum", 3 vols., Li&egrave;ge, 1666-70). Needless to add, in Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the sad condition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> made scientific work impossible.

<h5 id="ii">Protestant Church historians</h5>

<p>It was long after the publication of the "Magdeburg Centuries" (see above) before <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars again undertook extensive independent work in the province of church history. Their momentous division into Reformed and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> on the one hand, and the domestic feuds among the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> on the other, engrossed the minds of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. When <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholarship again busied itself with ecclesiastico-historical research, the Reformed Churches took the lead and retained it into the eighteenth century. This was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> not only in the domain of special history, in which they issued important publications (e.g. Bingham's "Antiquitates ecclesiastic&aelig;", 1722; the works of Grabe, Beveridge, Blondel, Daill&eacute;, Saumaise, Usher, Pearson, Dodwell, etc.), but also in that of general church history. Among their writers on this subject we must mention Hottinger, whose "Historia ecclesiastica Novi Test." (9 vols., Hanover, 1655-67) is filled with bitter <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; Jacques Basnage, the opponent of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> ("Histoire de l'&Eacute;glise depuis J&eacute;sus-Christ jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent", Rotterdam, 1699); Samuel Basnage, the opponent of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> ("Annales politico-eccles." 3 vols., Rotterdam, 1706), and Spanheim ("Introductio ad hist. et antiquit. sacr.", Leyden, 1687; "Historia ecclesiastica", ibid., 1701). The Reformed Churches produced moreover a number of manuals of church history, e.g. Turettini, "Hist. eccles. compendium" (Halle, 1750); Venema, "Institut. histor. eccl." (5 vols., Leyden, 1777); Jablonski, "Institut. hist. eccl." (2 vols., Frankfort, 1753). Similar <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> manuals appeared in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner</a>, "History of the Church of Christ" (4 vols., London, 1794); Murray, "History of Religion" (4 vols., London, 1794), and Priestley, "History of the Christian Church".

<p>During the seventeenth century, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> produced little of value in the field of church history, other than a much used "Compendium histor. eccl." by Seckendorf and Bockler (Gotha, 1670-6). But a new era in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> historiography dates from Arnold's "Unparteiische Kirchen- und Ketzerhistorie" (2 vols., Frankfort am M., 1699). This pietist author is friendly to all the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, but bitterly inimical to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. His standard is neither <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> nor Scripture, but subjective "interior light". Calmer judgment is found in Eberhard Weissmann's "Introductio in memorabilia ecclesiastica histori&aelig; sacr&aelig; Novi Test." (2 vols., T&uuml;bingen, 1718). Superior to the works of all preceding <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> writers, both because of their thoroughness and their dignified diction, are the Latin historical writings of Joh. Lor. Mosheim, particularly his "De rebus christ. ante Constantinum Magnum" (Helmstadt, 1753), and "Institutiones histor. eccles. antiquioris et recentioris" (ibid., 1755). They betray, however, a tendency towards a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> concept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which appears throughout as an institution of secular origin. His "Institutiones" were translated into German and continued by two of his pupils, J. von Einem and Rud. Schlegel (Leipzig, 1769-; Heilbronn, 1770-). Further progress was made in the works of Pfaff, chancellor of T&uuml;bingen ("Institutiones histor. eccl.", T&uuml;bingen, 1721), of Baumgarten ("Auszug der Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Halle, 1743-), Pertsch ("Versuch einer Kirchengeschichte", 5 vols, Leipzig, 1736-), Cotta ("Versuch einer ausf&uuml;hrlichen Kirchenhistorie des neuen Testamentes", 3 vols., T&uuml;bingen, 1768-73). Special works, excellent for their time, were written by the two Walchs&mdash;Joh. Georg Walch issuing "Eine Geschichte der Reigionsstreitigkeiten innerhalb und ausserhalb der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche" in two parts, each comprising five volumes (Jena, 1733-9) while his son Christian Wilhelm published a lengthy "ketzergeschichte", whose eleventh volume reaches to the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a> (Leipzig, 1762-85). The latter also wrote a "Religionsgeschichte der neuesten Zeit", beginning with <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> (to which Planck added three volumes) also a "Historie der Kirchenversammlungen" (Leipzig, 1759), and a "Historic der r&ouml;m. P&auml;pste" (G&ouml;ttingen, 1758). The most important <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> work on general church history is that of J. Mathias Schr&ouml;ckh, a pupil of Mosheim and a professor at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>: "Christliche Kirchengeschichte bis zur <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>" in thirty-five volumes (Leipzig, 1768-1803), continued as "Kirchengeschichte seit der Reformation" in eight volumes (Leipzig, 1803-8), to which Tzschirmer added two others (1810-12). The whole work, scholarly but too diffuse and laying excessive emphasis on the biographical element, includes forty-five volumes and closes with the beginning of the nineteenth century. Meanwhile the shallow <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> of the eighteenth century had spread widely, and soon affected many works on church history. The works of Joh. Salomon Seniler, an unbelieving hypercritic, in this respect hold an undesirable pre-eminence, his "Histori&aelig; eccles. selecta capita" (3 vols., Halle 1767-), "Versuch eines fruchtbaren Auszuges der kirchengeschichte" (3 parts, ibid., 1778), and "Versuch christlicher Jahrb&uuml;cber" (2 parts, Halle, 1782). Most of his contemporaries were more or less openly <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a>, and church history became a chronicle of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> (Scandalchronik). Everywhere the writers saw only <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, fanaticism, and human passion, while the greatest and holiest characters of ecclesiastical history were shamefully caricatured. This spirit is particularly characteristic of Spittler, "Grundriss der Gesch. der christl. Kirche" and Henke "Allgem. Geschichte der chr. K."

<h4 id="iii">The nineteenth century</h4>

<p>Ecclesiastico-historical studies have fared better in the nineteenth century. The horrors of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> led to a vigorous reaction and gave birth to a more ideal spirit in literature. Patriotism and religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> revived and exerted a favourable influence on all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life. Romanticism led to a juster appreciation of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Catholic medieval world</a>, while in all departments of learning there appeared an earnest desire to be objective in judgment. Finally, the sources of ecclesiastical history were studied and used in a new spirit, the outgrowth of an ever more definite and penetrating historical criticism. The general result was favourable to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history.

<h5>Catholic historians in Germany</h5>

<p>It was in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> that these changes were first noticeable, more particularly in the work of the famous convert, <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Count Leopold von Stolberg</a>. His "Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi" was issued in fifteen volumes, the first four of which contain the history of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and reach to 430. Similarly, the less important "Geschichte der christlichen Kirche" (9 vols., Ravensburg, 1824-34) by Locherer, rather uncritical and exhibiting the influence of Schr&ouml;ckh, remained unfinished, and reaches only to 1073. The excellent "Geschichte der christlichen Kirche" by J. Othmar von Rauschen is also incomplete. A useful compendium, serious and scientific in character, was begun by Hortig, professor at Landshut, the "Handbuch der christlichen Kirchengeschichte". He completed two volumes (Landshut, 1821-), and reached the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; a third volume, that brought the work down to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolution</a>, was added by his successor <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. This scholar, who unhappily later on abandoned the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> attitude and principles of his earlier days, excelled all previous writers of this century. Johann Adam M&ouml;hler wrote several special historical works and dissertations of exceptional merit. His lectures on general church history were published after his death by his pupil, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Pius Gams</a> ("Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Ratisbon, 1867). To these larger and epoch-making works must be added several compendia, some of which like Klein ("Historia ecclesiastica", Gratz, 1827), Ruttenstock ("Institutiones hist. eccl.", 3 vols., Vienna, 1832-4), Cherrier ("Instit. hist. eccl.", 4 vols., Pestini, 1840&mdash;), were bare summaries of facts; others, like <a href="../cathen/13088a.htm">Ritter</a> ("Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Bonn, 1830; 6th ed. by Ennen, 1861), and <a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a> ("Universalgeschichte der christlichen Kirche", Mains, 1840; 10th ed. by F. X. Kraus, 1882), are lengthy narratives, critical and thorough. Particular periods or epochs of ecclesiastical history soon found careful cultivation, e.g. by <a href="../cathen/13054c.htm">Riffel</a>, "Kirchengeschichte der neuen und neuesten Zeit, vom Anfang der Glaubensspaltung im 16. Jahrhundert" (3 vols., Mainz, 1841-6); <a href="../cathen/04614b.htm">Damberger</a>, "Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirche und der Welt im Mittelalter" (in 15 volumes, Ratisbon, 1850-63; the last volume edited by Rattinger), which reaches to 1378. With <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> and M&ouml;hler we must rank Karl Joseph Hefele, the third of the great German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historians, whose valuable "Konziliengeschichte" is really a comprehensive work on general church history;. the first seven volumes of the work (Freiburg, 1855-74) reach to 1448. A new edition was begun by the author (ibid., 1873-); it was carried on by Kn&ouml;pfler (vole. V-VII), while <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) undertook to continue the work and published two more volumes (VIII-IX, 1887-90); which carry the history of the Councils to the opening of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> is the fourth great church historian of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. His "Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte" (3 vols., Freiburg im B., 1876-80; 3rd ed., 1884-6; 4th ed., revised by J. P. Kirsch, 1902 sqq.) exhibits vast erudition and won recognition, even from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as the most independent and instructive <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> history. In recent years smaller, but scholarly compendia have been written by <a href="../cathen/03004a.htm">Br&uuml;ck</a>, Krause Funk, Kn&ouml;pfler, Marx, and Weiss. Numerous periodicals of a scientific nature bear evidence to the vigorous activity at present displayed in the field of ecclesiastical history, e.g. the "Kirchengeschichtliche Studien" (M&uuml;nster), the "Quellen und Forschungen aus dem Gebiet der Geschichte" (Paderborn), the "Forschungen zur christlichen Literatur- und Dogmengeschichte" (Mainz and Paderborn), the "Ver&ouml;ffentlichungen aus dem kirchenhistorischen Seminar M&uuml;nchen".

<h5>Catholic historians in France</h5>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the study of church history was long in attaining the high standard it reached in the seventeenth century. Two extensive narratives of general church history appeared. That of <a href="../cathen/13117c.htm">Rohrbacher</a> is the better, "Histoire universelle de l'&Eacute;glise catholique" (Nancy, 1842-9). It exhibits little independent research, but is a diligently executed work, and the author made a generous and skilful use of the best and most recent literature (new ed. with continuation by Guillaume, Paris, 1877). The second work is by <a href="../cathen/04636a.htm">Darras</a>. In recent years the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of ecclesiastical history has made great progress in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, both as to genuine criticism and thorough scholarly narrative. The critical tendency, aroused and sustained principally by Louis Duchesne, continues to flourish and inspires very important works, particularly in special ecclesiastical history. Among the writings of Duchesne the "Histoire ancienne de l'&Eacute;glise" (2 vols., already issued, Paris, 1906-) deserves particular mention. Another important publication is the "Biblioth&egrave;que de l'enseignement de l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique" a series of monographs by different authors, of which fourteen volumes have so far appeared (Paris, 1896-), and some have gone through several editions. A very useful manual is Marion's "Histoire de l'&Eacute;glise" (Paris, 1906).

<h5>Catholic historians in Belgium</h5>

<p>Belgium, the home of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> and seat of the great work of the "Acta Sanctorum", deserves particular credit for the truly scientific spirit in which that noble work is conducted. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> de Smedt wrote an excellent "Introductio generalis in Historiam ecclesiasticam critice tractandam" (Louvain, 1876). A manual of church history was published by <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouters</a> ("Compendium hist. eccl.", 3 vols., Louvain, 1874), who also wrote "Dissertationes in selecta capita hist. eccl." (6 vols. <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 1868-72). <a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Jungmann</a> dealt with general church history to the end of the eighteenth century in his "Dissertationes select&aelig; in historiam ecclesiasticam". The serious character of ecclesiastico-historical studies at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> is best seen in the "Revue d'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique" edited by Cauchie and Ladeuze.

<h5>Catholic historians in Italy</h5>

<p>Some good manuals have appeared in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> which evidence a beginning of serious studies in church history, e.g. Delsignore, "Institutiones histor. eccles.", edited by Tissani (4 vols., Rome, 1837-46); Palma, "Pr&aelig;lectiones hist. eccl." (4 vols., Rome, 1838-46); Prezziner, Storia della Chiesa (9 vols., Florence, 1822-); Ign. Mozzoni, "Prolegomena alla storia universale della chiesa" (Florence, 1861), and "Tavole chronologiche critiche della storia universale della chiesa" (Venice 1856-). Balan published as a continuation of <a href="../cathen/13117c.htm">Rohrbacher's</a> universal ecclesiastical history the "Storia della chiesa dall' anno 1846 sino ai giorni nostri" (3 vols., Turin, 1886). Special works of great value were produced in various departments, above all by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">Giovanni Battista de Rossi</a> in <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a>. However, certain recent works on general church history &#151; e.g. Amelli, "Storia della chiesa" (2 vols., Milan, 1877); Taglialatel&aacute;, "Lezioni di storia eccles. e di archeologia cristiana" (4 vols., Naples, 1897); Pighi, "Inst. hist. eccl.", I (Verona, 1901) &#151; do not come up to the present standard, at any rate, from the standpoint of methodical and critical treatment.

<h5>Catholic historians in Spain</h5>

<p>The ecclesiastical history of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> inspired two great works, one by Villanueva ("Viage literario a las iglesias de Espa&ntilde;a", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1803-21; 1850-2), the other by de la Fuente ("Historia ecclesiastica de Espa&ntilde;a", 2nd ed., 2 vols., Madrid, 1873-5). In the field of general history, only Amat's "Historia ecclesiastica o tratado de la Iglesia de Jesu Christo" (12 vols., Madrid, 1793-1803, 2nd ed. 1807) appeared &#151; not a very thorough work. Juan Manuel de Berriozobal wrote "Historia de la Iglesia en sus primos siglos" (4 vols., Madrid, 1867). The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Francisco Rivaz y Madrazo published a manual ("Curso de historia ecclesiastica", 3 vols., 3rd ed., Madrid, 1905).

<h5>Catholic historians in Holland</h5>

<p>The first scientific <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> manual of church history in Dutch was recently written by Albers ("Handboek der algemeene Kerkgeschiedenis", 2 vols., Nijmegen, 1905-7; 2nd ed., 1908).

<h5>Catholic historians in England</h5>

<p>In English-speaking lands general church history has hitherto been but little cultivated; special ecclesiastical history, on the other hand, can point to a multitude of works. Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> productions may be noted <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard's</a> "History of England" and his "History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church", which are reliable works of reference for early and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> ecclesiastical history; Butler's "Historical Memoirs of English, Irish and Scottish Catholics since the Reform" (London, 1819; with <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner's</a> "Supplementary Memoirs", ibid., 1820); <a href="../cathen/06094a.htm">Flanagan's</a> "History of the Church of England" (2 vols., London, 1850); Reeve's "Short View of the History of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". The post-Reformation period is treated in <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a>, "Church History of England, 1500-1688" (ed. <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>, 5 vols., London, 1839). Other useful works are Gillow's "Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics since the Reformation", <a href="../cathen/01323b.htm">Allies'</a> "The Formation of Christendom", Digby's "Mores Catholici, or Ages of Faith" (q.v.)

<h5>Catholic historians in Scotland</h5>

<p>A brief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> general account of the history of the Church in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> is that of T. Walsh, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland" (1876). An excellent history is that of Canon Bellesheim, with a very full bibliography, translated into English by Dam Hunter-Blair, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland" (4 vols., London, 1887, sqq.). The ablest non-Catholic work is Calderwood's "History of the Kirk" (8 vols., Edinburgh, 1842).

<h5>Catholic historians in Ireland</h5>

<p>The numerous civil histories of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> abound in materials for its church history. The first serious <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> work on the general ecclesiastical history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was that of <a href="../cathen/16051a.htm">Lanigan</a>, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (4 vols., 2nd ed., Dublin, 1829), reaching only to the beginning of the thirteenth century. A single volume work is that of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/02758b.htm">Brenan</a>, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (Dublin, 1864). Important works dealing with particular epochs and aspects of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> history: Haddan and Stubbs, "Councils and Eccl. Documents relating to Great Britain and Ireland" (non-Catholic, London, 1873); W. Mazi&egrave;re-Brady, "The Episcopal Succession in England, Scotland and Ireland, 1400-1873" (Rome, 1876); Ware and Harris, "History of the Bishops, Antiquities, and Writers of Ireland" (non-Catholic, 3 vols., Dublin, 1739-1845); Malone, "Church History of Ireland from the Anglo-Norman Invasion to the Reformation" (Dublin, 1882); <a href="../cathen/11224d.htm">O'Hanlon's</a> "Lives of the Irish Saints"; Killen, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (Presbyterian, London, 1875). Good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> accounts of the early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church are those of <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a> (Freiburg, 1867), Moran (Dublin, 1864), Gargan (ibid., 1864), Salmon (ibid., 1900). <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> views were set forth by Stokes, "Ireland and the Celtic Church to 1172" (London, 1886), Loofs (1882), and Zimmer (1907). For a good bibliography of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> ecclesiastical history see Bellesheim, "Gesch. der kathol. Kirche in Irland" (3 vols., Mains, 1890-).

<h5>Catholic historians in the United States</h5>

<p>No satisfactory general history of the Church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has yet appeared. A very learned documentary work is that of John Gilmary Shea, "History of the Catholic Church in the United States" (4 vols., New York, 1886). O'Gorman's, "A History of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States" (New York, 1895), contains a useful bibliography.

<p>For Australia see Cardinal Moran's "History of the Catholic Church in Australasia" (Sydney, 1896).

<h5>Protestant historians</h5>

<p>Among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, Church history was cultivated chiefly by German <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>; their works came to be authoritative among non-Catholics. Planck, the first important <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> ecclesiastical historian of the nineteenth century, exhibits the influence of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> of the preceding age, but exhibits also more solidity and more <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiment both in his special works on the history of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and in his important "Geschichte der christlichkirchlichen Gesellschaftsverfassung" (5 vols., Hanover, 1803-9). Neander is superior to him in talents and erudition, and moreover retains <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. His "Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche" (5 vols., Hamburg, 1825-45) reaches to the end of the thirteenth century; after his death a sixth volume (to the Council of Basle) was added (1852). He also wrote a history of the Apostolic epoch, "Geschichte der Pflanzung und Leitung der christlichen Kirche durch die Apostel" (2 vols., Hamburg, 1832-). To his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> belong Guericke ("Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Halle, 1833; 9th ed., Leipzig, 1865-), Jacobi ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Berlin, 1850), Schaff ("Geschichte der alten Kirche", Leipzig, 1867), Niedner ("Gesch. der christl. Kirche", Leipzig, 1846). They are stricter <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> however. A different method is followed by <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 2 vols., Jena, 1818-26); the text is brief and condensed, but is fortified by lengthy excerpts from the sources. A similar plan is followed by Gieseler ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", 5 vols., Bonn, 1824-57; a sixth volume was added by Redepenning from the author's <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>). Other manuals were written by Engelhardt (3 vols., Erlangen, 1832, with a volume of sources, 1834) and Kurtz ("Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", Mitau, 1849). Lindner's "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" (3 vols., Leipzig, 1848-54) is strictly <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>; less biased are Hasse ("Kirchengeschichte", 3 parts, Leipzig, 1864) and Herzog ("Abriss der gesammten Kirchengeschichte", 3 vols., Erlangen, 1876, sq.). Hase's "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" and "Kirchengeschichte" are moderate in views, though frankly anti-Catholic. His diction is elegant, and his character-sketches finely drawn.

<p>Another <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is more in sympathy with Semler's <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> views. These writers are <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> in temper and spirit and seek to strip <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of its <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character. Its first leaders were the so-called "Neo-T&uuml;bingen School" under Johann Christian Baur, whose ecclesiastico-historical writings are directly anti-Christian: "Das Christentum und die Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte" (T&uuml;bingen, 1853); "Die christliche Kirche vom 4. bis zum 6. Jahrhundert" (ibid., 1859); "Die christliche Kirche des Mittelalters" (ibid., 1860); "Die neuere Zeit" (ibid., 1861-3); "Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert" (ibid., 1863-73). Baur himself and his <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> adherents, Schwegler, Rits&ccedil;hl, <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">Rothe</a>, wrote also special works on the origins of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The "Allgemeine Kirchengeschichte" of <a href="../cathen/06542a.htm">Gfr&ouml;rer</a> (7 parts, Stuttgart, 1841), written prior to his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, is a product of this spirit. Though constantly attacked, this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, whose chief living representative is Adolf Harnack, predominates in German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Moeller, in his able "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" writes with moderation; similarly M&uuml;ller in his yet unfinished "Kirchengeschichte" (T&uuml;bingen, 1892, sqq.).

<p>In the nineteenth century also the Reformed (see above) produced less in the province of general church history than the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. Among the German authors must be named: Thym, "Historische Entwicklung der Schicks&auml;le der Kirche Christi" (2 vols., Berlin, 1800&mdash;); Munscher, "Lehrbuch der christl. Kirchengeschichte" (Marburg, 1801); Ebrard, "Handbuch der Kirchen- und Dogmengeschichte" (4 vols., Erlangen, 1865-); the most important of the Reformed Church historians is Hagenbach, "Kirchengeschichte" who is temperate in his criticism of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Catholic Middle Ages</a>. Among the Reformed Church historians of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> must be mentioned: Matter, "Histoire du christianisme et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; chr&eacute;tienne" (4 vols., Strasburg, 1829); Potter "Histoire du christianisme" (8 vols., Paris, 1856); Et. Chastel, "Histoire du christianisme depuis son origine jusqu'&agrave; nos jours" (5 vols., Paris, 1881-3); Pressens&eacute;, "Histoire des trois premiers si&egrave;cles"; d'Aubign&eacute;, "Histoire de la reformation du 16<sup>me</sup> si&egrave;cle" (Paris, 1831-). <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> produced: Hofstede de Groot, "Institutiones histor. eccles." (Groningen, 1835); Royaards, "Compendium hist. eccl. christ." (Utrecht, 1841-45).

<p>In the past, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and North America have cultivated for the most part special fields, especially the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> period and the ecclesiastical history of particular nations. The most important general ecclesiastical history of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> hitherto produced by <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> scholars is that edited by W. Stephens and W. Hunt &#151; "A History of the English Church" by various writers (Hunt, Stephens, Capes, Gairdner, Hutton, Overton), of which ten volumes have already (1910) appeared. An exhaustive history of the period since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> is that of Dixon, "History of the Church of England since 1529" (5 vols., 1878-1902). In his "Lollardy and the Reformation in England" (2 vols., London, 1908), Dr. James Gairdner gives an able and impartial account of the genesis of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A very useful work is the "Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines during the first eight centuries", edited by. William Smith and H. Wace (4 vols., London, 1879-). We might also mention the "History of the Christian Church" by Canon James Robertson of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, reaching to 1517; C. Wordsworth's "Church History" (4 vols., London, 1885), and the "History of the Christian Church" by Schaff (6 vols., New York, 1882-1909). Other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> histories are: Archdeacon Hardwick's "History of the Christian Church, Middle Age" (3rd ed. by Stubbs, London, 1872), and "Reformation" (3rd ed. by Stubbs, London, 1873); French's "Lectures on Medieval Church History" (London, 1877); Milman's "History of Latin Christianity to Nicholas V, 1455" (revised ed., London, 1866); Philip Smith's "History of the Christian Church to the end of the Middle Ages" (New York, 1885); George P. Fisher's "History of the Christian Church" (New York, 1887). Fair and impartial in many ways is Wakeman's "Introduction to the Church History of England" (3rd ed., London, 1907). To these may be added James Murdock's translation of Mosheim's "Institutes" (New York, 1854), and Henry B. Smith's translation of Gieseler's "History of the Church" (New York, 1857-80). For the sources of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> Church history in general see Gross, "The Sources of English History to 1489" (New York, 1900), and Gardiner and Mullinger, "Introduction to the Study of English History" (latest ed., London, 1903).

<h5>Greek Orthodox historians</h5>

<p>In recent time Greek Orthodox writers have produced two works which indicate a growing interest in general Church history: the <em>Historia Ekklesiastike</em> by Diomedes Kyriakus (2 vols., Athens, 1882), and the <em>Ekklesiastike historia apo Iesou Christou mechri ton kath hemas chronon</em> by Philaretes Bapheides (Constantinople, 1884-).

<p>In conclusion it may be added that the biographies of most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors mentioned above will be found in <a href="../cathen/index.html">THE CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA</a>.
