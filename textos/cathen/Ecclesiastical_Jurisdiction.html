<h1>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to guide and rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. The subject is here treated under the following heads:

<blockquote><p>I. General Concept and Classification of Jurisdiction; <br>II. Development of Jurisdiction in its strict sense; <br>III. Present Scope of Jurisdiction in its strict sense.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">General concept and classification of jurisdiction</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by Christ for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men needs, like every <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, a regulating power (the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>). This power Christ has bestowed upon it. Directly before His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> He gave to the Apostles collectively the commission, and with it the authority, to proclaim his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to all nations, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them, and to teach them to observe all things that He had commanded (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs18">Matthew 28:18 sqq.</a>). It may be noted here that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili sane", of 3 July, 1907, rejects (n. 52 sqq.) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that Christ did not desire to found a permanent, unchangeable Church endowed with authority. It is customary to speak of a threefold office of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">office of teaching</a> (prophetic office), the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, and the pastoral office (governing office), also, therefore, of the threefold authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is, the <em>teaching</em> authority, <em>ministerial</em> authority, and <em>ruling</em> authority. Since, however, the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is authoritative, the teaching authority is traditionally included in the ruling authority; regularly, therefore, only the ministerial authority and the ruling authority are distinguished. By ministerial authority, which is conferred by an act of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, is meant the inward, and, because of its indelible character, permanent capacity to perform acts by which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> is transmitted. By ruling authority, which is conferred by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>missio canonica</em>, canonical mission), is understood the authority to guide and rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. Jurisdiction, in so far as it covers the relations of man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is called <em>jurisdiction of the internal forum</em> or jurisdiction of the forum of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> (<em>jurisdictio poli</em>). (See <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">E<font size=-2>CCLESIASTICAL</font> F<font size=-2>ORUM</font></a>.) This again is either <em>sacramental</em> or <em>penitential</em>, so far as it is used in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, or extra-sacramental, e.g. in granting <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from private <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Jurisdiction, in so far as it regulates external <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relations, is called jurisdiction of the external forum, or briefly <em>jurisdictio fori</em>. This jurisdiction, the actual power of ruling is <em>legislative, judicial</em>, or <em>coactive</em>. Jurisdiction can be possessed in varying degrees. It can also be held either for both fora, or for the internal forum only, e.g. by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Jurisdiction can be further sub-divided into: <em>ordinary, quasi-ordinary</em>, and <em>delegated jurisdiction</em>. Ordinary jurisdiction is that which is permanently bound, by Divine or human law, with a permanent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office. Its possessor is called an ordinary judge. By <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has such ordinary jurisdiction for the entire Church and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. By human law this jurisdiction is possessed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, officials of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the congregations of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, the <em>praelati nullius</em>, and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> with quasi-epsicopal jurisdiction, the chapters of orders, or, respectively, the heads of orders, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters in reference to their own affairs, the archdiaconate in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the internal forum. If, however, jurisdiction is permanently connected with an office, but the office itself is said to be quasi-ordinary, or <em>jurisdictio vicaria</em>. This form of jurisdiction is possessed, for example, by a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Temporary exercise of ordinary and quasi-ordinary jurisdiction can be granted, in varying degrees, to another as representative, without conferring on him an office properly so called. In this transient form jurisdiction is called <em>delegated</em> or <em>extraordinary</em>, and concerning it canon law, following the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, has developed exhaustive provisions. This development began when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially since <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-81), found themselves <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, by the enormous mass of legal business which came to them from all sides as the <em>"judices ordinarii omnium"</em> to hand over, with proper instruction, a large number of cases to third parties for decision, especially in matters of contentious jurisdiction.

<p>Delegated jurisdiction rests either on a special authorization of the holders of ordinary jurisdiction (<em>delegatio ab homine</em>), or on a general law (<em>delegatio a lege, a jure, a canone</em>). Thus, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> transferred a number of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "tanquam Apostolicae Sedis delegati", i.e. also as delegates of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (Sess. VI, De ref., c. ii, iii, etc.), and "etiam tanquam Apostolicae Sedis delegati", i.e. also as delegates of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (Sess. VI, De ref., c. iv, etc.). In the first class of cases <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> do not possess ordinary jurisdiction. The meaning of the second expression is disputed, but it is generally taken as purely cumulative. If the delegation applies to one or several designated cases only, it is <em>special</em> delegation. If, however, it applies to an entire class of subjects, it is then <em>general</em> delegation or delegation for the universality of causes. Delegated jurisdiction for the total of a number of matters is known as <em>delegatio mandata</em>. Only those can be appointed delegates who are competent to execute the delegation. For an act of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the delegate must have himself the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a>. For acts of jurisdiction he must be an ecclesiastic, though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could also delegate a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Papal delegation is usually conferred only on ecclesiastical dignitaries or canons (c. xi, in VI&#176;, De <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>., I, iii; Council of Trent, Sess. XXV, De ref., c. x). The delegate must be twenty years old, but eighteen years suffices for one appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (c. xli, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix). He must also be free from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (c. xxiv, X, De sent. et re jud., II, xxvii). Those placed under the jurisdiction of the delegator must submit to the delegation (c. xxviii, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix). Delegation for one matter can also be conferred upon several. The distinction here to be made is whether they have to act jointly and severally (<em>collegiately</em>), jointly but individually (<em>solidarily</em>), or solidarily at least in some given case (c. xvi, xxi, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix; c. viii, in VI&#176;, h. t. I, xiv). The delegate is to follow exactly his instructions. He is, however, empowered to do all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to execute them (c. i, c, cii, ciii, xi, xxi, xxvi, xxviii, X, Xe off. jud. deleg., I, xxix). If he exceeds his power, his act is null (c. xxxvii, X, Xe off. jud. deleg., I, xxix). When <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> the delegate can himself delegate, i.e. subdelegate, a qualified <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; he can do this especially if he is a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate (c. iii, xxviii, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix), or if he has received permission, or if he has been delegated for a number of cases (Gloss to "Delegatus", c. lxii, X, De appell., II, xxviii). Since delegation constitutes a new court appeal can be taken from the delegate to the delegator, and in the case of subdelegation to the original delegator (c. xxvii, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix). Delegated jurisdiction expires on the death of the delegate, in case the commission were not issued in view of the permanence of his office, on the loss of office or the death of the delegator, in case the delegate has not acted (<em>re adhuc integra</em>, the matter being still intact), on recall of his authority by the delegator (even <em>re adhuc nondum integra</em>, the matter being no longer intact), on expiration of the allotted time, on settlement of the matter, on declaration of the delegate that he has no power (c. xiv, xix, iv, xxxviii, X, De off. jud. deleg., I, xxix).


<h2 id="section2">Development of jurisdiction in its strict sense</h2>

<p>The Church has the right, as a perfect and independent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> provided with all the means for attaining its end, to decide according to its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> disputes arising concerning its internal affairs, epecially as to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of its members, also to carry out its decision, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, by suitable means of compulsion, <em>contentious</em> or <em>civil</em> jurisdiction. It has, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to admonish or warn its members, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or lay, who have not conformed to its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and also, if needful to punish them by physical means, that is, <em>coercive</em> jurisdiction. The church has, first, the power to judge <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This it does in the internal forum. But a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> can be at the same time externally a misdemeanour or a crime (<em>delictum, crimen</em>), when threatened with external <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or civil punishment. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also judges <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> crimes in the external forum by infliction of penalties, except when the wrong doing has remained secret. In this case it contents itself, as a rule, with penance <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> assumed. Finally, another distinction is to be drawn between <em>necessary</em> jurisdiction and <em>voluntary</em> jurisdiction; the latter contemplates <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> subjection on the part of those who seek in legal matters the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> agencies, e.g. notarially executed instruments, testaments, etc. The judicial power described above, jurisdiction strictly so called, was given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and transmitted to their successors (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs15">Matthew 18:15 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs21">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs1">5:1 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs20">1 Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs19">5:19 sq.</a>).

<p>From the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> the <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, decided matters of dispute that were purely religious in character (<em>causae mere ecclesiasticae</em>). This jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was recognized by the civil (imperial) power when it became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. But long before this the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, following the exhortation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saint Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs14">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>), were wont to submit to ecclesiastical jurisdiction matters which by their nature belonged to the civil courts. As long as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was not recognized by the State it was left to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the individual whether he would conform to the decision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or not. When, however, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had received civil recognition, <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> raised the former private usage to a public law. According to an imperial constitution of the year 321 the parties in dispute could, by mutual agreement, bring the matter before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> even when it was already pending before a civil judge, and the latter was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to put into effect the decision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A further constitution of 331 provided that in any stage of the suit any one of the parties could appeal to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> even against the will of the others (Hanel, "De constitutionibus, quas F. Sirmondus, Paris, an. 1631 edidit," 1840). But Arcadius, in 398, and Honorius, in 408, limited the judicial competence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to those cases in which both parties applied to him (lex VII, Cod. Just., De audientia episc., I, iv). This arbitral jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not recognized in the new Teutonic kingdoms. In the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdoms purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters of dispute belonged to the jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but mixed cases, in which civil interests appeared, e.g. marriage questions, law suits concerning <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">Church property</a>, etc., belonged to the civil courts.

<p>In the course of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> succeeded in extending its jurisdiction over all matters that offered an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interest (<em>causae spiritualibus annexae</em>), all litigation concerning marriages (c. vii, X, Qui filii sint legit., IV, xvii; c. vii, X, De donat., IV, xx); matters concerning burial (X, De sepult., III, xxviii); testaments (X, De testam., III, xxvi); compacts ratified with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (c. iii, in VI&#176;, De foro compet., II, ii); matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> (c. ii, X, De suppl. neglig. praelat., I, x); questions of patronage (X, De jur. patron., III, xxxviii); litigation concerning <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> (X, De decim., III, xxx). In addition all civil litigation in which the element of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was in question (<em>ratio peccati</em>) could be summonded before an <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> (c. xiii, X, De judic., II, i).

<p>Also, the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> had jurisdiction over the affairs of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> (<em>personae miserabiles</em>), also of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom the civil judge refused legal redress (c. xi, X, De foro compet., II, ii). Owing to the unsatisfactory administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> world this far-reaching <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was beneficial. However, it eventually overlapped the natural boundaries of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The result was that the ecclesiastic became too much involved in secular litigation and grew estranged from his proper calling. For these reasons, but further also for selfish ones, a reaction against this condition of affairs arose in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as early as the twelfth century. The reaction spread to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and gained in influence and justification the more the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by the State improved. At the end of the long vicissitudinous struggle the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lost its jurisdiction in <em>res spiritualibus annexal</em>, notwithstanding the claims of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, De ref., c. vi; sess. XXIV, De sacr. matr., can. xii; sess. XXV, De ref., c. xx), also the privilege of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and finally jurisdiction in matrimonial causes as far as their civil character was concerned.

<p>In regard to ecclesiastical jurisdiction in criminal matters the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exercised jurisdiction at first only in purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offences, and inflicted only <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> punishments, e.g. <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, and in the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> deposition. The observance of these penalties had to be left to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the individual. But with the formal recognition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the State and the increase of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties proportioned to the increase of ecclesiastical offences, came an appeal from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the secular arm for aid in enforcing the said penalties, which aid was always willingly granted. Some offence, indeed, especially deviations from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, were by the State made punishable in <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> and secular penalties were attached to them, also to certain disciplinary misdemeanours of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (Cod. Just., lib. I, tit. v, De haeret. et manich.; tit. vii, De Apost.; tit. ix, De jud. et coelic.). Conversely, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> increased its penal jurisdiction in the civil domain by infliction of varied penalties, some of them purely secular in character. Above all, by means of the <em>privilegium fori</em> it withdrew the so-called "criminous clerks" from the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Then it obtained for the court held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> during his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitation (the <em>send</em>) not only the punishment of those civil misdemeanours which involved the element of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and consequently affected both <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, but it also punished, and as such, purely civil offences. The penal jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church included, therefore, first the merely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offences, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, apostasy, etc.; then the merely civil offences; finally the mixed offences, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh, sacrilege, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, magic, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, etc. In punishing offences of a purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> disposed unreservedly of the aid of the State for the execution of the penalty. When in the aforesaid <em>send</em>, or court held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> during his visitation, it inflicted punishment on the civil offences of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, the penalty, as a rule, was enforced by the count (<em>graf</em>) who accompanied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and represented the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. The principle prevailed later that an offence already punished by a secular judge was no longer punishable by the <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> (c. ii, in VI&#176;, De except., II, xii). When the <em>send</em> began to disappear, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular judges were in general held equally competent for mixed offences. Prevention (previous adjudication of the case by one judge or the other) was decisive (c. viii, X, De foro compet., II, ii). If the matter were brought before the <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> he inflicted at the same time the civil penalty, not, however, corporal punishment or death. If the accusation was brought before the secular judge, the civil penalty was inflicted by him and the action of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was limited to the imposition of a penance. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, eventually lost by far the greater part of its criminal jurisdiction for the same reasons which, since the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, led to the loss of most of its contentious jurisdiction, and in the same manner. Moreover, from the fifteenth century on, the <em>recursus ab abusu</em> which first arose in France (<em>appel comme d'abus</em>), that is the appeal from an abuse of power by an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, did much to weaken and discredit ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
<h2 id="section3">Present scope of jurisdiction in a strict sense</h2>

<p>Today the only objects of contentious ecclesiastical jurisdiction (in which jurisdiction, however, the State often takes part or interferes) are: questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, particularly the contracting and maintenance of marriage, the holding of church services, the creation and modification of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the appointment to and the vacation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> as such, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of patrons, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of religious, the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. As to the criminal jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it now inflicts on the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> only <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties, and solely for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offences. If ever civil consequences ensue, only the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> can take cognizance of them. As regards <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to punish their disciplinary offences and maladministration of their offices, is everywhere acknowledged by the State. Where <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> are not separated, the State aids in investigating these offences, as well as in executing the canonically rendered decisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As to the civil offences of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, ecclesiastical jurisdiction carries with it no secular consequences, though the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is free to punish such offences by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties. According to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis moderationi"</a> (12 October, 1869), those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> fall under the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <em>speciali modo</em>, who directly or indirectly hinder the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the external forum or in the internal forum, as well as those who appeal from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> to <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a>; finally every legislator or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in authority who directly or indirectly compels a judge to cite <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> before a civil tribunal (I, vi, vii, viii). It may be added that in various <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has more or less abandoned the <em>privilegium fori</em> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>: Concordat with <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 1817, art. XII, lit. c. (concerning civil litigation); with Costa Rica, 1853, art XIV, XV; with <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, 1853, art. XV, XVI; with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 1855, art XIII, XIV; with Wurtemburg and Baden, 1857 and 1859, art. V.
