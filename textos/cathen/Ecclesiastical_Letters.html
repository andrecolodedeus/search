<h1>Ecclesiastical Letters</h1>  

<p>(LITTER&AElig; ECCLESIASTIC&AElig;)

<p>Ecclesiastical letters are publications or announcements of the organs of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, more particularly, however, of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, addressed to the faithful in the form of letters.
<h2 id="section1">Letters of the popes in the period of the early Church</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> began early, by virtue of the primacy, to issue <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as well for the entire Church as for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. This was done in the form of letters. Such letters were sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> either of their own will or when application was made to them by <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Apart from the Epistles of the Apostle Peter the first example of this is the Letter of Pope Clement I (90-99?) to the Corinthians, in whose community there was grave dissension. Only a few papal letters of the first three <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries have been preserved in whole or part, or are known from the works of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. As soon, however, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was recognized by the State and could freely spread in all directions, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy of necessity began to develop, and from this time on the number of papal letters increased. No part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and no question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> failed to attract the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> attention. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> called these letters; with reference to their legal character, <em>decreta: statuta: decretalia constituta</em>, even when the letters, as was often the case, were hortatory in form. Thus Siricius, in his letter of the year 385 to Himerius of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> [Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum" (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1885-88), I, no. 255]. Or the letters were called <em>sententi&oelig;</em>, i.e. opinions (Syn. Tur., II, an. 567, c. ii); <em>pr&oelig;cepta</em> (Syn. Bracar., I, an. 561, pr&aelig;f.); <em>auctoritates</em> [Zosimus, an. 417; Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 349]. On the other hand more general letters, especially those of dogmatic importance, were also called at times <em>tomi; indiculi; commonitoria; epistol&oelig; tractori&oelig;, or tractatori&oelig;</em>. If the matter were important, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> issued the letters not by their sole authority, but with the advice of the Roman presbytery or of a synod. Consequently such letters were also called <em>epistol&oelig; synodic&oelig;</em> (Syn. Tolet., III, an. 589, c. i). By <em>epistola synodica</em>, however, is also understood in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity that letter of the newly elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by which he notified the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his elevation and of his agreement with them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Thus an <em>epistola</em> of this kind had a certain relationship to the <em>litter&oelig; format&oelig;</em> by which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> certified, for presentation to another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and unblemished moral character of an ecclesiastic of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Closely related to the <em>litter&oelig; format&oelig;</em> are the <em>litter&oelig; dimissori&oelig;</em> (dimissorials) by which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sends a candidate for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. While these names indicate sufficiently the legal character of the papal letters, it is to be noted that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> repeatedly demanded in explicit terms the observance of their decrees; thus Siricius, in his letter of the year 385 to Himerius (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 255), and <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> in his letter of the year 416 addressed to Decentius of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 311). In the same manner they repeatedly required from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom they wrote that these should bring the letter in question to the notice of others. Thus again Siricius, in his letter to Himerius (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 255); and <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, in the year 418 to Hesychius of Sabona (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 339). In order to secure such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> several copies of the papal letters were occasionally made and dispatched at the same time. In this way arose the letters <em>a pari: a paribus uniformes</em>, <em>ta isa</em> (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, nos. 331, 334, 373). Following the example of the Roman emperors the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> soon established archives (<em>scrinium</em>) in which copies of their letters were placed as memorials for further use, and as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of authenticity. The first mention of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives is found in the Acts of a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held about 370 under Pope Damasus I (<a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>, "Epistol&aelig; Romanorum Pontificum", Paris, 1721, 500). <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> also makes mention in 419 of the archives (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 2nd ed., I, no. 350). Nevertheless, forged papal letters appeared even earlier than this. By far the greater number of the papal letters of the first millennium, however, have been lost. Only the letters of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, edited by the brothers Bablerini, the "Registrum Epistolarum" of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>, edited by Ewald and Hartmann, and the "Registrum Epistolarum" of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, edited by Jaff&eacute;, have been more or less completely preserved. As befitted their legal importance, the papal letters were also soon incorporated in the collections of canon law (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, "Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des kanonischen Rechts im Abendlande bis zum Ausgang des Mittelalters", Graz, 1870, 231 sqq.). The first to collect the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in a systematic and comprehensive manner was the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, at the beginning of the sixth century (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, "Geschichte der Quellen", 422 sqq.). In this way the papal letters took rank with the canons of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> as of equal value and of equal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. The example of Dionysius was followed afterwards by almost all compilers of the canons, <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a> and the Gregorian canonists, e.g. <a href="../cathen/01550d.htm">Anselm of Lucca</a>, Deusdedit, etc.


<h2 id="section2">Letters of the popes in the medieval period</h2>

<p>With the development of the primacy in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the papal letters grew enormously in number. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, following the earlier custom, insisted that their <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>, issued for individual cases, should be observed in all analogous ones. According to the teaching of the canonists, above all of Gratian, every <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> letter of general character was authoritative for the entire Church without further notification. The names of the letters of general authority were very varied: <em>constitutio</em> (c. vi, X, De elect., I, vi); <em>edictum</em> (c. unic., in VIto, De postul., I, v); <em>statutum</em> (c. xv, X, De sent. excomm., V, xxxix); <em>decretum</em> (c. i, in VIto, De pr&aelig;b., III, iv); <em>decretalis</em> (c. xxix, in VIto, De elect., I, vi); <em>sanctio</em> (c. unic., in VIto, De cler. &aelig;grot., III, v). Decrees (<em>decreta</em>) was the name given especially to general ordinances issued with the advice of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (Schulte, "Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des kanonischen Rechtes", Stuttgart, 1876, I, 252 sq.). On the other hand ordinances issued for individual cases were called: <em>rescripta</em>, <em>responsa</em>, <em>mandata</em>. Thus a constitution was always understood to be a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinance which regulated <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions of a general character judicially, in a durable manner and form, for all time; but by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> was understood a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinance issued at the petition of an individual that decided a lawsuit or granted a favour. Compare the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> prefixed to the "Decretals" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, the "Liber Sextus" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and the "Clementin&aelig;"; also the titles, "De constitutionibus" and "De rescriptis" in the "Corpus Juris Canonici". Notwithstanding all this, usage remained uncertain (c. xiv, in VIto, De pr&aelig;b., III, iv). The above-mentioned distinctions between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents were based on the extent of their authority. Other names again had their origin in the form of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> they all had more or less evidently the form of letters. But essential differences appeared, especially in regard to the literary form (<em>stylus</em>) of the document and the method of sealing, these depending in each case on the importance of the contents of the respective document. It was merely the difference in the manner of sealing that led to the distinction between <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and Briefs. For <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, legal instruments almost entirely for important matters, the seal was stamped in wax or lead, seldom in gold, enclosed in a case, and fastened to the document by a cord. For Briefs, instruments used, as a rule, in matters of less importance, the seal was stamped upon the document in wax. Curial letters (<em>litter&oelig; curiales</em> or <em>de curia</em>) denoted particularly letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in political affairs. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, just as in the early Church, the letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were deposited in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives either in the original or by copy. They are still in existence, and almost complete in number, from the time of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216). Many papal letters were also incorporated, as their legal nature required, in the "Corpus Juris Canonici". Others are to be found in the formularies, many of which appeared unofficially in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, similar in kind to the ancient official <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery in use as late as the time of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. The papal letters were forwarded by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> officials, above all by the chancery, for whose use the chancery rules, <em>regul&oelig; cancellari&oelig; Apostolic&oelig;</em>, were drawn up; these rules had regard to the execution and dispatch of the papal letters, and date back to the twelfth century. Nevertheless, the forging of papal letters was even more frequent in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> than in the early Church. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (in c. v, X, De crimine falsi, V, xx) refers to no less than nine methods of falsification. From the thirteenth century on to a few years ago it sufficed, in order to give a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document legal force, to post it up at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the doors of St. Peter's, of the Lateran, the Apostolic Chancery, and in the Piazza del Campo di Fiori. Since 1 January, 1909, they acquire force by publication in the "Acta Apostolic&aelig; Sedis".
<h2 id="section3">Letters of the popes in modern times</h2>

<p>In the modern period also, papal letters have been and still are constantly issued. Now, however, they proceed from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves less frequently than in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity; most of them are issued by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> officials, of whom there is a greater number than in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and to whom have been granted large delegated powers, which include the issuing of letters. Following the example of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Immensa &aelig;terni" of 22 January, 1587, added to the already existing bodies of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> officials a number of congregations of cardinals with clearly defined powers of administration and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> added other congregations. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, however, in the Constitution "Sapienti consilio" of 29 June, 1908, reorganized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. Papal writings are yet divided into Constitutions, <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescripts</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, Briefs, and Apostolic Letters (<em>Litter&oelig; Apostolic&oelig;</em>). The <em>Litter&oelig; Apostolic&oelig;</em> are further divided into <em>Litter&oelig; Apostolic&oelig; simplices</em> or <em>Brevetti</em>, <em>Chirographa</em>, <em>Encyclic&oelig;</em> (Encyclicals), and <em>Motus Proprii</em>. By <em>Litter&oelig; Apostolic&oelig; simplices</em> are understood all documents drawn up by virtue of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization, and signed with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name but not by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> personally. Documents signed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> personally are called <em>Chirographa</em>. Encyclicals are letters of a more hortatory nature, addressed to all or to a majority of the higher officials of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A <em>Motu Proprio</em> is a document prepared at the personal initiative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, without previous petition to him, and issued with a partial avoidance of the otherwise customary forms of the chancery. By <em>Constitution</em> is understood, as in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document of general authority; by <em>Rescript</em>, a similar document applicable to an individual case. <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and Briefs are distinguished from each other by characteristics of form which have always remained essentially the same. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents are still deposited in the Roman archives. There are no official collections of them corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> "Corpus Juris Canonici". The last official collection is that of the Constitutions of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-1758). From the sixteenth century, on the other hand, private collections have appeared, some of which are called <em>bullaria</em>, from the more important part of their contents. Many <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> betters are also found in the collections of the Acts of the Councils. The documents issued by the officials of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the Congregations of Cardinals contain either resolutions (decisions) for individual cases, or declarations (<em>extensiv&oelig;</em> or <em>comprehensiv&oelig;</em>) interpreting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or decrees, which are entirely new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Some congregations of cardinals have issued official collections of their decisions.
<h2 id="section4">Collections of the letters of the popes and of the Roman officials</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>, "Epistol&aelig; Romanorum Pontificum et qu&aelig; ad eos script&aelig; sunt a S.

Hilaro usque ad Pelagium II" (Brunsberg, 1868). From 1881 the Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has published, with particular reference to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the "Registra" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">John XXI</a>, <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>. The "Registra" of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> are also in course of publication. Cf. "M&eacute;langes d'arch&eacute;ologie et d'histoire", XXV, 443 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, "Leonis X Pontificis Maximi Regesta" (Freiburg, 1884-); "Regesta Clementis Pap&aelig; V cura et studio monachorum ordinis S. Benedicti" (Rome, 1885-); Pressuti, "Registrum Honorii III" (Rome, 1888-). There are innumerable collections of papal letters issued from a partisan point of view. All known papal letters up to 1198 are enumerated by Jaff&eacute; in the "Regesta Rom. Pont." The papal letters of 1198-1304 are found in Potthast, "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab anno 1198 ad annum 1304" (Berlin, 1874). Professor Paul Kehr is preparing a critical edition of all papal letters up to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. See the "Nachrichten", of the G&ouml;ttingen Academy of Sciences, 1896, 72 sqq.; "Pii IX acta" (Rome, 1854-); "Leonis XIII acta" (Rome, 1881); "Pii X acta" (Rome, 1907). For the Bullaria, see Tomasetti, "Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum s.

<h2 id="section5">Letters of bishops</h2>

<p>Just as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> largely by means of letters, so also the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> make use of letters for the administration of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The documents issued by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are divided according to their form into pastoral letters, synodal and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, mandates, or ordinances, or decrees, the classification depending upon whether they have been drawn up more as letters, or have been issued by a synod or the chancery. The pastoral letters are addressed either to all the members of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (<em>litter&oelig; pastorales</em>) or only to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in this case generally in Latin (<em>litter&oelig; encyclic&oelig;</em>). The mandates, decrees, or ordinances are issued either by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself or by one of his officials. The synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are ordinances issued by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, with the advice, but in no way with the legislative co-operation, of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, regularly speaking, are those episcopal ordinances which, because they refer to more weighty matters, are prepared with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> or facultative co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. In order to have legal force the episcopal documents must be published in a suitable manner and according to usage. Civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by which episcopal and also <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents have to receive the approval of the State before they can be published are irrational and out of date (<a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, Sess. III, De eccl., c. iii). (See <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">EXEQUATUR</a>.)
