<h1>Ecclesiastical Pension</h1>  

<p>The right to a certain sum of money to be paid yearly out of the revenues of a church or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, on account of just reasons approved by an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior. The term is derived, according to some, from the Latin word <em>pendeo</em>, "to depend"; according to others, from the word <em>pendo</em>, "to pay". The term <em>pensio</em> is sometimes used as synonymous with a certain species of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, as when a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, by the authority of a superior, receives a perpetual vicarship in a church and is sustained by its revenues. This is looked on as the conferring of a real <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. In its ordinary acceptation, however, it does not connote the bestowal of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, but refers to the money paid, for a certain time, to a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the fruits of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> belonging to another, acting under the authorization of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to pay such a pension may be incumbent on either the holder of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> or on the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> itself. If the first, then the burden does not pass to his successor; if the second, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> lasts as long as the pensioner lives.

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has full power over all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, he may impose a pension on any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> whatsoever, even though it belong to a patron. If, however, the patronage belongs to a royal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> does not usually impose the pension without the patron's consent. For validity, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the pontiff give any cause for his act. As to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or anyone inferior to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he may not, generally speaking, impose a perpetual pension on a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> or increase one already existing, nor may he, in conferring a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, make a reservation of a pension to be paid to a third party. It is within the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> power, however, to impose a pension, for a reasonable cause, to last for a certain time, even for the life of the holder of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, if he himself consents. In this case, the pension is not imposed upon the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, but on its incumbent. The canons forbid the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to constitute a pension out of a certain quota of the fruits of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, as a half or a third part, because this has the appearance of a division of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Just causes for the constitution of a pension by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are: for the sake of peace; for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of a poor student; for the utility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for the relief of paupers; for some <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> object; for a reward of services rendered; and for the support of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who resigns a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, in which last case it should be in moderate proportion and not the result of a bargain. For the causes mentioned, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not impose a pension on a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> itself, or to have effect after the decease of the incumbent, though some canonists have maintained the contrary. When a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confers a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, he is not allowed to burden its collation with a pension to be paid to himself, as this would be a <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> transaction.

<p>When two beneficiaries interchange <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, they may not make a pact by which the one receiving the richer post is to pay a pension to the other, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may make such a stipulation of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> on the occasion of the exchange of two beneficiaries. In like manner, while it is <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> for an abdicant to stipulate for a pension out of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> he resigns, yet he may, for grave cause, request the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to give him such a pension, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may bestow it upon him. <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">Simoniacal</a> pacts are those which are made without the intervention of the proper <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority.

<p>Laymen are incapable of receiving ecclesiastical pensions, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> recipient must not be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, suspended, or under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Pensions may be transferred to another by the pensioner, if the proper authority sanctions it. The earliest mention of a pension in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a> is said to be that of Domnus of Antioch, who received one out of the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, which he had vacated at the time of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451.
