<h1>Ecclesiastical Prisons</h1>  

<p>It is plain from many decrees in the <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm">"Corpus Juris Canonici"</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has claimed and exercised the right, belonging to a perfect and visible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, of protecting its members by condemning the guilty to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. The object of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> originally, both among the Hebrews and the Romans, was merely the safe-keeping of a criminal, real or pretended, until his trial. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, however, is that confinement be made use of both as a punishment and as affording an opportunity for reformation and reflection. This method of punishment was anciently applied even to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Thus, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (cap. "Quamvis", iii, "De poen.", in 6) decrees:

<blockquote><p>Although it is known that <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> were specially instituted for the custody of criminals, not for their punishment, yet we shall not find fault with you if you commit to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for the performance of penance, either perpetually or temporarily as shall seem best, those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> subject to you who have confessed crimes or been convicted of them, after you have carefully considered the excesses, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and circumstances involved in the case. </p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adopted the extreme punishment of perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> because, by the canons, the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a> of offenders, whether <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> or lay, could not be ordered by ecclesiastical judges. It was quite common in ancient times to imprison in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, for the purpose of doing penance, those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who had been convicted of grave crimes (c. vii, dist. 50). The "Corpus Juris", however, says (c. "Super His", viii, "De poen.") that incarceration does not of itself inflict the stigma of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> on a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, as is evident from a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pronouncement on the complaint of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who had been committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> because he vacillated in giving testimony. The reply recorded is that <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> does not <em>ipso facto</em> carry with it any note of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>.

<p>As to monastic <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> for members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, we find them recorded in decrees dealing with the incorrigibility of those who have lost the spirit of their vocation. Thus, by command of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, the Congregation of the Council (21 September, 1624) decreed:

<blockquote><p>For the future, no regular, legitimately professed, may be expelled from his order unless he be truly incorrigible. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not to be judged truly incorrigible unless not only all those things are found verified which are required by the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> (notwithstanding the constitutions of any <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order even confirmed and approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>), but also, until the delinquent has been tried by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and patience for one year in confinement. Therefore, let every order have private <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, at least one in every province. </p></blockquote>

<p>The crimes in question must be such as by natural or <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> would merit the punishment of death or <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life (<a href="../cathen/12724c.htm">Reiffenstuel</a>, "Jus Can. univ.", no. 228). <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> reduced the year required by the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to six months (<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Instantibus", 2). A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of the Council (13 November, 1632) declares that a religious is not to be judged incorrigible because he flees from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, unless, after being punished three times, he should make a fourth escape. As the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> do not, at present, permit of incarceration by private authority, the Congregation on the Discipline of Regulars has decreed (22 January, 1886) that trials for incorrigibility, preceding dismissal, should be carried out by summary, not formal, process, and that for each case recourse should be had to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A vestige of the monastic <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> (which, of course, nowadays depends only on moral force) is found in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (4 November, 1892), in which he declares that religious who have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and wish to leave their order cannot, under pain of perpetual suspension, depart from the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> (exire ex clausura) until they have been adopted by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
