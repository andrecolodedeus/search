<h1>Ecclesiastical Privileges</h1>  

<p>Ecclesiastical privileges are exceptions to the Law made in favour of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or in favour of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and sacred objects and places.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The privileges in favour of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are: personal inviolability, a special court, immunity from certain burdens and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a proper maintenance (<em>privilegium canonis, fori, immunitatis, competenti&oelig;</em>). In addition, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have precedence of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in religious assemblies and processions, a special place in the church, viz., the presbytery (c. 1, X de vita et honestate cleric., III, 1), and titles of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. These honours increase according to the higher order or office.
<h3><em>Privilegium canonis</em></h3>

<p>In earlier canon law the injuring or wounding of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> was punished by severe canonical penances, and on occasion by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (cc. 21, 22, 23, 24, C. XVII, q. 4). A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wounding a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> incurred <em>ipso facto</em> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (Synod of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 862 or 863, c. xiv). When about the middle of the twelfth century at the instigation of politico-religious agitators, like <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, excesses were committed against the defenceless <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and religious, who were forbidden to carry weapons, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was compelled to make stricter <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Thus, the Second Council of Lateran (1139), c. xv, after the Synods of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (1130), <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1131), and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (1135), decreed that whosoever thenceforth laid malicious hand on a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> incurred <em>ipso facto</em> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, the raising of which, except in danger of death, was reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and must be sought in person at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (c. 29, C. XVII, q. 4).

<p>This privilege, which, from the opening words of the canon, is called the <em>privilegium canonis</em> "Si quis suadente diabolo" or simply <em>privilegium canonis</em>, continues even today (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis moderationi"</a>, 12 October, 1869, II, 2), and is enjoyed also by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (c. 33, X de sent. excomm. V, 39), <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> (c. 33 cit.), <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> (c. 21 in VIto h. t. V, 11), and even by tertiaries, who live in common and wear the habit (<a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, "Dum intra", 19 December, 1516; "Nuper in sacro", 1 March, 1518). According to the wording of the canon, however, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for the incurring of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, that the injury inflicted on the cleric or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> be a malicious and real injury, under which is included unauthorized deprivation of freedom (c. 29, X h. t. V, 39). Consequently, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is not incurred by a superior justly chastising one of his inferiors (cc. 1, 10, 24, 54, X h. t. V, 39); by one who acts in self-defence against a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> (cc. 3, 10, X h. t. V, 39), by one who avenges insult or assault on wife, mother, sister, or daughter (c. 3 cit.); when the injury results from a joke (c. 1, X h. t. V, 39), or if the assailant be unaware (to be testified on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> rank (c. 4, X h. t. V, 39). Instead of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the case of a slight injury (a. 3, 17, 31, X h. t. V, 39); or if a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> be impossible; if the obstacle to the journey be only temporary, the assailant must promise the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> at the time of receiving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> to present himself before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the disappearance of the obstacle; should he fail to do so, the sentence revives (cc. 1, 2, 6, 11, 13, 26, 32, 33, 37, 58, 60, X h. t. V, 39; c. 22 in VIto h. t. V, 11). According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may also absolve when there is question of secret offences (Sess. XXIV de Ref., c. vi) and, in virtue of the quinquennial faculties <em>pro foro interno</em>, of the less serious offences. In consequence of the more extensive powers of releasing from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures enjoyed by confessors today, personal appearance at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is perhaps <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> only in the most serious cases. Abbots absolve their subjects in the case of lighter offences occurring among themselves (c. 2, 32, 50, X h. t. V, 39). This privilege grows with the office. Thus, whosoever commits or causes a real injury to a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> incurs <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <em>speciali modo reservata</em> (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis moderationi"</a>, 12 October, 1869, I, 5). While the old German <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> punished the injuring of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> with a heavier fine than the injuring of a lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the modern secular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> like the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, afford special protection to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> only during the exercise of their calling.
<h3><em>Privilegium fori</em></h3>

<p>This secures the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a special tribunal in civil and criminal causes before an <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a>. The civil causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> pertain by nature to the secular courts as much as those of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. But the thought that it was unseemly that the fathers and teachers of the faithful should be brought before <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> as judges, and also the experience that many <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were greatly inclined to oppress the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (c. 3 in VIto de immun., III, 23), led the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to withdraw her servants even in civil matters from the secular courts, and to bring them entirely under her own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.



<p>In the Roman Empire, in virtue of the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> could in civil disputes cite another only before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (cc. 43, 46, C. XI, q. 1). However, these synodal decrees obtained no recognition from the lay courts, until Justinian relegated all disputes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> among one another and complaints of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to the ecclesiastical forum (Novella lxxix, lxxxiii, cxxiii, cc. 8, 21, 22). In the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, also, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> could Summon one another only before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in civil causes (First Synod of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, 583, c. 8), while <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> engaged in a civil dispute with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> could proceed before the secular court only with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission (Third Synod of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 538, c. 35). The Edict of Clotaire II (614), c. 4, altered the existing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by determining that at least actions for <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> might also be brought before the episcopal tribunal. The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> legislation made herein no alteration, but it forbade <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> expressly to appear personally before the civil courts, ordering them to appoint a defender (<em>advocatus</em>) to represent them (Admonitio generalis, 789, c. 23).

<p>In criminal causes, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had in the Roman Empire no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, except in trivial matters. To him pertained only the deposition of the criminal cleric before punishment was inflicted by the secular judge (Novella cxxiii, c. 21, &#167; 1; cxxxvii, c. 4). In the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were condemned and degraded at the synod, whereupon the secular court executed the sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Still more in the case of the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> did the power of the lay courts to inflict punishment prevail. But, from the time of the Edict of Clotaire II (614), <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> began to be treated in the same manner as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In this respect the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> legislation remained essentially the same (Synod of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 794, c. 30). The gradual liberation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the lay forum received a further incentive from the ever-increasing number of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> causes, from the acceptance of the dictum that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were subject to personal, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> prohibition to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to engage in <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duels</a> or ordeals, from the growing political importance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as counts and territorial lords after the disintegration of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Empire. Thus, in view of the ferocious acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> committed by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a> could demand in the most urgent terms that no cleric be summoned before the secular courts (cc. 1, 3, 9, 10, 37, C. XI, q. 1). This principle was called into life by the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and, by <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> law, the exclusive competence of ecclesiastical judges over <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in civil and criminal causes was established (cc. 4, 8, 10, 17, X de iud., II, 1; cc. 1, 2, 9, 12, 13, X de foro compet., II, 2). In <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> affairs alone were the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> subject to the secular courts (cc. 6, 7, X de foro compet., II, 2). The <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a> were thus competent for civil causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> among one another, of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and for all criminal causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. This <em>privilegium fori</em> was also recognized by imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (Authentica of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, "Statuimus", 1139 ad 1. 33, C. de episc. I, 3). From early times, however, it met with great opposition from the State. With the growing ascendancy of the State over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the privilege was more and more limited, and was finally everywhere abrogated.

<p>Today, according to secular law, the civil and criminal causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> belong to the lay court. Only with respect to the purely spiritual conditions of their station and office, are <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> subject to their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and then not without certain state limitations &mdash; especially with respect to certain practical punishments. However, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> maintains in principle the <em>privilegium fori</em>, even for those in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, provided that they have the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and wear <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb, and either already serve in a church or are preparing in a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> or <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for the reception of higher orders (Council of Trent, Sess. XXIII de Ref., c. vi; Sess. XXV de Ref., c. xx; Syllabus, n. 31). On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have in their recent <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> to a great extent relinquished this position. They have, however, demanded that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be apprised of criminal proceedings against a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, so that he may be able to take the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> measures (Bavarian Concordat, art. xii, litt. c.; Austrian Concordat, art. xiii, xiv; Concordat with Costa Rica, art. xiv, xv; that with <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, art. xvi, xvii; that with Nicaragua, art. xiv, xv; that with San Salvador, art. xiv, xv). This warning of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is also ordered by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of many states, as well as a similar regard for the cleric himself in the case of criminal proceedings (Regulation of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Minister of Justice of 12 June, 1873; of 25 August, 1879; Austrian Law of 7 May, 1874, &#167;29).

<p>But, wherever the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has not relinquished the <em>privilegium fori</em>, lawgivers and administrators, who directly or indirectly compel the judges to summon <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> before the secular forum, incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> specially reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis moderationi"</a>, 12 October, 1869, I, 7). In places where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> derogation of the <em>privilegium fori</em> has not been secured but where <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can be obtained only before the secular judge, a lay complainant, before summoning a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> before the secular courts, should seek the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission, or, if the complaint be against a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the permission of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Otherwise, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can take punitive measures against him (S. Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, 23 January, 1886). It is also in accordance with the spirit of the <em>privilegium fori</em> that it is ordered in many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that all complaints of and against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> be laid first before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for settlement; should no settlement be reached, the case may then be brought before the secular court [Archiv f&uuml;r kathol. Kirchenrecht, VII (1862), 200 sqq.; LXXXIII (1903), 505 sq., 562; LXXXV (1905), 571; LXXXVI (1906), 356 sq.].
<h3><em>Privilegium immunitatis</em></h3>

<p>This consists in the exemption of <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a>, things, and places from certain general <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and taxation. The immunity is, therefore, either personal, or real, or local. Personal immunity is the exemption of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from certain public burdens and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, which the general religious sentiment of the people declares in keeping with their office or which render the discharge of their calling difficult. Whether this privilege, as well as the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> privileges, rests on <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never dogmatically decided, although canon law declares that churches and <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> and things are free from secular burdens according to both Divine and human law (c. 4 in VIto de cens., III, 20); that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunity rests on the Divine command (Council of Trent, Sess. XXV de Ref., c. xx); and that it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to assert that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunity can be traced only from secular law; that the immunity of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from military service could be abolished without any breach of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> or of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nay that it must be abolished in the interests of progress and civil equality (Syllabus, nn. 30, 32).

<p>In accordance with the liberties granted the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors after Constantine exempted the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of undertaking municipal offices, trusteeships, guardianships, and all public functions, from military service, quartering, and the other personal <em>munera sordida</em> (later called villainage), and in part also from personal taxation (Cod. Just., 1. I, t. 3 de episc. Novella cxxiii, c. 5). For the most part these privileges also prevailed in the Teutonic kingdoms. Thus, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> exempted the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from all taxation and from all socage and teaming (Authentica, "Item nulla" 1220 ad 1. 2, C. de episc. I, 3). But <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> law (c. 3 in VIto de immun. III, 23; c. 3 in Clem. de cens. III, 13) demanded the complete immunity of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (cc. 2, 4, 7, X de immun. III, 49; c. 4 in VIto de cens. III, 20; c. 3 in VIto de immun. III, 23; c. 3 in Clem. de cens. III, 13; c. un. in Clem. de immun. III, 17). This immunity was indeed in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and especially at the end, complete, since in many cases we find the secular rulers doing their utmost to impose secular burdens on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV de Ref., c. xx), therefore, again exhorts the princes to respect this privilege. In recent times, and especially since the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, the State's demands on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have been increasing. Hence the above-cited explanations of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the Syllabus, nn. 30, 32.

<p>The exemption of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from national taxation is today almost entirely abolished; their exemption from municipal taxation still continues in some places. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are exempt from public offices and services and from serving as assessors and jurors. In these countries the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are also free from undertaking trusteeships, if they do not obtain the consent of their superiors. Finally, candidates for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, and still more <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, are exempted in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> from military service under arms. Less favour is shown the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and practically none in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> since the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Conditions vary greatly in other lands.
<h3><em>Privilegium competenti&oelig;</em></h3>

<p>This is a right possessed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in accordance with which, in the case of executions against their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> an income, sufficient to constitute a livelihood, must be left to them. A <em>beneficium competenti&oelig;</em> was enjoyed by the Roman soldiers (fr. 6, 18, D. de re iudic. XLII, 1). The Glossa argues that, since the cleric is a <em>miles c&oelig;lestis militi&oelig;</em> (cf. also c. 19, C. XXIII, q. 8), the same privilege should be recognized in his case. But this constitutes as poor a foundation as the c. "Odoardus" (c. 3, X. de solut. III, 23), according to which <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> may not be inflicted on an insolvent cleric, who binds himself to pay on the improvement of his financial position. The origin of the privilege is to be referred rather to custom and to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> expressed in many canons, that a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> may not be brought into such a position that he is forced to seek a livelihood in an unworthy manner. In both theory and practice the privilege afforded protection from personal arrest, foreclosure of a mortgage, and from the immediate vacation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in favour of the lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It also extended to the patrimony forming the title of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. On the other hand, if the cleric has judicially denied his guilt, has been guilty of a <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, disregarded cautions, or if the lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be poorer than the debtor, the privilege is lost.

<p>Since the abolition of the <em>privilegium fori</em>, the scope of the <em>privilegium competenti&oelig;</em> has been dependent on the state <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Thus, according to &#167; 850, Ziff. 8 of the civil suit regulations of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, the yearly income or the pension of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> is free from seizure to the extent of 1500 marks, and of the excess only one-third is liable. According to &#167; 811, Ziff. 7 8 10, all objects <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the discharge of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> calling (e.g. books, proper clothing) are also exempt from seizure. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 21 April, 1882, 800 gulden annually are exempt in the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> employed in the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> beneficiaries, and 500 in the case of other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> also the <em>privilegium competenti&oelig;</em> still prevails, but it has been abolished in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>As the <em>privilegia clericorum</em> are the legal consequences of the religious station, granted for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> calling, they may not, being the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a class, be waived by any individual, nor may they be withdrawn from an individual except in specified cases. They are forfeited by degradation (c. 2 in VIto de p&oelig;n. V, 9); by the committing of a serious criminal act and simultaneously laying aside the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb in spite of a triple warning of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (cc. 14, 23, 25, 45, X de sent. excomm. V, 39; c. 10, X de iud. II, 1; c. 1, X de apostat. V, 9); by leading an unseemly or despicable life and simultaneously laying aside the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb spite of three warnings from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (c. 16, X de vita et honest. cleric. III, 1; c un. in VIto h. t. III, 1; c. 1 in Clem. h. t. III, 1); and finally in the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> by laying aside the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 20 September, 1860).
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>Like <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and sacred things and places enjoy certain privileges and freedom from burdens and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>; this is based on the <em>privilegium immunitatis</em>, and is termed real or local immunity. All objects intended for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> use are termed <em>res ecclesiastic&oelig;</em>. <em>Res ecclesiastic&oelig;</em> in this wide sense are divided into <em>res ecclesiastic&oelig;</em> in the narrow sense and <em>res sacr&oelig;</em>. Ecclesiastical things (<em>res ecclesiastic&oelig;</em> in the narrow sense), or <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclestiastical property</a> (<em>patrimonium</em> or <em>peculium ecclesiasticum</em>), mediately maintain the Divine worship, and include all buildings and real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> except the churches and cemeteries, the funds for the maintenance of the servants of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>bona mens&oelig;, bona beneficii</em>), and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings (<em>bona fabric&oelig;</em>), and finally the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> designed for charitable objects or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations (<em>res religios&oelig;, caus&oelig; pi&oelig;</em>). Sacred objects (<em>res sacr&oelig;</em>) are immediately connected with Divine worship, and are set apart from all other things by an act of worship or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as things <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (<em>res consecrat&oelig;</em>), and by benediction as things blessed (<em>res benedict&oelig;</em>). To <em>res consecrat&oelig;</em> belong churches, altars, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a> and <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">patens</a>; to <em>res benedict&oelig;</em> a series of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> utensils and cemeteries.

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> serves for the public good, it was exempted by the Roman emperors from all the lower and extraordinary burdens, but not from the regular taxes (1. 3, C. de episc. I, 3). This example was followed in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> empire, in which <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was subject to all the ordinary public burdens. In addition, however, many extraordinary burdens were imposed, such as the <em>dona gratuita</em> to the king, the furnishing of accommodation for him on his journeys, the rendering of court and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> services to him as their <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord, and many arbitrary forms of oppression. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a> (1179) demanded the complete exemption of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> from taxation, and that only in case of public need, and then only with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, should it be subjected to public burdens (cc. 2, 4, 7, X de immun. III, 49; c. 1, 3, in VIto h. t. III, 23; c. un. in Clem. h. t. III, 17; c. un. Extrav. commun. III, 13). <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> accordingly granted <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> exemption from all taxation (Authentica "Item nulia" ad 1. 2, C de episc. I, 3). After the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, however, secular rulers subjected to a great extent <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> to public burdens; the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> therefore admonished them to respect the old privilege of <em>immunitas realis</em> (Seas. XXV de Ref., c. xx), but without much success. In modern and recent times the tendency has everywhere been to subject <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> more and more to public taxation. The assertion that the privilege of <em>immunitas realis</em> was of purely secular origin was declared <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the Syllabus, n. 30. Here and there, as in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the State <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> accord partial freedom from taxation to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is alone exempt; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> exemption ceased with the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shares in the exemption generally granted to all institutions labouring for the public good. The conditions vary much in the other lands.

<p>For places and things <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Divine service no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> can be claimed which involve a profane use. Consequently, such objects are in this sense extra-commercial. Otherwise, in sharp distinction from the <em>res sacr&oelig;</em> among the Romans and contrary to the practice of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries, they may, in accordance with the Germanic conception of private churches, be possessed by private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and even enter into civil transactions and commerce. In churches and cemeteries, however, no judicial transactions, political meetings, markets, banquets, theatrical performances, secular concerts, dances etc., may be held. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may in all cases sanction their use outside of Divine service, provided that all <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> be avoided. Similarly, the use of the church-bell for secular purposes may be allowed or tolerated apart from cases of need, where the propriety of its use is self-evident (cc. 1, 5, 9, X. de immun. III, 49; c. 2 in VIto h. t. III, 23). Mischief, disorder, and disturbance in the church (especially during Divine service), <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> of the church, the injury or destruction of things or buildings <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> to the Divine service, disturbance of the peace proper to the cemetery or churchyard, are punished by the State as qualified crimes.

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> local immunity belongs the right of asylum of churches. Even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> it was decreed that the murderer or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> might be safe from vengeance in certain places, until the public had come to a decision concerning his surrender (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#vrs13">Exodus 21:13</a>; <a href="../bible/num035.htm#vrs6">Numbers 35:6 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/deu019.htm#vrs2">Deuteronomy 19:2 sqq.</a>). Among the Greeks, and especially among the Romans, the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, the altars, and the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the emperor were places of refuge (1, l, C. de his qui ad statuas confugiunt I, 25). Thus, when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became the religion of the State, it followed as an inevitable consequence that the emperor should also raise to the right of sanctuary the churches and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (C. Just. de his qui ad ecclesias confugiunt I, 12). But, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> right of sanctuary was still very limited, the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Synod of Carthage</a> (399) asked the emperor to remove these limitations. In the German empires it was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which founded the right of asylum as a protection against the rude conception of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> then prevalent and against savage revenge, by decreeing with the assent of the State that a criminal, who had reached the church or its immediate neighbourhood, might be delivered up only after he had performed <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penance, and after the secular judge had promised that sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> or maiming would not be inflicted upon him (cc. 19, 36, C. XVII, q. 4, Capitulare de partibus Saxoni&aelig;, 775-90, c. 2). The right of asylum, which had its origin in this manner and which was subsequently extended to the surroundings of the church, the cemeteries, the dwellings of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priests, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, was upheld especially by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, although they excluded from the privilege very great criminals, such as highway robbers, murderers, and those who chose the church or churchyard as the scene of their crimes so as to enjoy immediately the right of asylum (cc. 6, 10, X de immun. III, 49; c. 1, X de homic. V, 12).

<p>Since the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, however, State legislation has been opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> right of asylum, so that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have been compelled to modify it more and more (<a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>, "Cum alias" of 24 May, 1591; <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, "Ex quo divina", 8 June, 1725; <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, "In suprema justiti&aelig;", 1 Feb., 1734; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "Officii Nostri", 15 March, 1750). The modern penal codes no longer recognize an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> right of asylum, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can all the more readily acquiesce therein, as modern <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is humane and well-regulated. However, even today those who violate "ausu temerario" the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> right of asylum incur <em>excommunicatio lat&oelig; sententi&oelig;</em> simply reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, "Apost. Sedis moderationi", 12 Oct., 1869, II, 5).
