<h1>Ecclesiastical Property</h1>  

<h2>Abstract right of ownership</h2>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to acquire and possess temporal goods is a proposition which may now probably be considered an established principle. But though almost self-evident and universally acted upon in practice, this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has met with many contradictors. <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">Scandalized</a> by frequent examples of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a>, or misled by an impossible ideal of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> entirely spiritualized and raised above human needs, <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, then somewhat later <a href="../cathen/09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a>, and finally the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffites</a>, formulated various extreme views regarding the lack of temporal resources which befitted <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Gospel. Under <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Marsilius and his forerunners had provoked the two Decrees "Cum inter nonnulles" (13 Nov., 1323) and "Licet juxta doctrinam" (23 Oct., 1323) by which it was affirmed that our Lord and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> held <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ownership in the temporal things which they possessed, and that the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were not rightfully at the disposition of the emperor (see <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, nn. 494-5). Somewhat less than a century later the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliff</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> were condemned at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, nn. 586, 598, 612, 686-6, etc.) and it was equivalently <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> might without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> hold temporal possessions, that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appropriate ecclesiastical property, and that if they did so they might be punished as guilty of sacrilege. In later times these positions have been still more explicitly reaffirmed and in particular by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Quanta cura" (1864) condemned the opinion that the claims advanced by the civil Government to the ownership of all Church property could be reconciled with the principles of sound <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and the canon law (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n. 1697, and the appended Syllabus, props. 26 and 27).

<p>But apart from these and other similar pronouncements the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the complete control of such temporal possessions as have been bestowed upon her is grounded both on reason and tradition. In the first place the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as an organized and visible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, performing public <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> whether of worship or administration, requires material resources for the orderly discharge of these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Neither could this end be sufficiently attained if the resources were entirely precarious or if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were hampered in her use of them by the constant interference of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. In the second place <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> analogy (see, e.g., <a href="../bible/num018.htm#vrs8">Numbers 18:8-25</a>), the practice of the Apostles (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs6">John 12:6</a>; <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs24">Acts 4:24-5</a>) with certain explicit utterances of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, for example, the argument in <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 9:3 sq.</a>, and finally the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at all periods, recognize no dependence upon the State, but show plainly that the principle of absolute ownership and free administration of ecclesiastical property has always been maintained. It may be further noted that in some of the sternest of her disciplinary enactments the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that she takes for granted her dominion over the goods bestowed upon her by the charity of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The twelfth canon of the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">&OElig;cumencal Council of Lyons</a> (1274) pronounces <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <em>ipso facto</em> against those <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a> who seize and detain the temporal possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see Friedberg, "Corpus Juris", II, 953 and 1059) and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> followed suit in its Sess. XXII (De ref. C. xi) by launching <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunications</a> <em>lat&aelig; sententia</em> against those who usurped many different kinds of ecclesiastical property.
<h2>Subject of rights of property</h2>

<p>But while the abstract right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her representatives to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is clear enough, there has been in past ages much vagueness and diversity of view as to the precise subject in whom this right was vested. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a corporate body, as that of an organized group of men (<em>universitas</em>) which has <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> other than the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of all or any of its members, existed, no doubt, at least obscurely in the early centuries of the Roman Empire. Before the time of Justinian it was pretty clearly apprehended that the members of such a group formed legally but a single unit and might be regarded as a "fictitious person", though this conception of the <em>persona ficta,</em> dear to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> legists and perpetuated by men like Savigny, is not perhaps quite so much in vogue among modern students of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> (cf. Gierke, "Das deutsche Genossenschaftsrecht", III, 129-36). It was at any rate recognized that this "fictitious person", or "group-person", was not subject to death like the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of which it was composed, and on the other hand that it could not be called into existence by private agreement. It required a <em>senatus consultum</em> or something of the sort to be legally constituted.

<p>These well-understood principles, we might suppose, could easily have been invoked to regulate the ownership of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in the case of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities established in the Roman Empire, but the question in point of fact was complicated by a survival of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which attached to what were called <em>res sacr&aelig;</em> in the old days of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. This title of "sacred things" was given to all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or utensils <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the gods, though it was required that there should be some authoritative recognition of such <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. As <em>res sacr&aelig;</em> these things were regarded as in a sense withdrawn from the exercise of ordinary ownership, and formed a category apart. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seems to be that the gods themselves in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times were often conceived of as the owners. This is suggested by the fact that while it was ruled that the gods, i.e., their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, could not inherit at law, still certain <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> were explicitly exempted from this inhibition and were allowed to inherit as any private individual inherited. Such <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> were, for example, Jupiter Tarpeius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Apollo Didym&aelig;us of <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, Diana of the Ephesians, and others (Ulpian, "Frag.", 22, 6). In similar wise when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became the established <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the empire, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">"Jesus Christ"</a> was often appointed heir, and Justinian construed such an appointment as a gift to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the place of the testator's domicile (Codex 1, 2, 25). The same principles were followed when an archangel or a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was appointed heir, and this, Justinian tells us, was sometimes done by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> people. The gift was understood to be made to some shrine or church bearing that dedication which the circumstances indicated, and, failing such indication, to the church of the testator's domicile (Cod. 1, 2, 25). The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> in any case seems to have assumed a certain protective control over <em>res sacr&aelig;</em> probably with the view of safeguarding their inviolability. "Sacred things", we read, "are things that have been duly, that is by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (<em>pontifices</em>), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;sacred buildings, for instance, and gifts duly dedicated to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And these we by our constitution have forbidden to be alienated or burdened (<em>obligari</em>) except only in order to ransom captives. But if a man by his own authority establish a would-be sacred thing for himself, it is not sacred, but profane. A place, however, in which sacred buildings have been erected, even if the buildings be pulled down, remains still sacred, as Papinian too wrote" (Institutes, II, i, 8). As regards alienation, however, we may compare Cod. 1, 2, 21, which allowed the sale of church property to sustain the lives of men during a famine, and "Novel.", cxx, 10, permitting the sale, in case of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, of a church's superfluous vessels but not of its immovables or things really <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.



<p>These and similar provisions have been invoked to support very divergent theories as to the ownership of church property under the empire. The real fact seems to be that among the jurists of the early centuries no clear conception as to the precise subject of these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> was ever adopted. In later times many canonists, like Phillips and Lammer, have maintained that the property was vested in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>ecclesia catholica</em>) as a whole. Others like Seitz and <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassinus</a> favour a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> ownership by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself was regarded as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> proprietor. To others again, and notably to Savigny, the theory has commended itself that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> held <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as a community, while many still more modern authorities, with Friedberg, S&#228;gm&uuml;ller, and Meurer, defend the view that each separate local church was regarded as an institution with proprietary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and was identified, at least popularly, with its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. According to this conception the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were the successors of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> gods, and whereas previously Jupiter Tarpeius, or Diana of the Ephesians, had owned land and revenues and <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, so now under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian dispensation</a> <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> or St. Mary or St. Peter were regarded as the proprietors of all that belonged to the churches that were respectively dedicated to them.

<p>No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this view obtains some apparent support from the fact that almost everywhere, and notably in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, at the dawn of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> we find testators bequeathing <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In the oldest Kentish charter of which the text is preserved the newly-converted Ethelbert says: "To thee St. Andrew, and to thy church at Rochester where Justus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides, do I give a portion of my land." Even as late as the Domesday inquisition the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is often depicted as the landowner. "St. Paul holds land, St. Constantine holds land, the Count of Mortain holds lands of St. Petroc&mdash;the church of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, an episcopal church, has lands, and St. Mary of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> holds them" (Pollock and Maitland, "Hist. of English Law", I, 501). But the most recent authorities, and amongst others Professor Maitland himself in his second edition, are inclined to regard such phrases as mere popular locutions, a personification which must not be pressed as if it involved any serious theory as to the ownership of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> seems to be, as Knecht has shown (System des Justinianischen Kirchenverm&ouml;gensrechts, pp. 5 sq.), that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> was a unique institution which it was impossible for the traditional conceptions of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> to assimilate successfully. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had in the end to build up its own system of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of ecclesiastical property were protected efficiently enough in practice and the questions of legal theory did not occur, or at any rate did not press for a solution.

<p>From the time of the Edict of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, issued by Constantine and Licinius in 313, we hear of the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> "known to belong to their community, that is to say their churches, and not to the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>" ("ad jus corporis eorum, id est ecclesiarum, non hominum singulorum pertinentia"&mdash;Lactantius, "De morte pers.", xlviii), while a few years later by the Edict of 321 the right of bequeathing <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by will "to the most holy and venerable community (<em>concilio</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" was guaranteed. Practically speaking there can be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> "concilium", "collegium", "corpus" or "conventiculum" (the words principally used to indicate the body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believers) denoted primarily the local <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> assemblies represented by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and that it was to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that the administration of such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was committed. What stands out most clearly from the enactments of the time of Justinian was the recognition of the right of individual Churches to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Despite the recent attempt of Bondroit (De capacitate possidendi ecclesi&aelig;, 123-36) to revive the old conception of a <em>dominium eminens</em> vested in the universal Church <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, there is not much evidence to show that such a view was current among the jurists of that age though it undoubtedly grew up later (see Gierke, "Genossenschaftsrecht", III, 8). So far as <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> went, Justinian busied himself with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of particular <em>&rsquo;ekkles&#237;a</em>, but at the same time he did encourage a centralizing tendency which left a supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands within the limits of the <em>civitas,</em> his own sphere of authority.

<p>There can be no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which possessed their goods as independent institutions, though even then under the superintendence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (see authorities in Knecht, op. cit., p. 58), the whole ecclesiastical property of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> control and at his disposal. His powers were very large, and his subordinates, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, received only the stipends which he allowed them, while not only the support of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> assistants, who generally shared a common table in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house, but also the sums devoted to the relief of the sick and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to the ransom of captives, as well as to the upkeep and repair of churches, all depended immediately upon him. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> custom regulated in some measure the distribution of the resources available. Popes Simplicitus in 475, Gelasius in 494 (Jaff&eacute;-Wattenbach, "Regesta", 636), and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> in his answer to Augustine (Bede, "Hist. eccl.", I, xxvii) quotes as traditional the rule "that all emoluments that accrue are to be divided into four portions&mdash;one for the bishop and his household because of hospitality and entertainments, another for the clergy, a third for the poor, and a fourth for the repair of churches", and then texts naturally were incorporated at a later date in the "Decretum" of Gratian.
<h2>Church property in the Middle Ages</h2>

<p>Centralization of this kind, however, leaving everything, as it did, in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands, was adapted only to peculiar local conditions and to an age which was far advanced in commerce and orderly government. For the sparsely settled and barbarous regions occupied by the Teutonic invaders changes would sooner or later become <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But at first the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Angles, and others, who accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> took over the system already existing in the Roman Empire. The Council of Orl&eacute;ans in 511 enacted in its fifteenth <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that every kind of contribution or rent offered by the faithful was in accordance with the ancient canons to remain entirely at the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though of the gifts actually presented at the altar he was to receive only a third part. So with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right of ownership, her freedom to receive legacies and the inviolability of her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the pages of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> bear ample evidence to the generosity with which religion was treated during the early Merovingian period (cf. Hauck, "Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands", I, 134-7)&mdash;so much so that Chilperic (c. 580) complained that the royal treasury was exhausted because all the wealth of the kingdom had been transferred to the churches.

<p>Almost everywhere the respect due to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was put in the foremost place. As Maitland has remarked (Hist. of Engl. Law, I, 499), "God's <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> twelvefold" are the first written words of English law. The consciousness of all that was involved in this code of King Ethelbert of Kent (c. 610) had evidently made a deep impression upon the mind of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>. "Among other benefits", he says, "which he [Ethelbert] conferred upon the nation, he also, by the advice of wise <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, introduced judicial decrees, after the Roman model, which, being written in English, are still kept and observed by them. Among which he in the first place set down what satisfaction should be given by those who should steal anything belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, resolving to give protection to those whose <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he had embraced" (Hist. eccl., II, 5). Even more explicit is the famous privilege of Wihtred, King of Kent, a hundred years later (c. 696): "I, Wihtred, an earthly king, stimulated by the heavenly King and kindled with the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of righteousness, have learned from the institutes of our forefathers that no <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> ought with right to appropriate to himself a church or any of the things which to a church belong. And therefore strongly and faithfully we appoint and <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, and in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> we forbid to all Kings our successors, and to all earldom, and to all <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, ever any lordship over churches, and over any of their possessions which I or my predecessors in days of old have given for the glory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and our lady St. Mary and the holy Apostles" (Hadden and Stubbs, "Councils", III, 244).

<p>This touches no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon a difficulty which had just begun to be felt and which for many centuries to come was to be a menace to the religious peace and well being of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. As already suggested, the primitive <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a single church in each civitas, governed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was assisted by <em>presbiterium</em> of subordinate <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, was unworkable in rude and sparsely populated districts. In those more northerly regions of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> which now began to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, village churches remote from one another had to be provided, and though many no doubt were founded and maintained by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves (cf. Fustel de Coulanges, "La monarchie franque", 517) the religious centres, which became the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of a later date, developed in most cases out of the private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> of the landowners and thegns. The great man built his church and then set himself to find a clerk who the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> might ordain to serve it. It was not altogether surprising if he looked upon the church as his church seeing that it was built upon his land. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> consent was also needed. It was for him to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the altar and from him that the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the destined incumbent had to be sought. He will not act unless a sufficient provision of worldly goods is secured for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Here we see the origin of patronage. This "advowson" (<em>advocatio</em>), or right to present to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, is in origin an ownership of the soil upon which the church stands and an ownership of the land or goods set apart for the sustenance of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who serves it. Obviously the sense of proprietorship engendered by this relation was very dangerous to peace and to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberty. Where such advowsons rested in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or monastic institutions, there was nothing very unseemly in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the patron "owning" the church, its lands, and its resources. In point of fact a large and ever-increasing number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches were made over to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> provided a "vicar' to discharge the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest, but absorbed the revenues and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, spending them no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> for the most part in works of utility and charity. But while the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> for example presenting a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> "proprietario jure possidendum", "to be held in absolute ownership", excites no protest, the case was different when <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> took back to their own use the revenues which their fathers had allocated to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or when kings began to assert a patronage over ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, or again when the emperor wanted to treat the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> as a sort of fief and private possession of his own.

<p>In any case it is plain that the general tendency of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> movement, more especially when the churches originated in the private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> of the landowners, was to take much of the control of church property out of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A canon of the Third Council of Toledo (589), re-enacted subsequently elsewhere, speaks very significantly in this connexion. "There are many", it says, "who against the canonical rule, seek to get their own churches <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> upon such terms as to withdraw their endowment (<em>dotem</em>) from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> power of disposition. This we disapprove in the past and for the future forbid" (cf. <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, X, 119). On the other hand many ordinances, for example that of the Council of Carpentras in 527 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VIII, 707), make it quite clear that while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> right was maintained in theory, the practice prevailed of leaving the offerings of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to the church in which they were made so long as they were there needed. The payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, which seems first to have been put forward as a contribution of general <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> by certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in the sixth century (see Selborne, "Ancient facts and fiction", cap. xi), must have told in the same direction. It seems tolerably plain that this collection must always have been undertaken locally, and the threefold partition of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which is spoken of in the so-called "Capitulare episcoporum" and which reappears in the "Egbertine Exceptions" takes no account of any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> share. The <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are to be devoted first to the upkeep of the church, secondly to the relief of the poor and of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and thirdly to the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> themselves. Even if, according to the celebrated ordinance of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in 778-9, the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which everyone was bound to give "were to be dispensed according to the bishop's commandment", local custom and tradition were everywhere placing checks upon any arbitrary apportionment. Usage varied considerably, but in almost all cases the resources so provided seem to have been expended parochially and not upon the general needs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>It was in the ninth century particularly that not only in the matter of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> but in the revenues of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> a general apportionment began to be arrived at. Both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had now become great personages, maintaining a certain state which could not be kept up without considerable expenditure. The common expenses of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> tended more and more to become the private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Disputes naturally arose, and before long there came a division of these resources. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shared the revenues with the chapter and separate establishments, or <em>mens&aelig;,</em> were created. Similarly the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> lived apart from his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and in a large measure the two systems became mutually independent. Naturally in the case of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters the process of division went further and although the chapters still held <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in common and administered it through a steward, or "&oelig;conomus", each of the canons in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> acquired a separate <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a>, the administration of which was left entirely in his hands. The same freedom was gradually conceded to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priests and other members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, once they had duly been put in possession of their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. To all intents and purposes it might be said that in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or vicar, had succeeded, so far as concerned the limits of his own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, to the administrative <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> formerly exercised by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Still the old <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that all church property was the "patrimony of the poor" was not lost sight of. In theory always, and most commonly in practice, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> collected the revenues of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and other dues and offerings in trust for the poor of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, reserving only what was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his own reasonable support and for the maintenance of the church and its services. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> there was a general and well-understood rule that the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> kept the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> of the church in repair, while the parishioners were bound to see that the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and the rest of the fabric was maintained in proper condition (see Bishop Quivil's "Exeter Decrees", cap. ix; Wilkins, "Concilia", II, 138). The long-protracted process of division and adjustment which led up to the comparatively stable and well-defined ownership of church property in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was also, as might be expected, fertile in abuses. The impropriation of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> set an example which unscrupulous and powerful <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were not slow to follow, with more or less pretence of respecting the forms of law. Great landowners assuming patronal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> situated within their domains named themselves or other secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and seized the revenues which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> separately enjoyed, while the patrons, or <em>advocati,</em> of individual <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches were continually attempting to make <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> compacts with those whom they proposed to present to such <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. But there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that from the eleventh century onwards the more centralized government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as well as the marked progress made in the study of canon law, did much to check these abuses even during the worst times of the Great Schism.
<h2>Acquisition</h2>

<p>Turning from early history to questions of principle we find it laid down by the canonists that as regards the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stands on the same footing as any corporation or any private individual. There is nothing in the nature of things to prevent her from receiving legacies or gifts either of movable or immovable goods, and she may also allow her possessions to grow by investments, by occupation, by prescription, or by the emoluments resulting from any legitimate form of contract. Indeed if the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> interferes substantially with the freedom of collecting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and receiving donations the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are thereby invaded. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which were enacted in the latter part of the thirteenth century both in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to check the passing of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> into <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">"mortmain"</a> were for this reason always regarded as wrong in principle, though the loss occasioned to the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord by the cessation of reliefs, escheats, wardships, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, etc., when the land was made over to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> uses could not be denied. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> was in practice acquiesced in while licenses to acquire land in <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a> were obtainable without great difficulty upon adequate compensation being made (this was known in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as the <em>droit d'amortisation,</em> see Viollet, "Institutions politiques", II, 398-413), but the restrictions thus imposed were never accepted in principle. Such <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pronouncements as the "Clericis laicos" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> claimed that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> possessed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by the donations of the faithful independently of any interference on the part of the State and that if compensation was made it should be done through the free action of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in whom the dominion of all church goods ultimately rested, acting in willing response to any reasonable representations that might be addressed to it.

<p>Later on and especially since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in countries where no state provision or endowment exists for the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, custom, generally endorsed by the enactments of <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> and the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, has introduced besides certain traditional <em>jura,</em> or <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, for spiritual services various exceptional methods of adding to the slender resources of the missions or stations. Such are for example bench-rents or charges for more advantageous seats, collections, charity sermons, and out-door collections made from house to house. At the same time the dangers of abuse in this direction are jealously watched. It is particularly insisted upon that there should be a sufficiency of free seats to allow the poor readily to discharge the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of attending Sunday Mass. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are charged to see that bazaars and entertainments got up for church purposes are not an occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. In particular any refusal of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the sick and dying on the ground of a neglect to contribute to the support of the mission is severely condemned. So also are certain unseemly methods of soliciting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, as for example when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> quits the altar during the celebration of Mass to go round the church to make the collection himself or when promises of Masses and other spiritual favours in return for contributions are conspicuously made in the advertisement sheets of public journals or when the names of particular singers are placarded as soloists in the music performed at <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions (cf. Laurentius, "Juris eccles. inst.", 640). In the past certain definite forms of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were recognized as the ordinary sources through which the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were acquired. A word may be said upon some of the more noteworthy of these.
<h3 id="A">Firstfruits</h3>

<p>The offering of <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> which we meet in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#vrs16">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="../bible/exo034.htm#vrs22">34:22</a>; <a href="../bible/deu026.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 26:1-11</a>) seems to have been taken over as a traditional means of contributing to the support of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It is mentioned in the "Didache", the "Didascalia", "Apostolic Constitutions", etc., but though for a while it was customary to make some similar contributions in kind at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass (a late mention may be found in the Council of Trullo in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concilia", XI, 956) still the practice gradually fell into disuse or took some other form, e.g. that of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, more particularly perhaps the "small tithes", sometimes known as "altalage".
<h3 id="B">Tithes</h3>

<p>This also was an <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> ordinance (see <a href="../bible/deu014.htm#vrs22">Deuteronomy 14:22-7</a>) which many believe to have been identical in origin with <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>. Like the latter due, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were probably taken over by the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> at least in some districts, e.g. <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. They are mentioned in the "Didascalia" and the "Apostolic Constitutions", but there is very little to show that the payment was at first regarded as of strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Still less can we be certain that there was continuity between the usage referred to in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> of the fourth century and the institution which, as already mentioned above, we find described by the Council of M&#226;con in 585. (See <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">T<font size=-2>ITHES</font></a>).
<h3 id="C">Dues</h3>

<p><em>Dues,</em> rather ill-defined and still imperfectly understood, which were known to the Anglo-Saxons as "church-shot". We meet them first in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of King Ine in 693, but they continued throughout all the Anglo-Saxon period and later. This is commonly considered to have been a contribution not paid according to the wealth and quality of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> paying it, but according to the value of the house in which he was living in the winter and identical with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> dues (<em>cathedraticum</em>) of a later age (see Kimble, "Saxons in England", II, 559 sq.). Other dues equally difficult to identify with exactness were the "light-shot" and the "soul-shot". Thus we find among the canons passed at Eynsham in 1009 such an ordinance as the following: "Let <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> be paid every year duly and carefully, i.e. plough-alms 15 nights after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of young by Pentecost and of all fruits of the earth by All Hallows Mass (Nov. 1). And the Rome-fee by Peter's Mass (Aug. 1). And the Church-shot at St. Martins Mass (Nov. 11) and light-shot thrice a year, and it is most just that the men pay the soul-shot at the open grave."
<h3 id="D">Funeral dues</h3>

<p>The last-mentioned contribution of "soul-shot", the precise signification of which is imperfectly understood, is typical of a form of offering which at many different epochs has been a recognized source of income to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even if we look upon the payments to certain clerks prescribed by Justinian (Novel., lix) as a fee for a material service rendered, rather than an offering to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, still from the time of the Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (can. xxi in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, IX, 779) in 563, such money contributions though quite <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> were constantly made in connexion with funerals. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the mortuary in the case of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of knightly dignity commonly took the form of his war-horse with all its trappings. The horse was led up the church at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> and presented at the <a href="../cathen/01356c.htm">altar rails</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it was afterwards sold or redeemed for a money payment.
<h3 id="E">Ordination dues and other offerings in connexion with the sacraments</h3>

<p>Just as it is recognized that Mass stipends, supposing the conditions to be observed which custom and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority prescribe, may be accepted without <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, so at almost all periods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> history offerings have been made in connexion with the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. One of the commonest of these was the payment made to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the newly-ordained at the time of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Though in the end prohibited by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, de ref., cap. i), such offerings had been customary from quite early ages. In some localities a payment was made at the time of the annual confession, but the dangers of abuse in this case were obvious and many <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> condemned the practice. Less difficulty was felt in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and matrimony and the exaction of such dues from those who can afford it may almost be described as general in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h3 id="F">Investments and landed property</h3>

<p>But the most substantial source of revenue, and one that in view of the precarious nature of all other offerings may be considered as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> well-being, is land, or in more modern times investments bearing interest. Even before the toleration edict of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (313), it is clear from the restitution there spoken of that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must have owned considerable landed possessions, and from that time forward donations and legacies of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> yielding annual revenues naturally multiplied. As already pointed out, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to receive such donations whether by will or <em>inter vives</em> was repeatedly acknowledged and confirmed. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it was usual by way of symbolical investiture, by which possession was given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to lay some material object upon the altar, for example a book, or parchment deed, or a ring, or most frequently of all a knife. This knife was often broken by the donor before it was laid upon the altar (see Reichel, "Church and Church Endowments" in "Transactions of the Devonshire Association", XXXIX, 1907, 377-81).

<p>The modern exponents of the canon law, basing their teaching on the pronouncements of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the decrees of <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, lay great stress upon the principle that the offerings of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are to be expended according to the intention of the donors. They also insist that where that intention is not clearly made known certain reasonable presumptions must be followed; for example in missionary centres where a church has not yet been built and organized donations are presumed to be made in view of the ultimate erection of such a church. So again money given at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> in any quasi-parochial church, or collected by the faithful from house to house is not to be considered as a personal gift to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in charge but as intended for the support of the mission. Certain difficult questions which arise with regard to such contributions of the faithful in places where <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are undertaken by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are legislated for in the Constitution <a href="../cathen/13154b.htm">"Romanos Pontifices"</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 8 May, 1881.
<h2>Foundations</h2>

<p>By these are understood a transference of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or to some particular <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institute in view of some service or work to be done either perpetually or for a long time. They are not valid until they are formally accepted, and for that purpose they have to be approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and for all institutions under their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. It is for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to decide whether the endowment is sufficient for the charge, but the foundation once made, especially when the interests of a third party are involved, the conditions cannot ordinarily be changed, at least without appeal to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In particular where a charge of Masses to be said has been accepted, and the foundation no longer meets that charge, application must be made to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> before the number can be reduced.
<h2>Alienation</h2>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to alienate ecclesiastical property follows as a consequence of the complete ownership by which she holds it, and for the same reason in the exercise of this right she is entirely independent of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. Still as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is only a <em>persona moralis,</em> she is in the position of a minor, and disposes of her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> through her <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and administrators. No one of these, not even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, has the power to alienate ecclesiastical property validly, without some proportionate reason (Wernz, "Jus Decret.", III, i, 170). Further, the alienation, which in accordance with numberless decrees and canons of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (see the second part of the Decret., C. xii, q. 2, canons 20, 41, 52) is thus forbidden, comprehends not only the transference of the ownership of church goods but also all proceedings by which the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is burdened, e.g., by mortgages, or lessened in value or exposed to the risk of loss, or by which its revenues are for any notable time diverted from their proper uses. It is to this inalienability of all the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which like the "hand of a dead man" never loosens its grip of what it once has clutched, that the prejudice already referred to against <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> held in <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">"mortmain"</a> grew up in the thirteenth century.

<p>Still the prohibition of alienation is not absolute. It is prohibited only when done without just reason and without the requisite formalities. As "just reasons" the canonists recognize: (1) urgent necessity, for example, when a church is in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and has no other means of raising the money needed; (2) manifest utility, such as may occur when an opportunity presents itself of acquiring a much-desired piece of land on exceptionally advantageous terms; (3) <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, e.g., if church goods are sold to ransom captives or to feed the starving poor; and (4) convenience, as in the case when the upkeep of certain possessions involves more trouble than they are worth. Besides a just reason, there is required, for the alienation of immovable goods (such as lands, houses, stock and other titles and rent-bearing investments) and movable goods of value, the observance of certain formalities. We may enumerate: (1) the preliminary discussion (<em>tractatus</em>), e.g., between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter; (2) the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in those matters in which it is required; (3) a formal mandate for the act of alienation issued by competent authority, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> if he is empowered to do this; (4) the formal consent of interested parties and in many cases of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter.

<p>Finally, the important constitution "Ambitios&aelig;" of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, 7 Sept., 1624, and by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the Constitution "Apostolic&aelig; Sedis", 12 Oct., 1869, requires under penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the alienation of immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of great value. At one time it was contended that the Constitution "Ambitios&aelig;" had fallen into desuetude, but most canonists hold that in the face of the "Apostolic&aelig; Sedis" this cannot now be maintained (see e.g., Wernz, III, n. 165, S&#228;gm&uuml;ller, 879). Still the requirements of the "Ambitios&aelig;" are much mitigated in practice by the faculties commonly conceded to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for ten years at a time to authorize the alienation of church property up to a not inconsiderable amount. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1864) laid down that all acts of alienation or any equivalent disposition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> involving a sum greater than $5000 required <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permission, the consent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors having been previously obtained. But, as the Plenary Council of Latin-America in 1899 (n. 870) also points out, "much depends on circumstances of time and place in deciding what ought to be regarded as <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of small value (<em>valor exigua</em>), hence in this matter a decision to meet the case ought to be obtained by each country separately from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>."

<p>It will be readily understood that all forms of hypothecation or the raising of money upon the security of church property must be regarded as subject to the same conditions as alienation. In cap. iii, X, de pign. iii, 21, the "Corpus Juris" has preserved a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> and deciding that in a case where the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest had pawned a silver <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and a <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and had died before redeeming them, his heirs were to be compelled under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to recover and restore the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the church to which it belonged.
<h2>Prescription</h2>

<p>With regard to prescription, also, ecclesiastical property has special privileges. Amongst private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> the canon law recognized that possession with an unchallenged title for ten, twenty, or at most thirty years suffices to confer ownership, but in the case of immovable church property forty years are required, and against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> one hundred years. As to the much controverted question regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> owner (<em>subjectum dominii</em>) of ecclesiastical property, the more approved view at the present day looks upon each institution as the proprietor of the goods belonging to it, but always in subordination to the supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> vested in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (Wernz, "Jus Decretalium", III, n. 138). As Wernz forcibly argues, if the Universal Church were itself the proprietor it would also be bound by all the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> by which any and every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution was burdened. But neither the Universal Church nor the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> have ever admitted such an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, neither have they ever declared that one institution was liable for the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> incurred by another. At the same time, if the aim and purpose of any particular <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution comes to an end, and its moral <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> is destroyed, its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> passes by right to the ownership of the Universal Church, of which the institution in question was by supposition a member or part. Further, since it is in virtue of its connexion with the Universal Church that the right of acquiring and owning <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belongs to any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, it is commonly held that if it revolt from the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it has no longer any claims to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which it originally acquired for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> purposes as a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Upon the principle that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, as such, has neither the supreme dominion nor any just control over the administration of ecclesiastical property, except in so far as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> or other agreements may freely concede certain powers to the State, all approved writers within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are agreed. Neither can there be any question that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXII, de ref., cap. ii), upheld by the Constitution "Apostolic&aelig; Sedis" of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, which pronounces an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and other censures against the usurpers of church goods, is still in full vigour. It must be plain, then, that the recent wholesale confiscations in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and other countries, have given rise to a vast number of very difficult questions as to the extent to which those who in various ways have participated in these confiscations are subject to the censures pronounced against the usurpers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> goods. The position of those who participate in the act of spoliation by aid, counsel, or favour, in the case of the ecclesiastical property of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal states</a>, is different from those who co-operate in the same way elsewhere. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Respicientes" of 1 Nov., 1870, dealing with the former class clearly extends the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to all who co-operate, whereas in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and elsewhere offenders fall only under the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by this, those who merely take part in the liquidation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, or act as clerks, for instance, in the proceedings, do not seem to incur the censures, but only those who are the actual spoliators and usurpers of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or those who order and plan it; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> affects, in other words, the principals and not those who are merely accessories. The question of the application of these censures is very fully discussed, amongst other recent authorities, by Card. Gennari (Consultations, I) and by the Abb&eacute; Boudinhon in the "Canoniste Contemporain" (March, 1909-Oct., 1910).

<p>Apart from such determined acts of spoliation as those which followed the occupation of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1870) and the recent Associations and Separation Laws in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are generally instructed to comply, as far as may be possible without sacrifice of principle, with the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, if only in the interest of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of which they are the administrators. These and similar points are dwelt upon in the Decrees of the Second Plenary Council of Westminster (1885), which dealt at some length with the question of ecclesiastical property. For example, the Fathers of the Council direct that "no administrator of a mission should draw up any legal document concerning church property, without the express authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who will not fail to consult lawyers most skilled in these matters, and subject everything to the most careful revision". So, too, it directs that "all buildings belonging to a mission should be most carefully insured against fire", and lays down rules as to the destination of Mass offerings, stole fees (<em>jura stola</em>), etc.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> some similar regulations were made in the Maynooth Synod of 1875, and we may note how the synod, after directing that a two-fold inventory of church property should be made, one copy to be kept by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives and the other to be kept among the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> records, lays down the following wise rules respecting the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>: "Lest ecclesiastical property fall into other hands on account of the defects of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will take heed that the titles or deeds may be accurately drawn up according to the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> and in the name of three or four trustees (<em>curatorum</em>). The trustees are to be the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest or other whose <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is concerned, the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> or other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, prudent, well known for uprightness, and for being versed in matters of this sort. These trustees should meet once a year, so as to provide for the security of the aforesaid goods. And if one of them die the others are bound to appoint another in his place. All <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having possession or administration in any way of such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> are bound to make their wills, and these wills are to be kept by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and to no one in <em>in extremis</em> will the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> be given unless he makes his will or promises to do so."
