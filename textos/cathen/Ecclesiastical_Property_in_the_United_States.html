<h1>Ecclesiastical Property in the United States</h1>  

<p>The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> decreed (tit. IX, cap. i, n. 264): "We must hold, holily and inviolably, that the complete right of ownership and dominion over <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods resides in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." In English-speaking countries, however, the State as a rule does not recognize this inherent right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but claims for itself the supreme dominion over temporal possessions. "The State refuses to recognize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as an actual corporation with the power of holding <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in her own name; hence the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> deals only with specific <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>" (<a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, op. cit. infra, p. 310). The fathers of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> say on this subject:

<blockquote><p>On account of the grave dangers to which temporal goods are often exposed when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not allowed to control them according to the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is much to be regretted that in many parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning the possession and administration of temporal goods rest upon principles which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot admit without departing from the rule which she has always held from the time when she first became free to put her religious principles into practice. (tit. IX, cap. ii, n. 266)</p></blockquote>

<p>The many painful incidents arising in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from insecure methods of holding <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> (schism, usurpation of church goods, etc.) caused the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to make stringent rules for safeguarding <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions. Dissensions frequently arose owing to the abuse of power by lay trustees (see <a href="../cathen/15071b.htm">TRUSTEE SYSTEM</a>), in whose name the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was often held.

<p>The various councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> endeavoured to find a remedy for this deplorable state of things. The First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> (n. 5) declared that no church should be erected or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> unless (where possible) it had first been deeded to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>instrumento scripto assignata</em>). Administrators of temporal goods were exhorted to observe the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. The Third <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> (n. 43) says: "We admonish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and all others who have care of movable or immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> given for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> uses, to take measures as soon as possible to secure the carrying out of the intentions of the donors, according to the safest method prescribed by the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in the various States." The Fourth Council adds (n. 56): "that if this security can be obtained in no other way, then the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is to be handed on by means of last wills and testaments, drawn up according to the provisions of the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>". In 1840 <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should make some fellow-bishop his heir, and that, on the death or resignation of the former, the latter should then hand over the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This condition was not, however, to be expressed in the testament, but signified in writing to the chosen heir who was then to burn the letter. The fathers of the Fifth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> asked for a modification of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of various states would make it difficult of execution; they desired that each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, within three months after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, should make a will and deposit a duplicate of it with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (n. 59). The First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> occupied itself with the vexed question of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, decreeing: "We warn <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who administer churches, the title to which has been given to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, not to constitute lay-trustees without episcopal sanction, or permit them to be elected by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, lest an impediment arise to their free administration" (n. 94). In like manner, the Second Plenary Council made new decrees concerning <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. The Fathers of this council seem to have been hopeful that the prescriptions of canon law would find free play in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. They say

<blockquote><p>In these <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> it is the right of all citizens to live freely according to the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of their religion, and as the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> recognize and declare the same, it seems that there is no obstacle to the exact observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> decreed by councils and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> for the legitimate acquisition and preservation of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, the Fathers desire, therefore, that the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be vindicated in the eyes of all and publicly before the State, so that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> may be allowed to observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in acquiring, holding and preserving <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods, such as lands for church edifices, presbyteries, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, cemeteries etc. This complete liberty, however, can be said to exist only when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are recognized by the civil tribunals and thus receive civil effect. By such provisions the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of all will be preserved, possible abuses will be obviated, and the power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, instead of being increased, will rather be diminished by the regulations made by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself. For, at present, in order to obtain protection from the improper interference of lay tribunals, which in practice scarcely acknowledge the ecclesiastical laws, nothing now remains to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for carrying out <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decrees</a> but to claim for themselves the fullest administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> before the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. As, however, church regulations are not acknowledged as yet in some States, it is our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to see that in those places where no provision has been made by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, the impediments to the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the security of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> be removed or diminished. (tit. IV, cap. i, nn. 199, 200)</p></blockquote>

<p>The council then lays down regulations regarding lay trustees.

<p>The Third Plenary Council (tit. IX, cap. ii, nn. 267-8) defined more exactly what was meant by secure methods of ownership according to <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, directing that: <ul><li>(1) The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself be constituted a corporation sole for possessing and administering the goods of the whole diocese; or <li>(2) that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> hold the goods in trust in the name of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; or <li>(3) that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> hold and administer the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in his own name (in fee simple) by an absolute and full legal title.</ul>

<p>In the last case, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to remember that, though before the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> he is the absolute owner, yet by the sacred canons he is only <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. By whichever title the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> holds the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, he is to keep inventories, carefully distinguishing between the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and his own personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Since the Third Plenary Council the question of holding <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> has more than once been discussed by the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and at the present time, in addition to the fee simple and the corporation sole methods, a modified system of the trustee method has found considerable favour. Concerning this, the "St. Paul Catholic Bulletin", says (I, no. 20):

<blockquote><p>Not only is it not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the archbishops (at their meeting in 1911) discouraged the holding of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> by local churches, but on the contrary, they declared it to be the very best solution of the problem under consideration. And while in some States, owing to peculiar legislative enactments, other methods of holding <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> are in vogue, yet it was admitted by the assembled <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> that the holding of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> by local <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> corporations was by far the safest method. In the <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">Archdiocese of St. Paul</a>, each church is incorporated separately and independently of all others. Members of this corporation are ex-officio the Ordinary of the Diocese, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, who select two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to represent the congregation. In addition to these separate <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> corporations, there is a general <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> corporation known as "The Diocese of St. Paul", in which is invested the control of all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, not directly controlled by the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> corporations.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are fully observed, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> exercises sufficient control over all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; without him, the other members of the corporation can take no action binding in law, and he assumes no unreasonable <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> inasmuch as he himself is powerless to act without the consent and co-operation of the others. Dr. P. A. Baart ("Catholic Fortnightly Review", XIV, no. 4) says:

<blockquote><p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, whose decision and <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> were approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, has declared that the corporation system which recognizes the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is preferable to the fee simple tenure by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> before the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>.</p></blockquote>
