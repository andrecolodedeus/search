<h1>Ecclesiastical Province</h1>  

<p>The name given to an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administrative district under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Ecclesiastical provinces first assumed a fixed form in the Eastern Roman Empire. The more important centres (e.g. Antioch for <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Ephesus for the Province of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, Alexandria for <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), whence <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries issued to preach the Gospel, were regarded as the mother-churches of the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities. From the second half of the second century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the territories within the same natural geographical boundaries were accustomed to assemble on important occasions for common counsel in <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. From the end of that century the summons to attend these increasingly important <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> was usually issued by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the capital of the state province (eparchy), who also presided over the assembly, especially in the East. Important communications were also forwarded to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the provincial capital to be brought to the notice of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Thus in the East during the third century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the provincial <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> came gradually to occupy a certain superior position, and received the name of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) this position of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> was taken for granted, and was made the basis for conceding to him definite <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the state province. In Eastern canon law since the fourth century (cf. also the Synod of Antioch of 341, can. ix), it was a principle that every civil province was likewise a church province under the supreme direction of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, i.e. of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the provincial capital. This division into ecclesiastical provinces did not develop so early in the Western Empire. In North Africa the first <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> appears during the fourth century, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> being recognized as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Northern Africa; <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of the separate provinces gradually appear, although the boundaries of these provinces did not coincide with the divisions of the empire. A similar development was witnessed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The migration of the nations, however, prevented an equally stable formation of ecclesiastical provinces in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> West as in the East. It was only after the fifth century that such gradually developed mostly in accordance with the ancient divisions of the Roman Empire. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> alone, on account of the central <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> position of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, this development was slower. However, at the end of antiquity the existence of church provinces as the basis of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration was fairly universal in the West. In the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period they were reorganized, and have retained their place till the present day. The delimitation of church provinces is since the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a right reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. There have always been, and are today, individual <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> which do not belong to any province, but are directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. For the present boundaries of ecclesiastical provinces see articles on the various countries. (See <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">METROPOLITAN</a>.)
