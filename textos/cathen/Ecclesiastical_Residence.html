<h1>Ecclesiastical Residence</h1>  

<p>A remaining or abiding where one's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> lie or where one's occupation is properly carried on, as the presence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or incumbent in his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, a canon in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or collegiate church; opposed to non-residence or absence. Residence is intended to guarantee service or fulfillment of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. In the canonical import of the term a merely material abiding in a place is not sufficient; vigilance and solicitude must accompany it; a laborious residence alone satisfies the requirements. Residence for this reason differs from domicile, and secondly because the intention of remaining is involved in the definition of domicile. It may be noted that by a fiction of law one who is lawfully absent fulfils the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of residence; while, on the contrary, one unlawfully absent is considered to be present; thus one who leaves his own diocese under censure or precept, or purposely and solely (<em>in fraudem legis</em>) to obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in a reserved case, is considered present. Residence is binding on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> holding <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Originally this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> was attached to all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, but through universal custom simple <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or those without the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> do not require personal residence. A canon's presence does not necessarily extend to all hours of the day, while that of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, on the contrary, is continuous, owing to the numerous, and oft-times sudden, demands for his ministrations. A canon is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> ordinarily to dwell in close proximity to his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. It suffices that he be able conveniently to be present at the prescribed hours.

<p>Residence, in connexion with the pastoral office, is inculcated in various canons. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, c. 1, de ref.) says: "Since by Divine precept it is enjoined on all to whom the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> is entrusted to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their own sheep, to offer sacrifice for them, to feed them by preaching the Divine word, by the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and by the example of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, likewise to have a fatherly care of the poor and other distressed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and to apply themselves to all other pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; all which offices can not be rendered and fulfilled by those <em>who neither watch over nor are with their own flock,</em> but abandon it after the manner of hirelings, the sacred synod admonishes and exhorts such that, mindful of the Divine precept and made a pattern of the flock, they feed and rule in judgment and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>". A <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> then is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to dwell in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; and, generally speaking, by reason of local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence or rectory. Because of greater responsibilities resting upon them, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> insists that <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or others in charge of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> or quasi-dioceses, even though they be <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, live within their own territory, though not of necessity in the episcopal city. Bishops, moreover, are admonished by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> not to be absent from their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, unless their episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> call them elsewhere in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, and <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, on which days especially the sheep ought to be refreshed and rejoice in the Lord at the presence of the shepherd. The <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chancery office</a>, the official centre of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> business, will be found more properly at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, even though the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> reside elsewhere. The six <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal bishops</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">C<font size=-2>ARDINAL</font></a>) whose sees are in proximity to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are permitted to dwell in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, while suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> administer their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (const. Clem. XVI, "Pastorale officium"; const. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, "Apostolic&aelig; Romanorum Pontificum", 15 Apr., 1910).

<p>Some maintain that the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of residence is incumbent on <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by virtue of Divine as well as ecclesiastical law. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not see fit to settle this controversy (cf. Bened. XIV, "De syn.", L. 7, c. 1). It would seem that while the canons demand a personal fulfillment of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, the Divine precept is satisfied if the work be done even by others, though this is less fitting. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of residence is not to be applied so strictly as not to admit of absence at times. In some cases a reasonable or just cause of absence, e.g. <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> rest, legitimate recreation, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, a visit to relatives or friends, business matters, suffices; in others, a grave reason is required. Grave reasons for absence may be reduced to two. The first is urgent necessity, e.g. when one is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by ill health to seek change of climate, called away in obedience to a lawful superior, attendance at an &oelig;cumenical council, making the prescribed <em>ad limina</em> visit. The second reason is charity in a marked degree, e.g. the prosecution of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the promotion of peace among nations. For no cause should a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> his people in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, pestilence, or on other occasions when their welfare is seriously menaced. The period of absence allowed may be continuous or interrupted. While the chapter may never be absent, individual members may annually have three months' vacation, if the constitutions of the chapter permit. A sufficient number for the office required must be present. Bishops are counselled not to allow <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or rectors of missions more than two months' leave of absence yearly, unless the reason be urgent. Permission should be given in writing, except for short absences, and a substitute approved by the ordinary, with competent recompense, left in charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Usually <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> permit an absence of a few days without consulting the ordinary. The law allows a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for just cause, when it is possible without detriment to his charge, to absent himself three months annually, though not during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> or <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> or on the feasts enumerated above. For a longer absence, though advantage may not have been taken for years of the period annually allowed, a grave reason is required as well as express permission of the Consistorial Congregation. Clerics other than those mentioned are subject to local regulations, both as regards residence and absence.

<p>Non-residence or unlawful absence is punishable in law. Canons lose all share in the daily distributions unless actually present in choir. Where it is permitted they may use with moderation the privilege of appointing substitutes. Besides being guilty of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and rectors who violate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of residence forfeit the fruits, i.e. salary or income, of their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in proportion to the time of their absence. A certain amount may be retained in recompense for other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> discharged, such as the application of Mass etc. The money forfeited is used in repairing churches or in works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Bishops also lose whatever <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges they possess as assistants to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. Continued infringement of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may be more severely punished, even by deposition. If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is absent more than a year, he must be denounced to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> be thus absent, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of reporting the matter devolves on the senior suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence of one month suffers for the licit contracting of marriage in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (Ne temere, art. 5): the mere fact of thirty days stay, even though by chance, if morally continuous, is sufficient. By such residence one becomes a parishioner as far as marriage is concerned, and although retaining a domicile or quasi-domicile elsewhere, may obtain matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the place of residence. Canonists are not agreed whether this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the case of one who, though living in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for some time, e.g. a week, only in various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, has not acquired a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence of a month. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the previous legislation contemplated a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>, not a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, domicile or quasi-domicile.
