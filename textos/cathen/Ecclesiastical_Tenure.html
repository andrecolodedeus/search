<h1>Ecclesiastical Tenure</h1>  

<p>I. In the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> fief followed all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> laid down for temporal fiefs. The suzerain, e.g. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, or other possessor, granted an estate in perpetuity to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who thereby became his vassal. As such, the grantee at his enfeoffment did homage to his overlord, took an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty, and made offering of the prescribed money or other object, by reason of which he held his fief. These requirements had to be repeated as often as there was a change in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the suzerain or vassal. These fiefs were granted by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> to princes, barons, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, and others, who thereupon assumed the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of protecting the church and domains of the overlord. This system of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tenure was not always restricted to lands, as church revenues and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were often farmed out to secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as a species of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> fief. Strictly speaking, however, a fief was usually defined as immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> whose usufruct perpetually conceded to another under the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of fealty and personal homage. A fief was not <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> simply because its overlord was a churchman; it was requisite also that the domain granted should be <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Lands, which belonged to the patrimony of an ecclesiastic, became a secular fief if he bestowed them on a vassal.

<p>All fiefs were personal and hereditary, and many of the latter could be inherited by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> descent. Fiefs bestowed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on vassals were called active fiefs; when <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> themselves undertook <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to a suzerain, the fiefs were called passive. In the latter case, temporal princes gave certain lands to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by enfeoffing a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and the latter had then to do homage as pro-vassal and undertake all the implied <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. When these included military service, the ecclesiastic was empowered to fulfil this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by a substitute. It was as passive fiefs that many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, abbacies, and prelacies, as to their temporalities, were held of kings in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a>, and the power thereby acquired by secular princes over elections to <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> led to the bitter strife over investitures. These passive fiefs were conferred by the suzerain investing the newly-elected churchman with <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> and ring at the time of his making homage, but the employment of these symbols of spiritual power gradually paved the way to exorbitant claims on the part of the secular overlords (see <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">CONFLICT OF INVESTITURES</a>). Among <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> fiefs were included not merely landed estates, however vast, but also duchies, principalities, and even kingdoms. When the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> enfeoffed a prince, the latter did homage to him as to his liege lord, and acknowledged his vassalage by an annual tribute. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (29 Mar., 1567) decreed that, in future, fiefs belonging strictly to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a> should be incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> whenever the vassalage lapsed, and that no new enfeoffment take place. John, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, declared that he held his realm as a fief from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1213, and James II, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, accepted the same relation for <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> in 1295. The most famous <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> fief was the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, springing from investitures of 1059 and 1269. Modern conditions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> have made impossible any continuance of such <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> relations.

<p>II. As to the tenure by which church lands are now held by legal titles before the civil law, see <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL PROPERTY</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15071b.htm">TRUSTEE SYSTEM</a>.

<p>III. For the perpetual tenure by incumbents of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>, see <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">BENEFICE</a>.
