<h1>Eclecticism</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>ek, legein</em>; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>eligere</em>, to select)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> term meaning either a tendency of mind in a thinker to conciliate the different views or positions taken in regard to problems, or a system in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which seeks the solution of its fundamental problems by selecting and uniting what it regards as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the various <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In the first sense, eclecticism is a characteristic of all the great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, with special development in some, such as Leibniz; an element of the integral method of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> more or less emphasized in the divers <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The term <em>eclectics</em>, however, is properly applied to those who accept Eclecticism as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and fundamental system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. It is with Eclecticism in this strict sense that we are dealing here.

<p>As a rule, in the history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Eclecticism follows a period of scepticism. In presence of conflicting doctrines regarding nature, life, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> despairs of attaining scientific and exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about these important subjects. Eclecticism then aims at constructing a system broad and vague enough to include, or not to exclude, the principles of the divers <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, though giving at times more importance to those of one <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and apparently sufficient to furnish a basis for the conduct of life. In the latter period of Greek philosophy, during the two centuries preceding the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> and the three centuries following, Eclecticism is represented among the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> by Asclepiades of Bithynia; among the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, Panetius of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, (about 180-110 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Posidonius (about 50 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), and later on by the neo-Cynics, Demetrius and Demonax (about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 150); in the New Academy by Philo of <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Larissa</a> (about 80 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) and Antiochus of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a> (died 68 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>); in the Peripatetic School by Andronicus of Rhodes (about 70 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the editor and commentator of the works of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, and later on by Aristocles (about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 180), Alexander of Aphrodisias (about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 200), the physician Galen (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 131-201), Porphyry in the third, and Simplicius in the sixth, century of our era. The eclectic system was, by its character, the one which was best suited to the practical mind of the Romans. With the exception of Lucretius's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, their speculative philosophy was always and altogether eclectic, while <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> dominated in their <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> philosophy. Cicero is, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the best representative of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. His philosophy is a mixture of the scepticism of the Middle Academy with <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> and Peripateticism. The School of the Sextians, with Quintus Sextius (80 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Sotion, and Celsus, was partly <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> and Cynic, partly Pythagorean. Under the empire, Seneca, Epictetus the slave, and the <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Emperor Marcus Aurelius</a> combined the principles of <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> with some doctrines taken from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> School of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in the second and third centuries after Christ, is considered by some as eclectic; but the designation is not exact. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> borrows, indeed, many of its principles from Pythagoreanism, <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>, Peripateticism, and especially from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>; but all these doctrines are dominated by and interpreted according to certain principles of religious <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> which make this <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> an original though <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretic</a> system. The same may be said of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> who take some of their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> principles from the dominant systems, but who are guided in their choice as well as in their interpretation by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian revelation</a>.

<p>In modern times Eclecticism has been accepted in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by Wolff and his disciples. It has received its most characteristic form in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the nineteenth century from Victor Cousin (1792-1867) and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which is sometimes called the <a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">Spiritualistic</a> School. Drawn away from sensualism by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/13213b.htm">Royer Collard</a>, Cousin seeks in the Scottish School a sufficient foundation for the chief metaphysical, moral, and religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. Failing in this attempt, he takes up the different doctrines then current; he is successively influenced by Maine de Biran whom he calls "the greatest metaphysician of our time", by the writings of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, and by personal intercourse with Schelling and <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>; finally, he turns to the works of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Plotinus, and Proclus, only to come back to <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and Leibniz. He then reaches the conclusion that the successive systems elaborated throughout the preceding ages contain the full development of human thought; that the complete <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to be found in a system resulting from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> fusion, under the guidance of common sense, of the fragmentary thoughts expressed by the different thinkers and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of all ages. Four great systems, he says, express and summarize the whole development of human speculation: sensism, <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>, scepticism, and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Each contains a part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; none possesses exclusively the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Human thought cannot invent any new system, nor can it neglect any of the old ones. Not the destruction of any of, but the reduction of all to one, will put us in possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>There is, indeed, something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in Eclecticism. It would be folly for each thinker to deliberately ignore all that has been said and taught before him; such a method would render progress impossible. The experience and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired by past ages is a factor in the development of human thought. The history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is useful; it places at our disposal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> already discovered, and by showing us the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which philosophy has fallen, it guards us against them and against the principles or methods which have caused them. This is the element of value contained in the system. But Eclecticism errs when it substitutes for personal reflection as the primary source of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> a mere fusion of systems, or the history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for philosophy proper. Eclecticism does not furnish us with the ultimate principles of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or the criterion of certitude. We cannot say that philosophy has reached the highest degree of precision either in its solution or in its presentation of every problem; nor that it knows all that can be known about nature, man, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But even if this were the case, the principles of Eclecticism cannot provide us with a firm, complete, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Cousin says that there is some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in ever system; supposing this to be exact, this partial <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as evidently to be acquired at first through principles and a rule of certitude which are independent of Eclecticism. When Cousin declares that there is a mingling of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in every system, he evidently assumes a principle superior and antecedent to the very principle of Eclecticism. The eclectic must first separate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> before building into a system the results of his discrimination. But this is possible only on the condition of passing a judgment upon each of these systems and therefore of having, quite apart from history, some rational principle as an ultimate criterion. In a word, Eclecticism, considered as a study of the opinions and theories of others in order to find in them some help and enlightenment, has its place in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; it is a part of philosophic method; but as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> it is altogether inadequate.
