<h1>Edmond-Frederic Le Blant</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> archeologist and historian, born 12 August, 1818; died 5 July, 1897 at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and having qualified to practice, he obtained in 1843 a situation in the customs under the Finance Board. This position assured his future and he was free to follow his scientific inclinations. During a voyage through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1847) he visited the Kircher Museum, and his intercourse with <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">G.B. de Rossi</a> determined him to undertake in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the scientific work which the founder of <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian archeology</a> had undertaken in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As early as 1848 Le Blant was commissioned to collect the inscriptions of the earliest days of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and like de Rossi, he made an investigation of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, printed books, museums, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and the Gallo-Roinan cemeteries. In 1856 appeared the first volume of his "Recueil des inscriptions chr&eacute;tienne des Gaules ant&eacute;rieures au VIIIe si&egrave;cle". The second volume of the work (Paris, 1865) obtained for its author his election as a member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres. A third volume appeared in 1892 under the title of "Nouveau Recueil". In the course of his researches Le Blant did not overlook any questions raised by his documents. He wrote learned articles on the method of <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian epigraphy</a>, on <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, on the origin, progress, popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, and moral influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in ancient Gaul. When he resigned his post as sub-commissioner of the customs (1872) he continued to devote himself to his favourite studies.

<p>He tried to gather into one "Corpus" the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sarcophagi of which so many have been preserved in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1878 he published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> his "Etudes sur les sarcophages chr&eacute;tiens de la ville d'Arles", which was followed by a second work "Etudes sur les sarcophages chr&eacute;tiens de la Gaule" (Paris, 1886). In the introduction he treats of the form, ornamentation, and iconography of these monuments; he dwells upon the relationship between the sarcophagi of Arles and those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the difference between them and those of the south-west of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in which he finds more distinct signs of local influence. His studies and his personal tastes led him to take an interest also in the history of the persecutions and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. In numerous writings he treats in particular of the judicial bases of the persecutions and the critical value of the Acts of the Martyrs. These studies were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by his fine work "Pers&eacute;cuteurs et Martyrs" (Paris, 1893), in which he displays his scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of history and his deep <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> convictions. In 1883, Le Blant became director of the Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As such, his name figures honourably between that of Geffroy and of Mgr. Duchesne. In addition to his works mentioned above we may mention his collaboration with Jacquemart in "Histoire artistique, industrielle et commerciale de la porcelaine" (Paris, 1862); "Manuel d'&eacute;pigraphie chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1869); "Les Actes des martyrs, Suppl&eacute;ment aux Acta sincera' de Dom Ruinart" (Paris, 1882).
