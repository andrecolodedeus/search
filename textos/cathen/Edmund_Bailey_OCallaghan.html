<h1>Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan</h1>  

<p>Physician, publicist, and historian, b. at Mallow, <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 29 February, 1797; d. at New York, 29 May, 1880. His eldest brother Theodore held a commission in the English army; the others, Eugene and David, became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and were distinguished for their learning. On completing his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Edmund went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1820) to study medicine. In 1830 he settled in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and besides the practice of medicine, took an active part in the National Patriotic movement and in 1834 became the editor of its organ the "Vindicator". Elected to the Provincial Parliament in 1836 he held a conspicuous position in debate for popular <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, took a leading part in the unsuccessful insurrection of 1837, was <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">attainted</a> of treason, fled to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, remained nearly a year the guest of Chancellor Walworth in Saratoga, and in 1838 resumed the practice of medicine in <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, where he edited the "Northern Light", an industrial journal.

<p>The anti-rent agitation of the time led him to study the land-rights of the Patroons. Attracted by the rich but neglected old <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> records in the possession of the State, he mastered the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> language and in 1846 published the first volume of "History of New Netherland", the first real history of New York State. The result of its publication was the official commission of J.R. Brodhead by the New York State Legislature to search the archives of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, Paris, and The Hague, and to make copies of documents bearing on New York colonial history. These documents were published in eleven quarto volumes (1855-61) under the editorship of O'Callaghan and are a monument of care and ability. In 1848 he was made keeper of the historical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> Of New York State, and in this capacity served for twenty-two years. He was the first to call public attention to the value of the Jesuit Relations, and read a paper before the New York Historical Society, giving description of their purpose and scope. James Lenox began to collect the scattered copies and the Lenox Library in New York, contains the only complete set or series of printed Jesuit Relations. The Thwaites edition in seventy-three volumes was based on the Lenox set of the French, Latin and Italian texts. O'Callaghan dedicated to Lenox his "List of the editions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and parts thereof Printed in America Previous to 1860". An edition of this work with annotations by Lenox is in the Lenox Library, New York.

<p>In 1870 O'Callaghan went to New York and assumed the task of editing its municipal records, but through difficulties about financial resources they were never published. Though highly esteemed for his medical learning, O'Callaghan's great claim on the gratitude of posterity is his historical work. The clearness of his style with accuracy of detail gave authority to his writings, which contain a mine of original information about New York colonial history.
