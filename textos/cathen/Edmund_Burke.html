<h1>Edmund Burke</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Nova Scotia, b. in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Maryborough, County Kildare, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1753; d. at <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, 1820. He was compelled by existing political conditions in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to pursue his studies in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where his talents and character gave promise of his future career. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he returned to his native diocese. Here trouble had just arisen over the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and Father Burke was blamed by some partisans for espousing the cause of his superior. The unpleasant conditions led young Burke to follow the advice of Dr. Carpenter, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and go to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He arrived in Quebec in the summer of 1786, and in September of that year was made professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and mathematics in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec. His work in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> led to his appointment as a director of that institution, but he craved for missionary work north and west of the Great Lakes, where, in scattered villages, there were many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had not seen a missionary since the conquest (1759). In 1794 he gained his object and was sent into the missionary field with the title of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> and Superior of the Missions of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. For seven years he laboured faithfully, enduring all the hardships of a pioneer missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and he suffered, too, from lack of sympathy and support in his work. He saw clearly and made known to his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors the loss to religion resulting from race prejudices and misunderstandings. His plain statements made in the cause of religion and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> brought him enemies and many accusations. He met them fearlessly and these trials but prepared him for his important work of the future as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Nova Scotia, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> direction of most of the English-speaking population of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Quebec in 1801, was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Nova Scotia in 1815, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zion in 1818. The work done by this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> for religion, for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and for the State in <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, during the first twenty years of the nineteenth century are fully treated in the work (quoted below) of one of his successors. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian Campbell thus closes his biographical sketch of Bishop Burke: "The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a> in its wide extent has seen few, if any, of its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who died more respected and regretted by all classes; more beloved and idolized by his own flock; and whose memory as a great, enlightened, and liberal-minded <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> is looked up to with so much veneration." His most important writings are "The First Principles of Christianity" and "The Ministry of the Church" (Dublin, 1817).
