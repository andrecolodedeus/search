<h1>Edmund Tanner</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> and Cloyne, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1574-1579; born about 1526; died 1579. The statement in his brief of appointment that he was born in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> is all that is known of his early life. His surname was borne by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> station at Calverstown, Co. Kildare, which, coupled with his familiarity with the Eustaces of Baltinglas, may give colour to a surmise that he was a native of that district. In 1565 he was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being then probably in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; after a year in the Roman College he was sent to Dillingen University in 1567, and became doctor of divinity. His health, however, failed and he left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. In 1574 he was again at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">See of Cork</a> and Cloyne being vacant, he was appointed thereto, 5 November, 1574, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In May, 1575, he set out for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> with exceptional faculties for his own diocese and for those of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> in the absence of their respective <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Not long after his reaching <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he was captured while exercising his functions at Clonmel, and was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; here, as Holing tells, he was visited by a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom he reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A few days later he was himself released through the influence of a noble earl. Thereafter he did not venture into his own diocese but as commissary-Apostolic he traversed the other districts assigned him, administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and discharging in secret the other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office. Four years he laboured thus in continual peril and distress, and at length succumbed to his privations and fatigues in the <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Diocese of Ossory</a>, 4 June, 1579. Bruodin states that he died in Dublin Castle after eighteen months of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and cruel torture.
