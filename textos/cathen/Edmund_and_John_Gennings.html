<h1>Edmund and John Gennings</h1>  

<p>The first, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and the second, the restorer of the English province of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, were brothers and converts to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Edmund Gennings was born at <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a> in 1567; died in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 10 Dec., 1591. John was b. about 1570; d. at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, 12 Nov., 1660.

<p>Edmund, even in his boyhood, exhibited an unusual gravity of manners and a mystical turn of mind; when about sixteen years of age, he was converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and immediately afterwards entered the English College at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1590, being then only twenty-three years of age, and at once returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under the assumed name of Ironmonger. But his missionary career was of short duration, for he was seized whilst saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> on 7 Nov., 1591, and executed at Gray's Inn Fields on 10 Dec. His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was the occasion of several remarkable incidents, chief of which was the conversion of his younger brother John. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Edmund Gennings had at once gone to Lichfield to seek out his kindred in the hope of bringing them to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but he found that all his relatives were dead except this one brother, who had, however, left his native city and gone to London. Thither Edmund proceeded and for a whole month searched the city, visiting every place where he thought his brother might be found. Eventually, when he was about to give up the search, he achieved his purpose, but the younger brother, far from being won over to Edmund's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, only besought him to go away, lest he himself should become suspect; and when after awhile Edmund was seized and condemned John "rejoiced rather than bewailed the untimely and bloody end of his nearest kinsman, hoping thereby to be rid of all persuasions which he suspected he should receive from him touching the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Religion". So wrote John Gennings in his life of his brother, published in 1614 at St-Omer.

<p>Undoubtedly at this time John Gennings was bent on pleasure, but one must make allowances for the spirit of remorse with which he looked back on those days in after years, and not accept his own estimate of his youth too readily. However, about ten days after his brother's execution, a change came over him. He began one night to think of his brother's death and contempt of the world, and to compare his own life with that of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. He was struck with remorse and wept bitterly, and next <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for light. Instantly he felt an exceeding great reverence for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and, above all our Blessed Lady, and it seemed to him that he saw his brother in glory. He thereupon made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to forsake friends and country and seek a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his brother's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Being received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he entered <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1607, and the following year was sent upon the English mission. Here he conceived a desire for the restoration of the English province of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and sought out Father William Staney, the <a href="../cathen/04164b.htm">Commissary</a> of the English <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, and from him received the habit, either in 1610 or 1614 (the date is uncertain). After this, he went for a time to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order at Ypres, in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where he was joined by several English companions, amongst whom was Christopher Davenport, known in religion as Franciscus a Sancta Clara, afterwards a famous controversialist. Thus was the foundation of a new English province laid, and Father William Staney recognising the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of John Gennings, now gave into his hands the seal of the old province of the English Observants.

<p>Gennings next proceeded to procure a house for the English <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> at Gravelines, but in 1618 he obtained leave from the minister general to establish a settlement at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. As a matter of fact, most of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> who had joined Gennings were <em>alumni</em> of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>, and in transferring their residence to that town he hoped to obtain a continuous supply of recruits. The work of restoring the English province was definitely confided to him by the general chapter of 1618, and he was nominated "Vicar of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>". To assist him in the work of restoration, the commissary general of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> nation was empowered to gather together all the English and Scotch <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> from any province in the order. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the same general chapter placed the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> of Gravcelines under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of English <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. In 1625, the number of the English <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> having greatly increased, Gennings sent Father Franciscus a Sancta Clara to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to plead that the English province be canonically established. The request was granted with the simple restriction that the superior of the province should not assume the title of provincial, but that of custos; but in 1629, this restriction was taken away and Friar John Gennings was appointed minister provincial. The first chapter of the new province was held at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> of the same year, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the English sisters of the third order, which Gennings had himself founded in 1619. This community of tertiary sisters has continued to the present time, and is now established at Taunton, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, with a branch house at Woodchester. Father John Gennings was re-elected provincial in 1634, and again in 1643.
