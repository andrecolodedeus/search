<h1>Eduard Von Steinle</h1>  

<p>An historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 2 July, 1810; died at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 19 Sept., 1886. Steinle came successively under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> Kupelweiser, <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius</a>, and was thus introduced into the new and vigorous methods of the German <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> who had formed themselves into a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Steinle went himself several times to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but preferred to work in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He received his first large commission, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Castle of Rheineck, while living at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>; a second one was for work in the Hall of the Emperors (<em>Kaisersaal</em>) at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, where he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the pictures of Albert I and Ferdinand III. These commissions and his friendship with <a href="../cathen/15322a.htm">Philip Veit</a> and the Brentano <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> decided him to take up his permanent residence at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. From 1850 he was professor of historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at the St&auml;del Art Institute of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. Like his friend <a href="../cathen/13598a.htm">Schwind</a> he was one of the last of the great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of the Romantic School and one of those of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> who were largest in their scope. Like <a href="../cathen/13598a.htm">Schwind</a> also he was probably more a master in the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> ordinary subjects. Still Constant von Wurzbach was able to write an appreciation of Steinle with the title "Ein Madonnamaler unserer Zeit" (Vienna, 1879), for Steinle left more than a hundred religious panel pictures, besides numerous cartoons for church windows. He was also regarded as the great master of monumental fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the districts of the Rhine.

<p>Besides his work at Rheineck he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> cycles of pictures in the Castle of Klein-Heubach, in the Church of St. &AElig;gidius at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. He also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the groups of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and did part of the work in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the choir of the Minster at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and in the imperial <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. Nevertheless, however striking these frescoes may be, too much stress is laid on detail, and the large, monumental character essential to such <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is not sufficiently apparent. This lack is still more evident in the frescoes showing the historical development of civilization on the stairway of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum at Cologne. Among Steinle's smaller religious pictures are some very fine ones, as that of the <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> "Madonna holding the Child" while an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> plays a musical instrument in front of them, the "Visitation", the "Holy Family at the Spring", "Mary Magdalen seeking Christ", "Christ Walking with His Disciples", the "Legend of St. Euphrosyne", and the "Great Penitentiary". Steinle was not so willing to condescend to extremes in pleasing popular taste as <a href="../cathen/13598a.htm">Schwind</a>, although he had a keen eye for ordinary life and a sense of humour. He placed the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> presented by the picture prominently in the foreground, so that at times the method of portrayal seems too artificial. Among his noblest and most universally admired <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> that are not directly religious are: the "Warder of the Tower", the "Fiddler", the "Sibyl", the "Lorelei", and the pictures of the story of Parsifal; no less remarkable are his illustrations of <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, and especially those to accompany Brentano's writings. Steinle's works show both graceful and well-defined composition, poetic conception, healthy religious feeling, and, of not less importance, pleasing colour.
