<h1>Edward Anthony Hatton</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>; b. in 1701; d. at Stourton Lodge, near <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, Yorkshire, 23 October, 1783&mdash;according to some authorities, 1781. He was probably the son of Edward Hatton, yeoman, of Great Crosby, Lancashire, who registered his estate as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11099a.htm">non-juror</a> in 1717, and whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> appears in the <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a> rolls for many generations. He received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Bornhem, near <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a>, 25 May, 1722, taking the name in religion of Antoninus. Having filled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of teacher for several years, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and on 7 July, 1730, he left college for the mission work in his own country. He first officiated as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, in turn, to several gentleman in Yorkshire, and in the year 1749 he went to assist <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Father Thomas Worthington, O.P.</a>, at Middleton Lodge, near Leeds. After the latter's death, which occurred on 25 February, 1753 (or 1754), Father Hatton was entrusted with the care of the mission. Shortly afterwards he was compelled to remove the mission to Stourton Lodge, where ultimately he succeeded in having a new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected (1776), but a few miles distant from the of his former labours. Twice was Father Hatton appointed to the office of <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>: on 21 May, 1754&mdash;until the year 1758; his second term of office lasted from 7 May, 1770, till 1774. In 1776 he began the mission at Hunslet, near <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, but did not live long to behold the unfolding of the work he had originated.

<p>His writings include: "Moral and Controversial Lectures upon the Christian Doctrines and Christian Practice (By E.H.)". To this work neither place of publication nor date is assigned. "Memoirs of the Reformation of England; in two parts. The whole collected chiefly from Acts of Parliament and Protestant historians", published (London, 1826; 2nd ed., 1841) under the pseudonym of Constantius Archaeophilus. Hatton is also the author of "Miscellaneous Sermons upon some of the most important Christian Duties and Gospel Truths", 7 vols., <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>
