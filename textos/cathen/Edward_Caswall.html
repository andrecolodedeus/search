<h1>Edward Caswall</h1>  

<p>Oratorian and poet, b. 15 July 1814, at Yately, Hampshire, of which place his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the Rev. R. C. Caswall, was <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicar</a>; d. at the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">Oratory</a>, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, 2 January, 1878. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Marlborough Grammar School and at Brasenose College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he was Hulme exhibitioner. Before leaving Oxford he published, under the pseudonym of Scriblerus Redivivus, "The Art of Pluck", in imitation of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, a witty satire upon the ways of the careless college student, which still has a circulation. To the eighth edition, in 1843, he wrote a special preface of regret for certain passages, now excluded, which, at that later date, he had come to regard as irreverent. In 1838 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and in 1839 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. In 1840 he became perpetual <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Stratford-sub-Castle in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of his uncle, Dr. Burgess, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. In 1846 he published "Sermons on the Seen and the Unseen", a volume of thoughtful discourses marked by the same tender and fervent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> found in his well-known <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and by a clear leaning to certain elements of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. Soon afterwards, having come under the influence of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> (then Dr.) <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and the "Tracts for the Times", he resigned his curacy and, in January, 1847, was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Cardinal Acton at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1849 Caswall's wife, who had also become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, died suddenly of cholera, and early in 1850 he became an Oratorian. In 1852 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and lived at the Oratory until his death. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Rednal, in the private <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemetery</a> of the congregation, near the grave of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>. Besides various manuals of devotion, several of which he translated from the French, his principal works are: "Lyra Catholica", a translation of all the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> with some others (often reprinted; last edition, London, 1884); "The Masque of Mary and other Poems", original poetry, thoughtful, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a>, tender, and full of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a book which drew from <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>, in return, a remarkable poem addressed to the author (reprinted several times; last edition, London, 1887); "The Catholic's Latin Instructor in the principal Church offices and devotions" (frequently reprinted; last edition, London, 1897).
