<h1>Edward Maginn</h1>  

<p>Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04742a.htm">Derry</a>, b. at Fintona, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 16 Dec., 1802; d. at <a href="../cathen/04742a.htm">Derry</a>, 17 January, 1849, the son of Patrick Maginn, a farmer, and his wife, Mary Slevin, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> gave many distinguished <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church in the eighteenth century. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his uncle, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Monaghan, and later by Thomas MacColgan, at Buncrana, Donegal, and entered the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, Paris, in 1818. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1825 at <a href="../cathen/04742a.htm">Derry</a>, and was soon appointed <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Moville, where he remained till 1829, labouring with great fruit and winning renown as a preacher. He opposed energetically the efforts made by the Episcopalian body to proselytize his flock, and took a prominent part in a public controversy held at Derry concerning <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a>, a report of which was published later in book form (Dublin, 1828). In 1829 he became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Fahan, and applied himself to the suppression of agrarian <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, while appealing to the Government to protect the peasantry against the abuse of power by the local non-Catholic magistrates. He was one of the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> advocates of Catholic Emancipation, supported O'Connell in the Repeal movement, and endeavoured to heal the breach between the young Irelanders and the Liberator. Though recognizing the glaring defects of the "national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>" system he accepted it, and by his protests prevented the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> control. He repudiated the Queen's Colleges, helped to bring about their condemnation at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and enthusiastically advocated the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which, however, he did not live to see. On 18 Jan., 1846, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11330c.htm">Orthosia</a> and coadjutor to Dr. MacLaughlin of Derry. Seized with typhus fever on 14 Jan., 1849, he expired three days later in St. Columb's College and was buried at Buncrana, Donegal. Dr. Maginn was an important factor in the rehabilitation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Ulster after Emancipation; he devoted himself, moreover, to the temporal welfare of the peasants, and his letters on land and the Poor Law administration, together with his evidence before the Devon Commission (Report published at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 1847), contain valuable information on the social condition of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the first half of the nineteenth century. The gross incompetency and partiality of the government officials during the famine of 1847-49 inspired him with an abhorrence of English misrule. Not the least useful of his writings was a series of letters in reply to Lord Stanley, who in the House of Lords, 23 Nov., 1847, had accused the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of using the confessional to encourage lawlessness and crime ("Refutation of Lord Stanley's Calumnies against the Catholic Clergy of Ireland", reprint, Dublin, 1850).
