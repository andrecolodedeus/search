<h1>Edward McCabe</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 1816; died at Kingstown, 11 February, 1885; he was the son of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Father Doyle's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> on the Quays and at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1839. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he served successively as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in Clontarf and at the pro-cathedral, Marlborough St. in Dublin; and such was the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy he displayed, joined to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> capabilities far beyond the ordinary, that he was selected, in 1854, for the See of Grahamstown in South Africa. He was reluctant, however, to take upon himself the burden of the episcopate in an unknown land, and in 1856 became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Nicholas Without, in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. In 1865 he was transferred to the more important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Kingstown, and became a member of the chapter and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. For the twelve following years his was the ordinary life of a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, hard-working <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, ambitious of nothing but to serve the spiritual and temporal needs of his people. <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> had always held him in the highest esteem, and when, in 1877, the burden of years compelled him to seek assistance he selected Dr. McCabe, who was in due course <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06332a.htm">Gadara</a>. The following year <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> died, and in 1879 Dr. McCabe became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. Three years later he received the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. These were troubled times in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the years of the Land League and of the National League, of violent agitation and savage coercion, when <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> were strong in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and the Phoenix Park <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> and many others of less note were committed. Like his predecessor, Cardinal McCabe had a distrust of popular movements. Brought up in the city, he was unacquainted with agrarian conditions and unable to appreciate the wrongs which the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> tenants suffered, and he too readily identified with the political movement under Parnell and Davitt the many outrages committed by the people. In pastorals and public speeches he ranged himself against agitation and on the side of government and law, with the result that Nationalist newspapers and publicmen attacked him as a "Castle" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who favoured coercion and was an enemy of the people. His life was threatened and for a time he was under the protection of the police.
