<h1>Edward Rishton</h1>  

<p>Born in Lancashire, 1550; died at Sainte-M&eacute;nehould, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, 29 June, 1585. He was probably a younger son of John Rishton of Dunkenhalgh and Dorothy Southworth. He studied at Oxford from 1568 to 1572, when he proceeded <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a> probably from Brasenose College. During the next year he was converted and went to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was the first Englishman to matriculate at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and is said to have taken his M.A. degree there. While a student he drew up and published a chart of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, and was one of the two sent to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in November, 1576, to see if the college could be removed there. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (6 April, 1576) he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1580 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, visiting <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> on the way, but was soon arrested. He was tried and condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> with <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a> and others on 20 November, 1581, but was not executed, being left in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, first in King's Bench, then in the Tower. On 21 January he was exiled with several others, being sent under escort as far as Abbeville, whence he made his way to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, arriving on 3 March. Shortly afterwards, at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a>, he completed Sander's imperfect "Origin and Growth of the Anglican Schism". With the intention of taking his doctorate in divinity he proceeded to the University of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, but the plague broke out, and though he went to Saint-M&eacute;nehould to escape the infection, he died of it and was buried there. <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a> in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> ascribes his death to 1586, in which mistake he has been followed by the writer in the "Dictionary of National Biography" and others. After his death the book on the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was published by <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a>, and subsequent editions included two tracts attributed to Rishton, the one a diary of an anonymous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the Tower (1580-5), which was probably the work of Father John Hart, S.J.; the other a list of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with later additions by <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a>. Recent publication of the "Tower Bills" makes it certain that Rishton did not write the diary, and his only other known works are a tract on the difference between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> (Douai, 1575) and "Profession of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made manifest and confirmed by twenty-one reasons".
