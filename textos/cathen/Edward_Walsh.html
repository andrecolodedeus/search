<h1>Edward Walsh</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> poet, born at Derry <span class="stiki">actually Doire, near Kiskeam in County Cork</span> in 1805; died at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 6 August, 1850. When little more than a boy he showed great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and in 1830 was private tutor in County Cork. He was for a time teacher of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Millstreet, whence, in 1837, he removed to Tourin, County Waterford, having been appointed to a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the Commissioners of Education. Many of his songs and poems appeared between the years 1832-39, and he contributed to the "Nation". Worried with the surroundings of an uncongenial occupation, and pestered by officials, whose visits were ill-received by the super-sensitive poet, he went to reside in Dublin in 1843, and was befriended by <a href="../cathen/05187a.htm">Gavan Duffy</a>, who got him appointed sub-editor of the "Monitor". His "Irish Jacobite Poetry" (1844) and his "Irish Popular Songs" (1847) gave unmistakable evidence of a genuine poet. Yet he was forced to fight against poverty, and, in 1848, he accepted the post of schoolmaster to the junior convicts of Spike Island, where he was visited by John Mitchell, on his way to penal servitude, who vividly describes in his "Jail Journal" his meeting with Walsh. Not long afterwards, he secured the schoolmastership of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> work-house, but died within twelve months. A fine monument, with an epitaph in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and English, was erected to his memory in the Father Mathew Cemetery at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>. Among his lyrics "Mo Chragibhin Cno", "Brighidin ban mo stor", and "O'Donovan's Daughters" are in most <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> anthologies, while his translations from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> are both faithful and musical.
