<h1>Egbert, Archbishop of Trier</h1>  

<p>Died 8 or 9 December, 993. He belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Count Theodoric I and Countess Hildegarde, sent him to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the Abbey of Egmont, located within their dominions. Egbert is first mentioned in history as head of the imperial chancery, then under Archbishop Willigis of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Documents of 976 and 977 record him as holding this office. In 977 he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, which see was vacant by the death of Theodoric. Here he remained till 993. He sought particularly to remove from this great diocese all traces of the ravages caused by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> at the end of the ninth century, and to foster the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms that had been progressing since the days of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>. He completed the restoration, begun by his predecessor, of the Abbey of S. Maria ad Martyres near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Just outside the city he built the abbey-church of <a href="../cathen/05594a.htm">St. Eucharius</a> (St. Mathias), to which <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> contributed generously. On this occasion the body of St. Celsus was discovered. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> itself was richly endowed and its <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> flourished again. The collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Paulinus, near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, was similarly endowed, a regular income for its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> assured, and a fitting solemnity in Divine Worship made possible. Abbot Hetzel of Mettlach was deposed for conduct unworthy of his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and station. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was reformed, and its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> became an active centre of studious occupations. In M&uuml;nstermaifeld St. Martin's was raised to the dignity of a collegiate church and was correspondingly endowed. From all these regenerated centres, likewise from the Abbeys of Echternach and St. Maximin, that needed no reformation, a beneficent, spiritual, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> influence radiated in all directions through the diocese.

<p>Egbert was an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, and with Willigis of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> exerted a wholesome influence over the emperor, whom he accompanied on his journey to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 983. After Otto's death he stood at first for Henry the Wrangler (Znker), but soon went over to <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and his mother Theophano. Other evidence of the religious renaissance in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a> is found in the admirable works of ecclesiastical art inspired by Egbert and executed mostly in <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> itself. Among these are several valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>: the famous "Codex Egberti", a book of Gospels written at <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> and richly adorned with miniatures, now preserved in the city <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>; the "Psalterium Egberti", written in 981 and now in the chapter <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Cividale (<a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), to which it was donated by St. Elizabeth of Thuringia (also called the "Codex Gertrudianus", after the Russian Grand Duchess Gertrude, who became its possessor in 1085); the "Codex Epternacensis", which contains also the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> and is kept in the Gotha <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>; likewise several Sacramentaries, transcripts from the "Letter Book" (Registrum) of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (596-604), etc. The arts of the goldsmith and of the worker in enamel were particularly well cultivated at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Among valuable specimens still extant are: at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> a <a href="../cathen/01348b.htm">portable altar</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> the golden case or covering with richly adorned head of the so-called St. Peter's Staff, once a part of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, now in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church at <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>. Egbert was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Andrew, built by him near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>.
