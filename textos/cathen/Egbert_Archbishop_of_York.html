<h1>Egbert, Archbishop of York</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, son of Eata, brother of the Northumbrian King Eadbert and cousin of <a href="../cathen/03537a.htm">King Ceolwulf</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> dedicated his history; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 19 November, 766. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his brother Ecgred, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Ecgred died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Egbert immediately returned to Northumbria. On the resignation of the Bishopric of York by Wilfrid II in 732, <a href="../cathen/03537a.htm">King Ceolwulf</a> appointed Egbert his successor. Shortly after his accession <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> wrote a long letter to him advising him to give much time to study and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to ordain more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and to translate the Creed and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> into the Saxon tongue. He also urged him to strive to obtain the subdivision of many of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the North in order that episcopal visitations might be more frequently made. He called his attention to many disorders that were prevalent and particularly urged him to secure the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> for himself. Acting upon this advice Egbert obtained the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 735, and thus became the second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, that title having been lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of York ever since Paulinus had fled into Kent more than a century before. During all those years no one sought for the restoration of that lost dignity, and this neglect was afterwards used as a strong argument in favour of the precedence of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, when the well-known controversy arose between the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The restoration of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to Egbert increased his power and authority over the Northern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who thus became his suffragans; and his power was still more strengthened in 738 when his brother Eadbert succeeded to the throne of Northumbria. Egbert was thus placed in a position which enabled him to carry out many reforms, and in the performance of these he proved himself a strict disciplinarian; but though stern when correction and rebuke were justly deserved, he was remarkable for his sweetness and gentleness. His pupil <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> frequently speaks of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and energy and always refers to him in terms of the deepest affection. "He is said to have been the first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who possessed a mint at York. He paid great attention to the services and music of his church, introducing the observance of the Hours. He was also a benefactor to the fabric of the minster, bestowing upon his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the choice work of the jeweller and the goldsmith, and giving to it figured curtains of silk of foreign workmanship. He was, in all probability, the first introducer of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> system into the North" (Fasti Ebor.). One of his greatest works, perhaps, was the foundation of the famous School of York and its celebrated <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The renown of its masters and scholars soon spread through every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> country, and noble youths from all parts flocked to York to be taught by the great <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He himself taught divinity, whilst his assistant Albert, who afterwards succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, gave lessons in grammar and in the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. The fact that the illustrious <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> was Egbert's pupil, sheds no little lustre on this famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> daily work has been thus described by <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> himself: "As soon as he was at leisure in the morning, he sent for some young clerks, and sitting on his couch taught them successively till noon, at which time he retired to his private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. After dinner, at which he ate sparingly, he amused himself with hearing his pupils discuss literary questions in his presence. In the evening he recited with them the service of complin, and then calling them in order, he gave his blessing to each as they <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> in succession at his feet" (Mabillon, Acta SS. Ord. S. B., ad an. 815). Towards the end of his life he left the care of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to Albert and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, giving himself more time and opportunity to prepare for his end in peace and tranquillity. In this life of retirement and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he was joined by his brother King Eadbert, who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned his throne to enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 757. Egbert died before his brother, having ruled over the Diocese of York nearly thirty-four years. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in one of the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at York. His best-known work is the "De Jure Sacerdotali", a collection of canonical regulations. Extracts from it made in the eleventh century, under the title of "Excerptiones e dictis et canonibus SS. patrum" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XII, 411-32; Wilkins, I, 101-12), were long current as a work of Egbert. Among the writings attributed to him are a "Pontificale", or series of special offices for the use of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; a "Dialogus Ecclesiastic&aelig; Institutionis"; a "Confessionale", and a "P&oelig;nitentiale", both of which were written in the vernacular as well as in Latin. The "Pontificale", an important <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> text, has been published by the Surtees Society, and his other works may be found in the second volume of Thorpe's "Ancient Laws and Institutes of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>". In its present shape the "P&oelig;nitentiale Egberti" (P.L., LXXXIX, 411 sqq.) contains but little from the hand of Egbert, and is a ninth-century <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> compilation, put together mostly from Halitgar. Similarly, the "Dialogus Eccl. Institutionis" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XII, 482-88) is said not to be from Egbert in its present form (see YORK; PENITENTIAL BOOKS; <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">LIBER PONTIFICALIS</a>).
