<p>DIOCESE OF EICHST&Auml;TT (EYSTADIUM) [EYSTETTENSIS or AYSTETTENSIS]

<p>The Diocese of Eichst&auml;tt, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, lies north of the Danube, and is suffragan to Bamberg. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his nephew St. Willibald (born 700 of an Anglo-Saxon royal family) first as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and regional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (741), and then (745) circumscribed and organized the diocese. Willibald called to his aid his brother Wunibald, who, together with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, had been active on the German mission of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, and also his sister <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a>. He erected for them the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Heidenheim on the Hahnenkamm, where the saintly pair laboured most effectively and found their resting-place (Wunibald d. 761, Walburga d. 779). Willibald, well known for his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Christian Orient</a> and as a pilgrim to Palestine, founded in Eichst&auml;tt a flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> over which he presided as magister. He died in 781. The unbroken series of his successors down to the present time (1909) counts seventy-five names. Bishop Erchanbold (882-912) of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> line laid the foundation for the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Gradually this increased, especially through the inheritance of the Counts of Hirschberg (extinct in 1305), under Bishop Johann von Dirpheim (1305-1306), who was also chancellor of Emperor Albrecht I. Like other German princes, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Eichst&auml;tt acquired sovereignty (under Bishop Hartwig in 1220), and after various struggles became, from the fourteenth century, independent rulers over a territory which at one time comprised 437 square miles with 56,000 subjects. In the "secularization" of 1803 these domains were made over to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

<p>There were many illustrious incumbents of the See of Eichst&auml;tt. Bishop Reginold (965-989) was admired as a poet, musician, scholar, and orator. Bishop Heribert (1022-1042) was a patron of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Gundekar II (1057-1075) rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, composed the "Pontificale", in which the lives of his predecessors, the "Vitae Pontificum Eystettensium", and many other subjects, especially <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, are treated. This work, still preserved in the original (Codex M), is of great value for the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Gundekar is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. His predecessor was Gebhard I (1042-1057), the chancellor and friend of Henry III. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, did not rest until this emperor allowed the reluctant Gebhard to assume the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity. He was the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> whom in a long time the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had chosen freely. As Victor II (1055-1057) he was friendly to reforms, an extremely energetic man, and saintly in his life. Had he lived longer he would have taken rank among the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>; he died in 1057 at the age of thirty-nine. Bishops Eberhard I (1099-1112), Ulrich II (1112-1125), Gebhard 11 (1125-1149), and Otto (1182-1195) vigorously inaugurated reforms that were perfected and confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of 1186. A similar activity was displayed by Bishops Henry IV (1246-1259), Reunboto (1279-1297), and Philipp von Rathsamshausen (1306-1322). The last-named was a prolific writer, patron of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> tried to raise <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people to a higher level. Berthold (1354-1365), a Hohenzoller by birth, built the Willibaldsburg, provided for the material welfare of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and protected them against the attacks of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, nobility, and princes (Constitutio Bertholdiana). On all sides we meet with evidence of his regulating and stimulating <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> (Synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 1354).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> left its traces on the diocese. Bishop Johann III von Eich (1446-1464), a saintly man, did all in his power to efface them. He reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, organized the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, issued pastoral directions, protected vigorously the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, and attracted to Eichst&auml;tt a number of scholars (among them the Humanist Albert of Eyb). Having been, before his election, chancellor of the emperor and his representative at the Council of Basle, he continued as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to serve the State on diplomatic missions of great importance. Thus, he represented the emperor in the congress of princes which <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> called at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. His friend and successor, Wilhelm von Reichenau (1464-1496), the tutor of Maximilian I, was a Statesman, diplomat, and patron of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, but also a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who walked in the footsteps of his predecessor and left after him the memory of a brilliant administration. In 1480 he made a visitation of the whole diocese. The original records of this visitation, the oldest thus far known, are still extant, and give us an interesting picture of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, in which, however, there are not lacking deep shadows. His successors, the cultured Gabriel von Eyb (1496-1535) and the noble Moritz von Hutten (1539-1552), were men who fully understood the critical situation and set themselves against the perilous innovations of their time, but they could not prevent the imperial, cities of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and Weissenburg, the margraves of Ansbach and the palgraves of the Rhine, from annexing a large part of the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in order to restore their finances by means of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, and from forcing the people to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. Bishop Moritz gathered about him men of ability (Vitus von Ammerbach, Cochl&aelig;us), and convoked (1548) a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod whose records exhibit the spreading spiritual desolation.



<p>Bishop Martin von Schaumberg (1560-1590) founded the first <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1564) one year after the close of the Council, and secured for it excellent teachers (Robert Turner, Peter Stewart, Frederick Staphylus). Bishop Konrad von Gemmingen (1593-1612) rebuilt the Willibaldsburg, founded the "Hortus Eystettensis", a garden well known to all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> botanists, ordered frequent visitations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and embellished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with precious jewels. Bishop Christoph Johann von Westerstetten (1612-1636) invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Eichst&auml;tt built a magnificent (<a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>) church for them, and committed the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to their care. In 1634 the Swedes reduced almost the whole episcopal city to ashes, but it soon rose to new splendour under the long and prosperous reign of Bishop Marquard II (1636-1685), a scion of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Schenk von Castell. He reorganized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, won part of its territory (in the Upper Palatinate) back to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and was for years imperial plenipotentiary at the diets and eminent as a diplomat.

<p>The eighteenth century brought peace and prosperity, and many a magnificent structure in city and diocese rose under the gifted prince-bishops of those days (residence and garden, the fountains called Marienbrunnen and Willibaldsbrunnen, castle of Hirschberg, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Notre-Dame). Bishop Raymund Anton, Count of Strassoldo (1757-1781), prepared for his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the well-known "Instructio Pastoralis", a book of pastoral direction, which in its latest (fifth) edition (Freiburg im Breisgau; 1902) is even yet much admired. The "secularization" (1803) robbed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eichst&auml;tt of his ancient <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, but the diocese remained and was reorganized by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of circumscription of 1821. <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Cardinal Karl August von Reisach</a> (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eichst&auml;tt, 1835-1846) renewed its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, opened the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys (1838) and the lyceum (1844), with a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, and in union with Joseph Ernst (d. 1869), president (<em>Regens</em>) of the latter institution, breathed into it the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a spirit which since then has never failed. Bishop Georg von Oettl (1847-1866) and his Successor, Franz Leopold von Leonrod (1867-1905), faithfully continued and completed the work begun by <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Reisach</a>. The conditions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are as well regulated as is possible; its people are solidly grounded in the Faith, while the learning, life, and labours of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are considered exemplary throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is rich in monuments of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">ecclesiastical architecture</a> and art: The Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> exhibits many excellent works of art from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century; especially noteworthy is its <em>mortuarium</em>. The <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Our Lady in Irigolstadt and the conventual churches of Kaste (Romanesque) and Freystadt (<a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>): are important monuments. Among <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> artists may be mentioned: Hans Paur (fifteenth century), Hans Pildschnitzer (fifteenth century), Loy Hering (sixteenth century), Gabriel de Gabrielis (seventeenth-eighteenth century), Ignaz Breitenauer (eighteenth century). In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Eichst&auml;tt possessed a flourishing <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time of St. Wulibald. Mostly with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> funds and through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Wilhelm von Reichenau, the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> was founded in 1472. Many of its professors became famous. Among its <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a>, P. Canisius, <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a>, Salmeron, <a href="../cathen/07029b.htm">Jacob Gretser</a>; among its canonists: <a href="../cathen/12724c.htm">Reiffenstuel</a>, <a href="../cathen/12108a.htm">Pirhing</a>, <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Schmalzgrueber</a>; among its jurists, Wiguleus Kreittmayr, Ad. Ickstatt; among its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, scientists, and mathematicians: Johann Reuchlin, Conrad Celtes, Christoph Scheiner, Caspar Scioppius, Philipp and Petrus Apian, Fuchs Leonhard, and others. Early in the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was transferred to Landshut, thence to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>.

<p>The most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in olden times was the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded by St. Willibald in 740 and out of which grew the diocese. At the end of the tenth century it became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter with secular canons. Heidenheim was at, first a <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double monastery</a>, founded by St. Willibald; it was changed (800) to a chapter of canons; later it became again a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Before the change the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> moved to Herrieden and erected there, under Abbot Dietker and through the benevolence of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which was changed to a chapter of canons in 888 and secularized in 1804. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> moved from Heidenheim to Monheim, taking with them some of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a>, which were lost in the "secularization" of the sixteenth century. St. Walburg (Benedictine <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>) in Eichst&auml;tt (founded 870) was endowed in 1035 by Count Leodegar and reorganized by Bishop Heribert. It is yet flourishing despite its temporary secularization (1802-1835), and possesses some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a>. Kastel in the Upper Palatinate, founded 1098 (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> congregation), took a prominent part in the reforms of the twelfth century; it was secularized in 1556, and in 1636, during the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, its domains were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Amberg, and after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> (1773) to the Knights of Malta; in 1806 it was secularized once more. Plankstetten (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, founded 1129) was also secularized in 1802. Heilsbronn (Cistercians, founded 1132), also <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms, was secularized in 1530 by the margraves of Ansbach. Rebdorf (Augustinian canons, founded 1159 through the powerful help of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>) was the home of Prior Kilian Leib (1471-1552), linguist and historian; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was secularized in 1802. Bergen (Benedictine <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, founded 976) was suppressed in 1552 by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes of Neuburg; its estates passed later into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who used them to found the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and gymnasium in Neuburg on the Danube (1664). The "Schottenkloster zum heiligen Kreuz" (The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Monastery of the Holy Cross), an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundation of 1140 in Eichst&auml;tt, passed over to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in 1623, lived through the "secularization" of the early nineteenth century, and is still flourishing. In the thirteenth century arose the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Engelthal (suppressed in 1550 by the people of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>); Seligenporten (Cistercian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>), secularized in 1556, after the re-Catholicizing of the Upper Palatinate given to the Salesian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Amberg and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and again secularized in 1802; Gnadenthal in Ingolstadt (Franciscan <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, founded in 1276), still flourishing. In the fifteenth century were founded: Gnadenberg (Brigittines), Mariastein near Rebdorf (Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>), K&ouml;nigshofen, Marienburg near Abenberg, all of which disappeared during the last secularization (1802-1806). Eichst&auml;tt had still other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>: thus the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> had a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the city (founded 1279, secularized in 1802); the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in Weissenburg, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in Ingolstadt (1275). From the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had flourishing colleges in Eichst&atilde;tt and Ingolstadt, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in Eichst&auml;tt and Wemding (1669). The <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> had a flourishing commandery in Ellingen which was secularized in 1802.

<p>At present (1909) the diocese numbers one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> (Plankstetten), four of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (Ingolstadt, Dietfurt, Berching, Freystadt), two of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> (Eichst&auml;tt, Wemding), two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (St. Walburg and Gnadenthal), and about forty-six houses of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> congregations, among them the flourishing institute of the English Ladies in Eichst&atilde;tt. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, restored by <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Reisach</a>, was enlarged in 1844 by the addition of a philosophico-theological academy (lyceum), and under eminent scholars has attained a high degree of prosperity and scientific fame. (Professors: Johann Pruner, d. 1907; G. Suttner, d. 1888; Franz Morgott, d. 1900; Valent. <a href="../cathen/14554a.htm">Thalhofer</a>, d. 1891; Alb. St&ouml;ckl, d. 1895; Math.
