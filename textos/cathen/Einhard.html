<h1>Einhard</h1>  

<p>(Less correctly EGINHARD), historian, born c. 770 in the district watered by the River Main in the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire; d. 14 March, 840, at Seligenstadt. His earliest training he received at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, where he showed such unusual <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> powers that Abbot Baugulf sent him to the court of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was completed at the Palace School, where he was fortunate enough to count among his masters the great <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, who bears witness to his remarkable talent in mathematics and architecture, and also to the fact that, in spite of his unattractive <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, he was among the emperor's most trusted advisers. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> gave Einhard charge of his great public buildings, e.g. the construction of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the palaces of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> and Ingelheim, for which reason he was known in court circles as Beseleel, after the <a href="../cathen/02526d.htm">builder of the tabernacle</a> (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm">Exodus 21</a>). <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> also availed himself of Einhard's tact and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to send him on various diplomatic missions. Thus, in 802 he placed in his hands the negotiations for the exchange of distinguished Saxon hostages, and in 806 he was dispatched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> for the partition of the empire the emperor had just decided upon.

<p>During the reign of Louis the Pious he retained his position of trust, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a faithful counsellor to Louis's son Lothair. Unsuccessful, however, in his attempts to settle the contests for the crown which had been stirred up by Empress Judith, and unable to bring about a lasting reconciliation between Louis and his sons, Einhard, in 830, withdrew to M&uuml;hlheim (Mulinheim) on the Main, which he had been granted as early as 815, together with other estates, as a mark of imperial favour. He transferred thither the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Marcellinus and Peter, and called the place Seligenstadt. Moreover, between 831 and 834 he established here a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, where, after the death of his wife, Emma (or Imma), sister of Bishop Bernhar of Worms (not daughter of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>), he spent the rest of his life as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. It is not certain whether he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. His epitaph was written by <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>.

<p>The most important of Einhard's works is the "Vita Caroli Magni." This, the best biography of the whole period of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, written in close imitation of Suetonius, particularly his "Vita Augusti", shows the emperor from the standpoint of the most intimate personal acquaintance with all sides of his character, and with a genuine attempt at <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of portrayal. The diction is in general elegant, though not polished. The annals of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Empire, which have been handed down as Einhard's (ed. Kurze, 1895), are, in their present form, older materials worked over. Those for the years between 796 and 820 may date back to Einhard. In addition, we have from is hand the "Translatio et Miracula SS. Marcellini et Petri", containing data which are important for the history of culture. The seventy-one letters, written by Einhard between 825 and 830 in a clear, simple style, constitute an important source for the history of Louis the Pious.
