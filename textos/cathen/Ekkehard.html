<h1>Ekkehard</h1>  

<p>Name of five <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the (Swiss) Abbey of St. Gall from the tenth to the thirteenth century.

<p>(1) EKKEHARD I (MAJOR, "the Elder"), d. 14 Jan., 973. He was of noble birth, of the Jonschwyl <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Toggenburg, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gall; after joining the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, he was appointed director of the inner <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there. Later, under Abbot Kralo, who trusted him implicitly, he was elected dean of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and for a while directed all the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Ekkehard made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was retained for a time by <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">Pope John XII</a>, who presented him with various <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. After Kralo's death Ekkehard refused the abbatial succession, because of lameness resulting from a fractured leg. However, he directed the choice of Burkard, son of Count Ulrich of Buchhorn, who governed St. Gall with the advice and co-operation of Ekkehard. The latter erected a hospice in front of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the sick and strangers, and was in many other ways a model of charity. He was also distinguished as a poet, and wrote a Latin epic "Waltharius", basing his version on an original German text. He dedicated this poem to Bishop Erkanbald of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (965-991). It describes the elopement of Walter of Aquitaine with the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> princess Hildegunde, from the land of the Huns, followed by the battle of Wasgenstein between Walter and the followers of Gunther and Hagen (ed. Peiper, Berlin, 1873). He also composed various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and sequences, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, St. Benedict, St. Columbanus, St. Stephen (Meyer, "Philologische Bemerkungen zum Waltharius" in "Abhandl. der bayr. Akad. d. Wissenschaften", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1873; Streeker, "Ekkehard und Virgil" in "Zeitschrift f. deutsches Altertum", 1898, XLII, 338-366).

<p>(2) EKKEHARD II (PALATINUS, "the Courtier"), d. 23 April, 990. He and Ekkehard III were nephews of the preceding, who <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> also at St. Gall his other nephews, <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker the physician</a> and Burkard, later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Ekkehard II was taught by his uncle and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Geraldus, and was later a teacher in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. A number of his pupils joined the order; others became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. According to the "Casus Sancti Galli" he was called later to Hohentwiel, the seat of the Duchess Hadwig of Swabia, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Burkard II. The duchess was wont occasionally to visit St. Gall, and eventually (973) asked for and obtained the services of Ekkehard as her tutor in the reading of the Latin classics. Nevertheless, he continued to render great services to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, especially on the occasion of the differences between St. Gall and <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> (Abbot Ruodmann); in many other ways also he proved himself useful to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by the influence he had obtained as tutor of the duchess. Ekkehard was also prominent at the imperial court of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>. Later he became <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where he died 23 April, 990. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a>, outside the city gates. He was the author of various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, known as sequences, all of which are lost, except one in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Desiderius.

<p>(3) EKKEHARD III, also a nephew of Ekkehard I and a cousin of the preceding. He shared the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> advantages of his cousin and, at his invitation, accompanied him to Hohentwiel to superintend and direct the studies of the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On his return to St. Gall he was made dean of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and is reported to have filled this office for thirty years. He died early in the eleventh century.

<p>(4) EKKEHARD IV. According to the testimony in his "Chronicle" (especially in view of his statement that he had heard from eyewitnesses of the great conflagration at St. Gall in 937), the date of his birth is usually placed about 980; he died 21 Oct., but the year of his death is unknown (1036?-1060?). The same "Chronicle" indicates Alsace as his birthplace, though we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> either the place of his birth, or his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> origin. His boyhood was spent at St. Gall where he had for tutor <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker Labeo</a> the German, one of the most learned scholars of his time. From him Ekkehard acquired a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Latin and Greek classics; he also studied mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and music, and was acknowledged while living as a scholar of note even outside the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker Labeo</a> (1022) Ekkehard was called to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> by Archbishop Aribo, where he became director and teacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and held both offices until the death of his patron (1031), distinguishing himself as head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; indeed, he was noted as a successful teacher and promoter of learning. A treatise on the "Jube me, Domine, benedicere", inscriptions, and benediction <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> remain as evidences of his literary activity. Emperor Conrad II, when at Ingelheim near <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, distinguished him by marks of personal favour (<a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1030). Shortly after his return to St. Gall Abbot Tietbald died (1034) and Norbert of Stavelot, who introduced the reforms of Cluny, was elected to succeed him. A dissension, therefore, arose among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the seniors being dissatisfied with the new reforms. Ekkehard, meanwhile, began work on the ancient <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> chronicle, the famous "Casus S. Galli", begun by Ratpert and continued to Abbot Salomon (883), and carried it on from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a> (972). This work is a most important document for the contemporary history of St. Gall (ed. von Arx in "Mon. Germ. Historica: Scriptores" II, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, 1829; ed. Meyer* von Knonau in "St. Gallische Geschichtsquellen" in "Mitteil. zur vaterl&auml;nd. Geschichte" (new series, nn. 5 and 6, St. Gall, 1877); it is also the main source of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning the Ekkehards. The "Casus" is mostly a compilation of anecdotes and traditions concerning distinguished <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. They contain, however, many historical <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and misrepresentations, and the Latin diction is often barbarous. Nevertheless, owing to the excellence and simplicity of the narrative, they are a valuable source of contemporary history, especially of its culture. The second important literary work of Ekkehard is his "Liber Benedictionum". It comprises metrical inscriptions for the walls of the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and benedictions (also in verse) for use in choir-service and at meals, also poems in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the festivals of various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, partly from his own pen and partly by <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker Labeo</a>. In poetical merit these works are inferior enough, nevertheless they betray a very fair <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Latin. The glosses from his pen, both on his own <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and others belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, remain as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his lifelong <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He was also skilled in music, especially <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">ecclesiastical music</a>, always diligently and successfully cultivated at St. Gall.

<p>(5) EKKEHARD V (MINIMUS), d. about 1220. He is the last of the St. Gall Ekkehards, and flourished towards the end of the twelfth, and the beginning of the thirteenth, century. No particulars are known concerning his life, and tradition is silent as to his origin, the year of his birth and of his death. He was dean of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. About 1214 he wrote a life of <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">St. Notker Balbulus</a>, a learned <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Gall, who lived towards the end of the ninth, and the beginning of the tenth, century (Acta SS., April, I, 579), from which work we gather that its author was versed in <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">ecclesiastical music</a>.
