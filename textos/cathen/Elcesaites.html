<h1>Elcesaites</h1>  

<p>(Or H<font size=-2>ELKESAITES</font>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Gnostic Ebionites</a>, whose religion was a wild medley of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrines</a> with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (Philosophumena, IX, 13-17) tells us that under Callistus (217-222) a cunning individual called Alcibiades, a native of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, bringing a book which he said had been received from Parthia by a just man named Elchasai (<em>&rsquo;Elchasa&#237;</em>; but Epiphanius has <em>&rsquo;Elksa&#237;</em> and <em>&rsquo;Elkessa&#238;oi</em>; Methodius, <em>&rsquo;Elkesa&#238;os</em>, and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <em>&rsquo;Elkesa&#239;ta&#237;</em>). The contents of the book had been revealed by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ninety-six miles high, sixteen miles broad, and twenty-four across the shoulders, whose footprints were fourteen miles long and four miles wide by two miles deep. This was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and He was accompanied by His Sister, the Holy Ghost, of the same dimensions. Alcibiades announced that a new remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> had been proclaimed in the third year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 100), and he described a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which should impart this forgiveness even to the grossest sinners. Harnack makes him say "was proclaimed" instead of "has been proclaimed" (as if <em>e&uacute;aggelisth&#234;nai</em> and not <em>e&uacute;eggel&#237;sthai</em>), and thus infers that a special year of remission is spoken of as past once for all&mdash;that Alcibiades had no reason for inventing this, so that Hilgenfeld was right in holding that Elchasai really lived under <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, as Epiphanius supposed. If we put aside this blunder of Harnack's (and also his earlier odd conjecture that the remission in the third year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> meant that the first two books of the Pastor of Hermas were published in that year), we see that the remission offered is by the new <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> represents this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as an improvement invented by Alcibiades on the lax teaching of his enemy Callistus. He does not perhaps expect us to take this seriously&mdash;it is most likely ironical&mdash;but he seems to regard Alcibiades as the author of the book. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, writing somewhat later (c. 246-9), says the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was quite new; he seems to have met with Alcibiades, though he does not give his name. There is no reason why we should dissent from these contemporary witnesses, and we must place the first appearance of the book of Elchasai c. 220. A century and a half later, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> found it in use among the Samps&aelig;ans, descendants of the earlier Elcesaites, and also among the Oss&aelig;ns, and many of the other <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionite</a> communities. En-hedim, an Arabic writer, c. 987, found a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Sab&aelig;ans in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> who counted El-Chasaiach as their founder (Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier, 1856, I, 112; II, 543, cited by Salmon).

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> the teaching of Alcibiades was borrowed from various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. He taught <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a man like others, that he had many times been born on earth of a virgin, that he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, magic, and incantations. For all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of impurity, even against nature, a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is enjoined "in the name of the great and most high God and in the name of His Son the great King", with an adjuration of the seven witnesses written in the book, sky, water, the holy spirits, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, oil, salt, and earth. One who has been bitten by a mad dog is to run to the nearest water and jump in with all his clothes on, using the foregoing formula, and promising the seven witnesses that he will abstain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The same treatment&mdash;forty days consecutively of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in cold water&mdash;is recommended for consumption and for the possessed. Other <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a> in Epiphanius's time practised this treatment. That saint tells us that mention was made in the book of Elchasai's brother, Iexai, and that the heresiarch was a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of the time of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>. Two of his descendants, two sisters, Marthus and Marthana, lived till the days of Epiphanius. They were reverenced as goddesses and the dust of their feet and their spittle were used to cure diseases. This suggests that Elchasai was not a fictitious personage. He was presumably a primitive leader of an <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionite</a> community, to whom Alcibiades ascribed his own book. We learn further from Epiphanius that the book condemned virginity and continence, and made marriage <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. It permitted the worship of idols to escape <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, provided the act was merely an external one, disavowed in the heart. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> was to be made not to the East, but always towards <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Yet all sacrifice was condemned, with a denial that it had been offered by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> or under the Law. The Prophets as well as the Apostles were rejected, and of course <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and all his writings. It has been customary to find Elcasaite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the Clementine "Homilies" and "Recognitions", especially in the former. On the groundlessness of this see C<font size=-2>LEMENTINES</font>.
