<h1>Elect</h1>  

<p>Denotes in general one chosen or taken by preference from among two or more; as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> term it is equivalent to "chosen as the object of mercy or Divine favour, as set apart for eternal life". In order to determine the meaning of the word more accurately, we shall have to study its usage both in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the New.
<h2 id="section1">The Old Testament</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> applies the term <em>elect</em>, or <em>chosen</em>, only to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in as far as they are called to be the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or are faithful to their Divine call. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of such an election is common in the Book of Deuteronomy and in <a href="../bible/isa040.htm">Isaiah 40</a>-<a href="../bible/isa066.htm">66</a>. In <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#vrs6">Psalm 104:6 and 43</a> and <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#vrs5">105:5</a>, the chosen ones are the Hebrew people in as far as it is the recipient of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> temporal and spiritual <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>; in <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 65:9, 15 and 23</a>, they are the repentant <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, as few in number "as if a grain can be found in a cluster" (ibid., 8); in Tob., xiii, 10, they are the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> remaining faithful during their captivity; in Wisd., iii, 9, and iv, 15, they are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servants; in <a href="../bible/sir024.htm#vrs4">Sirach 24:4, 13</a> and <a href="../bible/sir046.htm#vrs2">46:2</a>, these servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> belong to the chosen people.
<h2 id="section2">The New Testament</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> transfers (excepting perhaps in <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs17">Acts 13:17</a>) the meaning of the term from its connection with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people of Israel</a> to the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, either militant on earth or triumphant in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Thus <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs1">1 Peter 1:1</a>, speaks of the elect among the "strangers dispersed" through the various parts of the world; <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs9">1 Peter 2:9</a>, represents them as "a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people", called from darkness into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> marvellous light. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, too, speaks of the elect (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs33">Romans 8:33</a>) and describes the five degrees of their election: they are foreknown, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>, called, justified, and glorified (loc. cit., 29, 30). He returns to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> gain and again: <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs12">2 Thessalonians 2:12 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs12">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs1">Titus 1:1-2</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#vrs10">2 Timothy 2:10</a>. St. John gives the title of elect to those who fight on the side of the Lamb against the powers of darkness (<a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs14">Revelation 17:14</a>). According to <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs7">Luke 18:7</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears the cries of his elect for vengeance; according to the first two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> he will shorten the last days for the sake of the elect (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs22">Matthew 24:22, 24, 31</a>; <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs20">Mark 13:20, 22, 27</a>).

<p>If it be asked why the name <em>elect</em> was given to the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant, we may assign a double reason: first, they were freely chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs5">Romans 11:5-7, 28</a>); secondly, they must show in their conduct that they are choice men (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs17">Ephesians 4:17</a>). In the sentence "many are called, but few are chosen", the latter expression renders a word in the Greek and Latin text which is elsewhere translated by <em>elect</em> (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs16">Matthew 20:16</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs14">22:14</a>). It is agreed on all sides that the term refers to members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Triumphant, but there is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether it refers to mere membership, or to a more exalted degree. This distinction is important; if the word implies mere membership in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Triumphant, then the chosen ones, or those who will be saved, are few, and the non-members in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Triumphant are many; if the word denotes a special degree of glory, then few will attain this rank, and many will fail to do so, though many are called to it. The sentence "many are called, but few chosen" does not, therefore, settle the question as to the relative number of the elect and the lost; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are divided on this point, and while Christ in the Gospels urges the importance of saving one's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs23">Luke 13:23, 24</a>), he alternately so strengthens our hope and excites our fear as not to leave us any solid ground for either presumption or despair.
