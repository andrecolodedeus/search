<h1>Elias of Jerusalem</h1>  

<p>Died 518; one of the two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (with Flavian of Antioch) who resisted the attempt of the Emperor Anastasius I (491-518) to abolish the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451). Anastasius spent the greater part of his reign in a vain attempt to impose <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> on his subjects. Unlike his predecessors, who favoured <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> merely as a political expedient whereby to conciliate <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the great number of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Anastasius carried on his propaganda apparently from religious conviction. His chief adviser, Marinus, a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, was also a convinced <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>. At first the emperor tried to arrange a compromise. The population of Constantinople and nearly all the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> provinces were too Chalcedonian for an open attack on that council to be safe. Macedonius II, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (469-511), submitted so far as to sign Zeno's Henotikon (482), but refused to condemn the council. Flavian of Antioch also for a time approved of a policy of compromise. The <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (484-519) still continued during the reign of Anastasius, but the emperor and his patriarch made advances to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>&mdash;advances that came to nothing, since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> always insisted on the removal of the names of former schismatics from the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. Gradually Anastasius went over completely to the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. Severus of <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, Xenaias of Tahal in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and a great crowd of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> overwhelmed him with petitions to have the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of his convictions and to break openly with the Dyophysites. In the emperor's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> the Trisagion was sung with the famous <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> addition ("who was crucified for us"). Macedonius of Constantinople was deposed (511), and an open <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, Timothy I (511-518), took his place. Timothy began a fierce <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Then the Government summoned a synod at <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> in 512 that was to condemn the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. It was chiefly Elias of Jerusalem who prevented this result.

<p>Elias was an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a>, by birth, who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In 457 he was driven out by the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, Timothy the Cat. He then came to Palestine and founded a laura at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. Anastasius of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 494 Elias succeeded Sallustius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until 513. He acknowledged <a href="../cathen/05606a.htm">Euphemius of Constantinople</a> (see E<font size=-2>UPHEMIUS</font>) and refused the communion of Macedonius, the intruder. About 509 the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Xenaias of Hierapolis tried to make Elias sign a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> formula, and the emperor ordered him to summon a synod that should condemn the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. Instead, Elias sent the emperor a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> profession that his enemies seem to have falsified on the way. <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a> says: "He when he had written it sent it to the Emperor by the hands of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus'</a> followers" (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>). "And the profession that they then showed contained an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against those who speak of two natures in Christ. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, saying that it had been tampered with, sent another without that <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. Nor is this surprising. For they often corrupted works of the holy Fathers" (H. E., III, xxxi). The Synod of <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> in 512 was to condemn Chalcedon and depose Elias and Flavian. But they succeeded in persuading the Fathers to do neither (Labbe, Council., IV, 1414). The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> went on accusing these two of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and Anastasius deposed them, in spite of the protest of Elias' <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Sabas. Flavian was deposed first and Severus, an open <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, was introduced in his place. With this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> Elias and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Palestine would have no communion (Evagr., H. E., III, xxxiii). Then the Count of Palestine, <a href="../cathen/11249a.htm">Olympus</a>, arrived at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and offered Elias his choice of signing a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> formula or being deposed. Elias refused to sign and was banished to Aila on the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> (513). His <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> remained faithful to him to the end.

<p>Elias of Jerusalem was the founder of many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The common presentation of him as a compromiser is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. He was steadfastly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> throughout and protested at once against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> formula brought to the emperor in his name. The Syrian Uniat Church keeps his feast, with <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a> of Antioch, on 18 Feb. (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, Kalend. Man., I, 471). These two are named in the Roman Martyrology on 4 July
