<h1>Eliza Allen Starr</h1>  

<p>Born at Deerfield, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 29 August, 1824; died at Durand, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, 8 September, 1901.

<p>She was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at her father's home. On her father's side she was descended from Dr. Comfort Starr of Ashford, County Kent, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who settled at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, in 1633, and, on her mother's side, from the "Allans of the Bars", who came from Chelmsford Essex, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. She inherited the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of literature from her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and when thirteen years of age went to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, where she finished her studies in 1845. In <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> she opened a studio, but, the climate proving unfavorable to her health, she moved to <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, thence to Philadelphia. She finally accepted a position as teacher in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of a wealthy planter at <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, Mississippi. In 1853 she returned to Brooklyn as teacher of drawing in a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In 1848 she returned to Philadelphia. It was during this visit to her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> she met the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Rt. Rev. Francis Patrick Kenrick</a>, who later became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. It was from this saintly and learned churchman that the germs of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> already in her heart received their first activities. After an incessant struggle of nine years she was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> by Bishop Fitzpatrick on 23 December, 1854, and made her first Communion on the following <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> morning in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Sisters of Charity. In 1856 Miss Starr entered upon a larger field of labor. In <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> she found her life work. She labored with her pen, and with the pencil illustrated her books. She lectured throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and in the auditorium of her home annually gave a course of ten lectures upon art and literature.

<p>Her published works include: <ul><li>"Songs of a Lifetime"; <li>"Patron Saints"; <li>"Pilgrims and Shrines"; <li>"Isabella of Castile"; <li>"What we see"; <li>"Ode to Christopher Columbus"; <li>"Christmas-tide"; <li>"Christian art in our own age"; <li>"The Seven Dolours of the Virgin Mary"; <li>"Literature of Christian Art"; <li>"The Three Keys to the Camera della Segnatura in the Vatican"; <li>"Art in the Chicago Churches", published in the "New World"; <li>"Woman's Work in Art"; and <li>"The Three Archangels and the Guardian Angels in Art."</ul> In recognition of this last work <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> sent to her a beautiful medallion. She was the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to receive the Laetare Medal, which was conferred on her in 1865 by the <a href="../cathen/11132a.htm">University of Notre Dame</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>.
