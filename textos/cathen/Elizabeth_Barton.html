<h1>Elizabeth Barton</h1>  

<p>Born probably in 1506; executed at Tyburn, 20 April, 1534; called the "Nun of Kent." The career of this <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visionary</a>, whose prophecies led to her execution under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, has been the source of a historical controversy which resolves itself into the question: Was she gifted with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or was she an impostor?

<p>In 1525, when nineteen years of age, being then employed as a domestic servant at Aldington, Kent, she had an illness during which she fell into frequent trances and told "wondrously things done in other places whilst she was neither herself present nor yet heard no report thereof." From the first her utterances assumed a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> and were "of marvellous <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in rebuke of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and vice."

<p>Her <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Richard Masters, convinced of her sincerity, reported the matter to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, who sent a commission of three Canterbury <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/02608b.htm">Bocking</a>, Hadleigh, and Barnes, two <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Hugh Rich and <a href="../cathen/13063a.htm">Richard Risby</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> official, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to examine her again. Shortly after the commission pronounced in her favour, her prediction that the Blessed Virgin would cure her at a certain <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was fulfilled, when in presence of a large crowd she was restored to health. She then became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, living near <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, with a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Her fame gradually spread until she came into wide public notice.

<p>She protested "in the name and by the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" against the king's projected <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. To further her opposition, besides writing to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, she had interviews with <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Fisher</a>, <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">king</a> himself. Owing to her reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, she <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> one of the most formidable opponents of the royal <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, so that in 1533 Cromwell took steps against her and, after examination by Cranmer, she was in November, with <a href="../cathen/02608b.htm">Dr. Bocking</a>, her confessor, and others, committed to the Tower. Subsequently, all the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were made to do public penance at St. Paul's and at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and to publish confessions of deception and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>.

<p>In January, 1534, a <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">bill of attainder</a> was framed against her and thirteen of her sympathizers, among whom were <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Fisher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a>. Except the latter, whose name was withdrawn, all were condemned under this bill; seven, including <a href="../cathen/02608b.htm">Bocking</a>, Masters, Rich, <a href="../cathen/13063a.htm">Risby</a>, and Elizabeth herself, being sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, while <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Fisher</a> and five others were condemned to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and forfeiture of goods. Elizabeth and her companions were executed at Tyburn on 20 April, 1534, when she is said to have repeated her confession.

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> authors allege that these confessions alone are conclusive of her imposture, but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, though they have felt free to hold divergent opinions about the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, have pointed out the suggestive fact that all that is known as to these confessions emanates from Cromwell or his agents; that all available documents are on his side; that the confession issued as hers is on the face of it not her own composition; that she and her companions were never brought to trial, but were condemned and executed unheard; that there is contemporary evidence that the alleged confession was even then believed to be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. For these reasons, the matter cannot be considered as settled, and unfortunately, the difficulty of arriving at any satisfactory and final decision now seems insuperable.
