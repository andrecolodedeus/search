<h1>Ellwangen Abbey</h1>  

<p>The earliest <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> established in the <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">Duchy of Wurtemberg</a>, situated in the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a> about thirty miles north-east of the town of Stuttgart. Hariolfus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, was the founder, and the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of foundation was about 764, though there are a few authorities for as early a date as 732. In later times it became a royal <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> which seems to have been conferred in 1011 by the Emperor Henry II, and afterwards confirmed by the Emperor Charles IV, in 1347. Some authorities date the granting of this privilege as late as 1555. This cannot be correct, for it is known that the superior of Ellwangen took his seat in the Diet among the princes of the country in 1500. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> occupation of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> came to an end in the first half of the fifteenth century. In 1460 it was changed into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of secular canons under the rule of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>. Ellwangen had many men of renown connected with it: the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbots</a> Lindolf and Erfinan, whom <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> speaks of as famous authors; Abbot Gebhard began to write the life of St. Udalricus but died before completing it; Abbot Ermenrich (c. 845), author of the life of St. Solus which may be found in the fourth volume of the "Acta Sanctorum" of <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>. Adalbero, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 894. Abbot Lindebert became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, as also did Abbot Hatton (891). St. Gebhard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ellwangen, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 995. Abbot Milo about the middle of the tenth century was one of the visitors appointed for the visitation of the famous Abbey of St. Gall. Nothing is known of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> connected with Ellwangen during the period of its <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> history, but in the eighteenth century, after it had passed into the hands of the secular canons, its possessions included the court manor of Ellwangen, the manors of Taxstell, Neuler, Rothlein, Tannenburg, Wasseralfingen, Abts-Gmundt, Kockenburg near the town of Aalen, Henchlingen on the River Lein, and Lautern. Most of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings still exist, though they are no longer used for religious purposes. Since the <a href="../cathen/10453a.htm">secularization</a> they have been held by the State and used for state purposes.
