<h1>Elphin</h1>  

<p>D<font size=-2>IOCESE OF</font> E<font size=-2>LPHIN</font> (E<font size=-2>LPHINIUM</font>)

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, a see founded by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. All the known facts respecting its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are recorded in two important memorials of early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>, the "Vita Tripartita" of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, and the so-called "Patrician Documents" in the "Book of Armagh" (q.v.). On his missionary tour through Connaught, which he entered by crossing the Shannon at Drum-boilan, near Battlebridge, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Ardcarne, in 434 or 435, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> came to the territory of Corcoghlan, in which was situated the place now called Elphin. The chief of that territory, a noble Druid named Ono, of the royal Connacian race of Hy-Briuin, gave land, and afterwards his castle or fort, to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> to found a church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The place, which had hitherto been called, from its owner's name, <em>Emlagh-Ono,</em> received the designation of Elphin, which signifies "rock of the clear spring", from a large stone raised by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> from the well opened by him in this land and placed on its margin, and the copious stream of crystal water which flowed from it and still flows through the street of Elphin. There <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> called through centuries <em>Tempull Phadruig,</em> i.e. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick's</a> church. He established here an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, and placed over it <a href="../cathen/01800a.htm">St. Assicus</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and with him left Bite, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, son of the brother of Assicus, and Cipia, mother of Bite. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> also founded at Elphin an episcopal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or college, one of the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded by him, and placed Assicus over it, in which office he was succeeded by Bite. Both were buried at Racoon, in Donegal, where <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and a habitation for seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The "Septem episcopide Racoon" are invoked in the Festology of &AElig;ngus the Culdee.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Elphin is described in the "Book of Armagh" as the <em>cerd</em>, i.e. the wright or goldsmith of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>; and he made <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">patens</a>, and metal book-covers for the newly founded churches. Following the example of their masters, the successors and spiritual children of <a href="../cathen/01800a.htm">St. Assicus</a> founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of art and produced beautiful objects of Celtic workmanship in the Diocese of Elphin. Some of these remain to the present day, objects of interest to all who see them. The famous Cross of Cong (see CROSS), undoubtedly one of the finest specimens of its age in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, was (as the inscription on it and the Annals of Innisfallen testify) the work of Mailisa MacEgan, successor of St. Finian of Clooncraff near Elphin, in the County Roscommon, and was made at <a href="../cathen/13190a.htm">Roscommon</a> under the superintendence of Domhnall, son of Flanagan O'Duffy, successor of Coman and Kieran, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Roscommon and Clonmacnoise, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Elphin. It is held that the exquisite Ardagh Chalice, which was given to Clonmacnoise by Turlough O'Conor, and was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> thence by the Danes, was made, if not by the same artist, at least in the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/13190a.htm">Roscommon</a>. The Four Masters record (1166) that the shrine of Manchan of Maothail (Mohill) was covered by Rory O'Conor, and an <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> of gold placed over it by him in as good style as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was ever covered in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. It is, therefore, fair to conclude that this beautiful work was also executed in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of art founded by <a href="../cathen/01800a.htm">St. Assicus</a> in the Diocese of Elphin. Within four miles of the present town of Elphin is Ratherroghan, the famous palace of Queen Meave and the Connaught kings; Relig-na-Righ, the King.' Burial Place; also the well of Ogulla, or the Virgin Monument, the scene of the famous conversion and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Aithnea (Eithne) and Fidelm, the daughters of Leoghari, monarch of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. Ware states that after the union with Elphin of the minor sees of Roscommon, Ardcarne, Drumcliffe, and other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of less note, finally effected by the Synod of Kells (1152), the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was esteemed one of the richest in all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and had about seventy-nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. The Four Masters describe its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as the "Great Church" in 1235, and speak of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> court in 1258. It had a dean and chapter at this time, as we learn from the mandate of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, sent from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 3 July, 1245, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, notifying him that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had annulled the election of the Provost of Roscommon to the See of Elphin, and ordering him to appoint and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Archdeacon John, postulated by the dean Malachy, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> John and Clare, and the treasurer Gilbert.

<p>Among the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was Bron of Killaspugbrone, a favoured disciple of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. He was also the friend and adviser of St. Brigid when she dwelt in the plain of Roscommon and founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> there. According to Ware, of the successors of <a href="../cathen/01800a.htm">St. Assicus</a> in the See of Elphin he found mention of only two before the coming of the English, Domhnall O'Dubhthaigh (O'Duffy), who died in 1036, and Flanachan O'Dubhthaigh, who died in 1168. There is reference to at least two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Elphin, in 640 and 1190. From <a href="../cathen/01800a.htm">St. Assicus</a> to 1909 the names of at least fifty-four occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> are enumerated in the ecclesiastical annals and public records of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Many of them were renowned for learning, wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and subsequent persecutions, there continued in Elphin an unfailing succession of canonically appointed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. They were faithful dispensers of the divine mysteries, like George Brann and John Max; confessors <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and the See of Peter, through years of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and exile like <a href="../cathen/11225c.htm">O'Higgins</a> and O'Crean; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> sealing their testimony with their blood, like O'Healy and Galvirius.

<p>The present Diocese of Elphin includes nearly the whole of the county of Roscommon, with large portions of Sligo and <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>. In the census of 1901 the population was: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 125,743; non-Catholics, 7,661. The present chapter consists of a dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, treasurer, chancellor, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, penitentiary, and four <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> number 33, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> 100. There is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Sligo. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Sligo; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, in various places; and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionaries of Mary, at Loughlynn. To the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> are attached primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attended by 2,500 girls. Three of them have also industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> and homeless children. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> conduct a boarding-school for young ladies. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Immaculate Conception at Sligo. The Marist and <a href="../cathen/12399b.htm">Presentation Brothers</a> teach large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at Sligo, an early Romanesque structure, simple and massive, was erected by Most Rev. Dr. Gillooly, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1897. He also built St. Mary's Presbytery, and the College of the Immaculate Conception, Sligo. These, with a Temperance Hall, form a group of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings worthy of their beautiful scenic surroundings.

<p>Bishop Gillooly was succeeded, 24 March, 1895, by the Most Rev. John Joseph Clancy, born in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Riverstown, County Sligo, in 1856. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Marist College, Sligo, and Summerhill College, Athlone, and entered Maynooth in 1876, where he spent two years on the Dunboyne Establishment. In 1883 he was appointed professor in the Diocesan College, Sligo, and in 1887 professor of English Literature and French in <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, which office he held until he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Elphin.
