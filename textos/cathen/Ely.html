<h1>Ely</h1>  

<p>ANCIENT DIOCESE OF ELY (ELIENSIS; ELIA OR ELYS).

<p>Ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The earliest historical notice of Ely is given by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> who writes (Hist. Eccl., IV, xix): "Ely is in the province of the East Angles, a country of about six hundred <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, in the nature of an island, enclosed either with marshes or waters, and therefore it has its name from the great abundance of eels which are taken in those marshes." This district was assigned in 649 to Etheldreda, or Audrey, daughter of Anna, King of the East Angles, as a dowry in her marriage with Tonbert of the South Girvii. After her second marriage to <a href="../cathen/05327a.htm">Egfrid</a>, King of Northumbria, she became a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, and in 673 returned to Ely and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the site of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. As endowment she gave it her entire principality of the isle, from which subsequent Bishops of Ely derived their temporal power. <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda</a> died in 679, and her shrine became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. In 870 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was destroyed by the Danes, having already given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> four sainted abbesses, Sts. Etheldreda, Sexburga, Ermenilda, and Werburga. Probably under their rule there was a community of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as well as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but when in 970 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was restored by King Edgar and <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">Bishop Ethelwold</a> it was a foundation for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> only. For more than a century the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> flourished, till about the year 1105 Abbot Richard suggested the creation of the See of Ely, to relieve the enormous <a href="../cathen/09266a.htm">Diocese of Lincoln</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> brief erecting the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was issued 21 Nov., 1108, and in Oct., 1109, the king granted his charter, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being Harvey, former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bangor. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> church thus became one of the "conventual" <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. Of this building the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> and two bays of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> already existed, and in 1170 the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> as it stands today (a complete and perfect specimen of late Norman work) was finished. As the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> succeeded to the principality of <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda</a> they enjoyed palatine power and great resources. Much of their wealth they spent on their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, with the result that Ely can show beautiful examples of gothic architecture of every period, including two unique features, the unrivalled <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> (1198-1215) and the central octagon (1322-1328) which rises from the whole breadth of the building and towers up until its roof forms the only Gothic <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> in existence. The western tower (215 feet) was built between 1174 and 1197, and the octagon was added to it in 1400. Of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as a whole it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that "a more vast, magnificent and beautiful display of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">ecclesiastical architecture</a> and especially of the different periods of the pointed style can scarcely be conceived" (Winkles, English Cathedrals, II, 46). It is fortunate in having perfect specimens of each of the successive styles of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>: the Early English <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a>, the Decorated lady-chapel (1321-1349), and the Perpendicular <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> of Bishop Alcock (c. 1500)

<p>The original <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was much smaller than the present <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> see and consisted of Cambridgeshire alone, while even of this county a small part belonged to Norwich diocese. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Ely usually held high office in the State and the roll includes many names of famous statesmen, including eight lord chancellors and six lord treasurers. Two bishops &#151; John de Fontibus and Hugh Belsham &#151; were reputed as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but never received formal cultus; the former was commemorated on 19 June. The following is the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>:--

<ul> <li>Harvey, 1109 <li>Nigel, 1133 (<em>lord treasurer</em>) <li>William Longchamp 1189 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>Eustace, 1198 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>John de Fontibus, 1220 (<em>lord treasurer</em>) <li>Geofrrey de Burgh, 1225 <li>Hugh Norwold, 1229 <li>William de Kilkenny, 1255 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>Hugh Belsham, 1257 <li>John Kirkby, 1286 (<em>lord treasurer</em>) <li>William de Louth, 1290 <li>Ralph Walpole, 1299 <li>Robert Orford, 1302 <li>John Keeton, 1310 <li>John Hotham, 1316 (<em>lord chancellor and lord treasurer</em>) <li>Simon Montacute, 1337 <li>Thomas de Lisle, 1345 <li><a href="../cathen/08788b.htm">Simon Langham</a>*, 1362 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>John Barnet, 1366 (<em>lord treasurer</em>) <li>Thomas Fitz-Alan (or Arundel), 1374 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>John Fordham, 1388 <li>Philip Morgan, 1426 <li>Vacancy (Cardinal Louis of Luxemburg, administrator), 1435 <li><a href="../cathen/02716b.htm">Thomas Bourchier</a>*, 1444 <li>William Gray, 1454 (<em>lord treasurer</em>) <li><a href="../cathen/10582a.htm">John Morton</a>, 1479 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>John Alcock, founder of Jesus College, Cambridge, 1486 <li>Richard Redman, 1501 <li>James Stanley, 1506 <li>Nicholas West, 1515 <li>Thomas Goodrich, 1533 (<em>lord chancellor</em>) <li>Thomas Thirlby, 1554-1559</ul>

<p>Bishop Goodrich showed reforming tendencies and during his pontificate the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with all its dependencies was suppressed. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Thomas Thirlby, who was one of the eleven confessor-bishops <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Elizabeth and who died at Lambeth in 1570. In the diocese there were one archdeaconry and 141 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were: gules, three ducal crowns, or.
