<h1>Elz&eacute;ar-Alexandre Taschereau</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec and first <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, b. 17 February, 1820, at la Beauce, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>; d. 1898, at Quebec. He entered the Seminary of Quebec in 1828, and graduated after brilliant studies in 1836. While pursuing further studies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was on the point of joining the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, owing to his relations with <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a>. He reconsidered his decision, however, and returned to Quebec, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at La Beauce, 10 Sept., 1842, and thenceforth devoted himself to the work of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. He was successively occupied as disciplinarian and professor, and as member of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> council was one of the founders of <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> in 1852. In 1854 he again studied in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, residing at the French Seminary, where he took the degree of Doctor of Canon Law in 1856. He was superior, 1860-66. In 1862 and 1864 he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Laval, and again in 1869, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/02206b.htm">Archbishop Baillargeon</a> during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. In the same year he was re-elected superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and Rector of <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, and in 1871 was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec. In 1886 he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, taking his title from <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Vittoria. He was particularly <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> matters; the Seminary of Quebec found him at all times a devoted protector; he saved from extinction the classical college of Ste. Anne de la Pocati&egrave;re, and aided the growth of new colleges at L&eacute;vis and <a href="../cathen/03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a>.

<p>Mgr. Taschereau's episcopal administration was very fruitful. He founded at Quebec the Sacred Heart Hospital, canonically erected forty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, founded thirty missions, established various devotions, procured the creation of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at <a href="../cathen/03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> more than three hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, convened three provincial councils, and introduced the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> Order into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, giving it charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Patrick, and of the shrine of Ste. Anne de Beaupr&eacute;. He organized the memorable celebration of the second centenary of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new basilica of Ste. Anne de Beaupr&eacute;, and performed the solemn translation of the remains of Mgr. de Laval. He was much devoted to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, to which he paid episcopal visits in 1872, 1884, and 1888. He also welcomed at Quebec on three occasions the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Monsignori Conroy, Smeulders, and Merry del Val. In 1871 he was himself charged with the office of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate in a very important matter concerning <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> ability and literary gifts were of a high order. Though <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give most of his time to administrative matters, he left a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> "History of the Seminary of Quebec"; his published discourses, and pastoral and other letters fill six folio volumes of 900 pages each. Cardinal Taschereau was of a silent disposition, but his speech was always pointed and effective. He was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, who admired his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and dignified bearing.
