<h1>Emanationism</h1>  

<p>The doctrine that emanation (Latin <em>emanare</em>, "to flow from") is the mode by which all things are derived from the First Reality, or Principle.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The term <em>emanation</em>, being itself a metaphor, has been, and is still, used in many senses, and frequently by writers who are not emanationists. Others, without using die word, really hold the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of emanation. Furthermore, emanationism is always interwoven with different opinions on various subjects; to separate it from these so as to assign its fundamental elements is more or less arbitrary. Taking <em>emanationism</em> in the sense commonly received today, it is not primarily a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, but rather a <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> system, not a direct answer to the question of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a>, but to that of the mode of origin of things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In general it holds that all things proceed from the same Divine substance, some immediately, others mediately. All beings form a series the beginning of which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The second reality is an emanation from the first, the third from the second, and so on. At every step the derived being is less perfect than its source; but, by giving rise to other beings, the source itself loses none of its perfections. The first source, then, from which everything flows, remains unchanged; its perfection is neither exhausted nor lessened.

<p>Emanationism is frequently referred to as a form of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>; but while this latter is primarily a system of reality, identifying all things as modes or appearances of the one substance, emanationism is concerned chiefly with the mode of derivation. Nor does it necessarily affirm the substantial identity of all things; it may assert the distinct, though dependent, substantiality of emanated realities. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that emanation is conceived by some in a <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> sense, as an immanent process, an expansion of the Divine substance within itself. But by many it is understood as implying a separation of the derived beings from their source. Hence, not only some forms of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> are not emanationistic, but also many emanationists &mdash; with more or less consistency &mdash; reject <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>. For those who admit that matter is eternal and exists independently of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be more than an architect, who arranges pre-existing materials. In the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of complete emanationism, all things, from the highest spiritual substances to the lowest forms of matter, come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their first origin, matter being the last and therefore most imperfect emanation. Some views, however, combine the theory of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of matter with the theory of emanation.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of creation teaches that all things are distinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is their efficient cause. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not produce things from His own substance nor from any pre-existing reality, but by an act of His will brings them out of nothing. According to emanationism, on the contrary, the Divine substance is the reality from which all things are derived, not by any <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> determination, but by a necessity of nature. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not produce all things immediately; the lower are more distant, and are separated from Him by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> intermediaries. (It may be noted, however, that sometimes the word <em>emanation</em> is used in a broader sense including also <em>creation</em>. Thus <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>: "Qu&aelig;ritur de modo emanationis rerum a primo principio qui dicitur creatio". Summa, I, Q. xlv, a. 1.)

<p>Evolution implies the change of one thing into something else, whereas a reality from which another emanates remains identical with itself. The process of evolution &mdash; at least in its totality &mdash; is generally considered as an ascent, a movement upwards towards a greater perfection. Emanation is a descent; it begins with the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect, and at every step the emanating beings are less pure, less perfect, less divine. The Infinite is postulated as a starting-point, instead of being the goal which the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is ever striving to realize. Some comparisons used by emanationists, though only metaphors, and consequently misleading if taken literally, may give a clearer <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the system. Things proceed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as water from a spring or an overflowing vessel; as the stem, branches, leaves, etc., from the roots; as the web from the spider; as light or heat from the sun or a fire; as the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from the teacher. It is easy to see that all such comparisons are deficient in many points. They are intended simply to illustrate that which is above human comprehension.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>Vague indications of emanationism are found in ancient mythologies and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, especially those of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Thus in the Upanishads things are said to issue from their eternal principle as the web from the spider, the plant from the earth, the hair from the skin. But, while these and other comparisons and expressions may be interpreted in the sense of emanationism, they are not sufficiently explicit to serve as a basis for the assertion that such systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or religion are emanationistic. Philo's teaching on this point is not much clearer. His thought was influenced by two distinct currents: Greek philosophy, especially <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. In his endeavour to reconcile them, he sometimes falls into inconsistencies, and his real position is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. According to him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect, cannot act on the world immediately, but only through powers or forces (<em>pneuma</em>) which are not identical with Him, but proceed from Him. The primitive Divine force is the Logos. Whether the Logos is a substance or only an attribute, remains an obscure point. From the Logos the Spirit (<em>pneuma</em>) proceeds. It is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or vivifying principle, of the world. Sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is looked upon as the efficient and active cause of the world, sometimes also as immanent, as the one and the whole (<em>eis kai to pan autos estin</em>).



<p>The first clear and systematic expression of emanationism is found in the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a>. According to Plotinus, the most important representative of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the first principle of all things is the One. Absolute unity and simplicity is the best expression by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be designated. The One is a totally indetermined essence, for any attribute or determination would introduce both limitation and multiplicity. Even intelligence and will cannot belong to this Primal Reality, for they imply the duality of subject and object, and duality presupposes a higher unity. The One, however, is also described as the First, the Good, the Light, the Universal Cause. From the One all things proceed; not by creation, which would be an act of the will, and therefore incompatible with unity; nor by a spreading of the Divine substance as <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> teaches, since this would do away with the essential oneness. The One is not all things, but before all things. Emanation is the process by which all things are derived from the One. The <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and perfection "overflows", and, while remaining within itself and losing nothing of its own perfection, it generates other beings, sending them forth from its own superabundance. Or again, as brightness is produced by the rays of the sun so everything is a radiation (<em>perilampsis</em>) from the Infinite Light. The various emanations form a series every successive step of which is an image of the preceding one, though inferior to it. The first reality that emanates from the One is the <em>Nous</em>, a pure intelligence, an immanent and changeless thought, putting forth no activity outside of itself. The Nous is an image of the One, and, coming to recognize itself as an image, introduces the first duality, that of subject and object. The Nous includes in itself the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> world, or world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the <em>kosmos nontos</em> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. From the Nous emanates the Soul of the world, which forms the transition between the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the world of the senses. It is intelligent and, in this respect, similar to the ideal world. But it also tends to realize the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in the material world. The World-Soul generates particular <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or rather plastic forces, which are the "forms" of all things. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its particular forces beget matter, which is of itself indetermined and becomes determined by its union with the form. With a few variations in the details, the same essential <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of emanation is taught by Iamblichus and Proclus. With Plotinus, Iamblichus identifies the One with the Good, but assumes an absolutely first One, anterior to the One, and utterly ineffable. From it emanates the One; from the One, the intelligible world (<a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>); and from the intelligible world, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> world (thinking beings). According to Proclus, from the One come the unities (<em>enades</em>), which alone are related to the world. From the unities emanate the triads of the intelligible essences (being), the intelligible-intellectual essences (life), and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> essences (thought). These again are further differentiated. Matter comes directly from one of the intelligible triads.

<p><a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> teach that from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father, emanated numberless Divine, supra-mundane <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, less and less perfect, which, taken all together, constitute the fullness (<em>pleroma</em>) of Divine life. Wisdom, the last of these, produced an inferior wisdom named Achamoth, and also the psychical and material worlds. To denote the mode according to which an inferior is derived from a superior degree, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> uses the term <em>aporroia</em> ("flowing from", "efflux"), and Valentinus, the term <em>probole</em> (throwing forth, projection). The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers, especially when they treat of the divine exemplarism or of the relations of the three Divine Persons in the Trinity, and even when they speak of the origin of the world, may use expressions that remind one of the theory of emanation. But such expressions must be interpreted according to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of creation to which they adhere. <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> follows Plotinus and the later <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonists</a>, especially Proclus, frequently borrowing their terminology. Yet he endeavours to adapt their views to the teachings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is primarily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and other beings are emanations from His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, as light is an emanation from the sun. John Scotus Eriugena takes his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> and interprets it in the sense of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> emanationism. There is only one Being who, by a series of substantial emanations, produces all things. Nature has four divisions, or rather there are four stages of the one nature: <ol><li> The nature which creates, but is not created, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His primordial, incomprehensible reality, unknown and unknowable for all beings, even for Himself. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone truly is, and He is the essence of all things. <li> The created and creating nature, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> considered as containing the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, prototypes, or, to use Eriugena's expression, the primordial causes of things. It is the ideal world. <li> The nature which is created, but does not create, is the world of things existing in time and space. All flow, proceed, or emanate from the first principle of being. Creation is a "procession". Creatures and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are one and the same reality. In creatures <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> manifests Himself. Hence the name <em>theophania</em> which Eriugena gives to this process. <li> Nature, which neither creates nor is created, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the term towards which everything ultimately returns.</ol>

<p>Arabian philosophy &mdash; not to speak here of the various forms of Arabian <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> &mdash; is in many points influenced by <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a>, and generally holds some form of emanationism, the emanation of the different spheres to which all things celestial and terrestrial belong. According to Alfarabi, from the First Being, conceived as intelligent (in this Alfarabi departs from Plotinus), the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> emanates; from the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the cosmic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and from the cosmic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, matter. <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> teaches that matter is eternal and uncreated. From the First Cause comes the <em>intelligentia prima</em>, from which follows a series of processions and emanations of the various celestial spheres down to our own earthly sphere. For <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is not individual, but identical with the universal spirit, which is an emanation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Interesting is a comparison found in one of the later mystics, Ibn Arabi. Water that flows from a vessel becomes separated from it; hence this comparison is defective, for things that issue from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not separated from Him. Emanation is illustrated by the comparison with a mirror, which receives the features of a man, although the man and his features remain united.

<p>In Jewish philosophy, influences of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a> are apparent in <a href="../cathen/02156a.htm">Avicebron</a> and <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>. In the Cabbala the famous <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Sephiroth is essentially a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of emanations. It was developed and systematized especially in the thirteenth century. The Sephiroth are the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> intermediaries between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and the material world. They are divided into three groups, the first group of three forming the world of thought, the second group, also of three, the world of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the last group, of four, the world of matter.
<h2 id="section3">III</h2>

<p>Philosophically the discussion of emanationism supposes the discussion of the whole problem of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a>, especially of His simplicity and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is contained in the definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> by the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> and, especially, the Council of the Vatican. The latter expressly condemns emanationism (I. De Deo rerum omnium creatore, can. iv), and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> those "asserting that finite things, both corporeal and spiritual, or at least spiritual, have "emanated from the Divine substance.
