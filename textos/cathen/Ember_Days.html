<h1>Ember Days</h1>  

<p>Ember days (corruption from Lat. <em>Quatuor Tempora</em>, four times) are the days at the beginning of the seasons ordered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as days of fast and abstinence. They were definitely arranged and prescribed for the entire Church by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> (1073-1085) for the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after 13 December (S. Lucia), after <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, after <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a>, and after 14 September (Exaltation of the Cross). The purpose of their introduction, besides the general one intended by all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, was to thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the gifts of nature, to teach men to make use of them in moderation, and to assist the needy. The immediate occasion was the practice of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Romans were originally given to agriculture, and their native gods belonged to the same class. At the beginning of the time for seeding and harvesting religious ceremonies were performed to implore the help of their <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>: in June for a bountiful harvest, in September for a rich vintage, and in December for the seeding; hence their <em>feriae sementivae, feriae messis</em>, and <em>feri vindimiales</em>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when converting <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations, has always tried to sanctify any practices which could be utilized for a good purpose. At first the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> in June, September, and December; the exact days were not fixed but were announced by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> ascribes to Pope Callistus (217-222) a law ordering: the fast, but probably it is older. <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> (440-461) considers it an Apostolic institution. When the fourth season was added cannot be ascertained, but Gelasius (492-496) speaks of all four. This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also permitted the conferring of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a> on the Saturdays of ember week--these were formerly given only at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Before Gelasius the ember days were known only in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but after his time their observance spread. They were brought into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by St. Augustine; into Gaul and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the Carlovingians. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> adopted them with the Roman Liturgy in the eleventh century. They were introduced by <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> into <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. The present Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, in the formulary for the Ember days, retains in part the old practice of lessons from Scripture in addition to the ordinary two: for the Wednesdays three, for the Saturdays six, and seven for the Saturday in December. Some of these lessons contain promises of a bountiful harvest for those that serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
