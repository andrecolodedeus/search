<h1>Emmaus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in Pal&aelig;stina Prima, suffragan of C&aelig;sarea. It is mentioned for the first time in 166-165 B.C., when <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a> defeated there the army of Gorgias (<a href="../bible/1ma003.htm#vrs40">1 Maccabees 3:40</a>, <a href="../bible/1ma004.htm#vrs25">4:25</a>). A little later the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> general Bacchides fortified and garrisoned it (Josephus, Ant. Jud., XIII, i, 3). In A.D. 4, during the rebellion of Athrongius against the Romans, the inhabitants left their city, which was, nevertheless, destroyed by Varus (Josephus, "Ant. Jud." XVII, x, 7 9; Idem, "Bel. Jud.", II, iv, 3). It soon rose again, for <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Bel. Jud., III, iii, 5) and Pliny (Hist. nat., V, xiv) rank it amongst the "toparchies" of the country. <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> took it at the beginning of his campaign against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, stationed a legion in the neighbourhood, and named it Nicopolis (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.21</a>). According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, this name was given to it only in 223, by <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, its governor and most illustrious son, and this is the name commonly used by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers. Here a spring in which Christ is said to have washed His feet, and which was reputed to cure all diseases, was closed up by order of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.21</a>). Four Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known, from the fourth to the sixth century (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a>, Or. christ., III, 593). At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest the plague broke out in the city, and the inhabitants fled; they must have soon returned, however, for Emmaus remained a very important town. It was the last station of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> on their way to Jerusalem in June, 1099. Eubel (Hierarch. cath., II, 223) has a list of eleven Latin <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but only for the fifteenth century. Today 'Am'was (the native name) is a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> village about eighteen miles from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, on the road to Jaffa. There are still visible ruins of a beautiful <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> built in the fourth or the fifth century, and repaired by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>. Near 'Am'was, at El-Atroun, the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> founded a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> in 1890.

<p>In the opinion of many 'Am'was is the Emmaus of the Gospel (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs13">Luke 24:13-35</a>), where Christ manifested Himself to two of His Disciples. Such is, indeed, the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, attested as early as the fourth century by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a>, <a href="../cathen/14746a.htm">Titus of Bostra</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, a tradition confirmed by all <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, at least to the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>; it may even date back to the third century to <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. It is also supported by many <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">Biblical commentaries</a>, some of which are as old as the fourth or the fifth century; in these the Emmaus of the Gospel is said to have stood at 160 stadia from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the modern 'Am'was being at 176 stadia. In spite of its antiquity, this tradition does not seem to be well founded. Most <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and versions place Emmaus at only sixty stadia from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and they are more numerous and generally more ancient than those of the former group. It seems, therefore, very probable that the number 160 is a correction of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to make the Gospel text agree with the Palestinian tradition of their time. Moreover, the distance of 160 stadia would imply about six hours' walk, which is inadmissible, for the Disciples had only gone out to the country and could return to Jersualem before the gates were shut (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs12">Mark 16:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs33">Luke 24:33</a>). Finally, the Emmaus of the Gospel is said to be a village, while 'Am'was was the flourishing capital of a "toparchy". <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant. Jud., VII, vi, 6) mentions at sixty stadia from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a village called Ammaus, where <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> and Titus stationed 800 veterans. This is evidently the Emmaus of the Gospel. But it must have been destroyed at the time of the revolt of Bar-Cocheba (A.D. 132 35) under Hadrian, and its site was unknown as early as the third century. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and his friends merely placed the Gospel Emmaus at Nicopolis, the only Emmaus known at their time. The identifications of Koubeibeh, Abou Gosh, Koulonieh, Beit Mizzeh, etc. with Emmaus, as proposed by some modern scholars, are inadmissible.
