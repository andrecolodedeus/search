<h1>Encolpion</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>egkolpion</em>, that which is worn on the breast).

<p>The name given in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times to a species of <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> worn round the neck, in which were enclosed <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> as fragments of cloth stained with the blood of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, small pieces of parchment with texts from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, particles of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, etc.

<p>The custom of bearing on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> objects of this character was evidently derived from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> practice of wearing <em>bullae</em>, containing amulets, round the neck as a protection against enchantment; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> endeavoured to purify this usage from <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> by substituting objects <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for those to which they had been accustomed before conversion. According to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, however (in Matt., c. xxiii), some of the faithful in his day attached a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> importance to these aids to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; he censures certain classes of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who seem to have, in some degree, identified <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> with an exaggerated veneration for <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a>: "Hoc quod apud nos superstitiosae mulierculae in parvulis evangeliis et in crucis ligno et istiusmodi rebus, quae habent quidem zelum Dei, sed non secundum scientiam, factitant" (That which <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> amongst us, who have a certain <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but not of right <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, do in regard to little copies of the Gospels, the wood of the cross, and things of that kind). Encolpia were of various forms, oval, round, four-cornered, and of various materials ranging from gold to glass. In 1571 two gold encolpia, square in form, were found in <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the ancient Vatican cemetery, engraved on one side with the monogram of Christ between the <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a>, and on the other with a dove. Another, now lost, was found in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Maria, wife of the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a>, bearing the names of the imperial couple with the legend VIVATIS and the monogram. The famous treasure of Monza contains the <em>theca persica</em>, enclosing a text from the Gospel of St. John, sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604) to Queen Theodolinda for her son Adalaold. Another of the gifts of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the Lombard queen was a cruciform encolpion containing a portion of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. Probably the most interesting <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of this form is a gold <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> discovered at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1863, in the basilica of S. Lorenzo (<em>fuori le mura</em>), on the breast of a corpse. On one side it bears the inscription: EMMANOTHA NOBISCUM DEUS (Emmanuel, God with us), and on the other: CRUX EST VITA MIHI, MORS INIMICE TIBE (To me the Cross is life; to thee, O enemy, it is death). To the category of encolpia belong also the vials or vessels of clay in which were preserved such esteemed <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> as oil from the lamps that burned before the Holy Sepulchre and the golden keys with filings from St. Peter's chains, one of which was sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> King Childebert.
