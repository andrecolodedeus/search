<h1>Encratites</h1>  

<p>[<em>&rsquo;Egkrate&#238;s</em> (Iren&aelig;us) <em>&rsquo;Egkratetai</em> (Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus)].

<p>Literally, "abstainers" or "persons who practised continency", because they refrained from the use of wine, animal food, and marriage. The name was given to an early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, or rather to a tendency common to several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, chiefly <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, whose asceticism was based on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> views regarding the origin of matter.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>Abstinence from the use of some creatures, because they were thought to be intrinsically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is much older than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorism</a>, Essenism, Indian asceticism betrayed this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> tendency, and the Indian ascetics are actually quoted by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> as the forerunners of the Encratites (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.15</a>). Although <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> refers to people, even in his days, "forbidding to marry and abstaining from meats" (<a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs1">1 Timothy 4:1-5</a>), the first mention of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of this name occurs in Iren&aelig;us (I, xxviii). He connects their origin with Saturninus and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. Rejecting marriage, they implicitly accuse the Creator, Who made both male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>. Refraining from all <em>&rsquo;&eacute;mpsucha</em> (animal food and intoxicants), they are ungrateful to Him Who created all things. "And now", continues Iren&aelig;us, "they reject the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the first man [Adam]; an opinion recently introduced among them by <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>. As long as he was with <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> he gave no sign of these things, but after his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> separated himself from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Elated and puffed up by his professorship, he established some teaching of his own. He fabled about some invisible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>, as the Valentinians do; and proclaimed marriage to be corruption and fornication, as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Saturninus do, but he made the denial of Adam's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> a specialty of his own." The Encratites are next mentioned by Clement of Alexandria (<a href="../fathers/02092.htm"><em>The Pedagogue</em> II.33</a>; <a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.15</a>; <a href="../fathers/02107.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VII.17</a>). The whole of the third book of the Stromata is devoted to combating a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <em>encrateia,</em> or continency, though a special <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Encratites is not there mentioned. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (Philos., VIII, xiii) refers to them as "acknowledging what concerns <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ in like manner with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; in respect, however, of their mode of life, passing their days inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>"; "abstaining from animal food, being water-drinkers and forbidding to marry"; "estimated Cynics rather than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>". On the strength of this passage it is supposed that some Encratites were perfectly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> only in practice, but <em>t&#224; per&#236; to&#251; theo&#251; ka&#236; to&#251; christo&#251;</em> need not include the whole of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. Somewhat later this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> received new life and strength by the accession of a certain Severus (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.29</a>), after whom Encratites were often called Severians. These Severian Encratites accepted the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospels, but rejected the Book of the Acts and cursed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and his Epistles. But the account given by Epiphanius of the Severians rather betrays Syrian <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> than Judaistic tendencies. In their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of marriage they declared <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the work of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and in their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of intoxicants they called wine drops of venom from the great Serpent, etc. (H&aelig;r., xiv). Epiphanius states that in his day Encratites were very numerous throughout <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, in Psidia, in the Adustan district of Phrygia, in Isauria, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Galatia. In the Roman Province and in Antioch of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> they were found scattered here and there. They split up into a number of smaller <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of whom the <a href="../cathen/01647a.htm">Apostolici</a> were remarkable for their condemnation of private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Hydroparastat&aelig;</a> for their use of water instead of wine in the Eucharist. In the Edict of 382, <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> pronounced sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> on all those who took the name of Encratites, Saccophori, or <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Hydroparastat&aelig;</a>, and commanded Florus, the <em>Magister Officiarum,</em> to make strict search for these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in disguise. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (<a href="../fathers/26025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.11</a>) tells of an Encratite of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> in Galatia, called Busiris, who <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> submitted to torments in the <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and who under <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On the other hand, we learn from Macarius Magnes (about 403&mdash;Apocr., III, xliii) of a certain <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, a Cilician, who about the same time wrote a work in eight books in defence of Encratite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. About the middle of the fifth century they disappear from history, absorbed, probably, by the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, with whom they had so much in common from the first.
<h2 id="section2">Writings</h2>

<p>The Encratites developed a considerable literary activity. The earliest writer in their defence probably was <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> in his book "Concerning Perfection according to the Saviour", which <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> quotes and refutes in <a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.12</a>. Almost contemporary with him (about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 150) was Julius Cassianus, known as the founder of <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetism</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">D<font size=-2>OCET&#198;</font></a>). He wrote a work "Concerning Self-restraint and Continency", of which Clement and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> have preserved some passages (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.21</a>; Euseb., Praep. Ev., X, xii; <a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.13</a>; Jerome, ad Gal., VI, viii). Concerning the eight books of <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only that he maintained that, as the world had its beginning by sexual intercourse, so by continency (<em>encrateia</em>) it would have its end; and that he inveighed against wine-drinkers and flesh-eaters. Among the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> works which originated in Encratite circles must be mentioned: The Gospel according to the Egyptians, referred to by Clement (<a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.9.13</a>), <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. in i Luc.), <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (Philos., V, vii), which contained a dialogue between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and Salome specially appealed to by the Encratites in condemnation of marriage (to this Gospel the recently discovered "Logia" probably belong); the Gospel of Philip, of Thomas, the Acts of Peter, of Andrew, of Thomas, and other Apocrypha, furthering Gnostic-Encratite views.

<p><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.21.28</a>) says that Musanus (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 170 or 210) wrote a most elegant book addressed to some brethren who had fallen into the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Encratites. Theodoret (H&aelig;r. Fab., I, xxi) says that Apollinaris of Hierapolis in Phrygia (about 171) wrote against the Severian Encratites.
