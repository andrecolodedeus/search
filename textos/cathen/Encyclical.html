<h1>Encyclical</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Litter&oelig; Encyclic&oelig;</em>)

<p>According to its etymology, an encyclical (from the Greek <em>egkyklios, kyklos</em> meaning a circle) is nothing more than a circular letter. In modern times, usage has confined the term almost exclusively to certain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents which differ in their technical form from the ordinary style of either <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> or Briefs, and which in their superscription are explicitly addressed to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Universal Church in communion with the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. By exception, encyclicals are also sometimes addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a particular country. Thus this name is given to the letter of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (6 Jan., 1907) to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in spite of the fact that it was published, not in Latin, but in French; while, on the other hand, the letter "Longinqua Oceani" (5 Jan., 1895) addressed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, is not styled an encyclical, although in all other respects it exactly observes the forms of one. From this and a number of similar facts we may probably infer that the precise designation used is not intended to be of any great significance. From the nature of the case encyclicals addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world are generally concerned with matters which affect the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large. They condemn some prevalent form of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, point out dangers which threaten <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, exhort the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to constancy, or prescribe remedies for evils foreseen or already existent. In form an encyclical at the present day begins thus &#151; we may take the encyclical <a href="../library/docs_pi10pd.htm">"Pascendi"</a> on <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a> as a specimen: --

<p>"Sanctissimi Domini Nostri Pii Divin&acirc; Providenti&acirc; Pap&aelig; X Litter&aelig; Encyclic&aelig; ad Patriarchas, Primates, Archiepiscopos, Episcopos aliosque locorum Ordinarios pacem et communionem cum Apostolic&acirc; Sede habentes de Modernistarum Doctrinis. Ad Patriarchas, Primates, Archiepiscopos, Episcopos aliosque locorum Ordinarios, pacem et communionem cum Apostolic&acirc; Sede habentes, Pius PP. X., Venerabiles Fratres, salutem et apostolicam benedictionem. Pascendi dominici gregis mandatum", etc.

<p>The conclusion takes the following form: &#151; "Nos vero, pignus caritatis Nostr&aelig; divinique in adversis solatii, Apostolicam Benedictionem vobis, cleris, populisque vestris amantissime impertimus. Datum Rom&aelig;, apud Sanctum Petrum, die VIII Septembris MCMVII, Pontificatus Nostri anno quinto. Pius PP. X."

<p>Although it is only during the last three pontificates that the most important utterances of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> have been given to the world in the shape of encyclicals, this form of Apostolic Letter has long been in occasional use. Almost the first document published by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> after his election was an "Epistola encyclica et commonitoria" on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the episcopal office (3 Dec., 1740). Under <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> many momentous utterances were presented in this shape. The famous pronouncement "Quanta cura" (8 Dec., 1864), which was accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/14368b.htm">Syllabus</a> of eighty <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, was an encyclical. Another important encyclical of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, described as an "Encyclical of the Holy Office", was that beginning "Suprem&aelig;" (4 Aug., 1856) in condemnation of <a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">Spiritualism</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> published a series of encyclicals on social and other questions which attracted universal attention. We may mention especially "Inscrutabilis" (21 April, 1878) on the evils of modern <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; "&AElig;terni Patris" (4 Aug., 1879) on <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>; "Arcanum divin&aelig; sapienti&aelig;" (10 Feb., 1880) on <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life; "Diuturnum illud" (29 June, 1881) on the origin of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>; "Immortale Dei" (1 Nov., 1885) on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> constitution of states; "Libertas pr&aelig;stantissimum" (20 June, 1888) on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> liberty; "Rerum novarum" (16 May, 1891) on the labour question; "Providentissimus Deus" (18 Nov., 1893) on <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; "Satis cognitum" (29 June, 1896) on religious unity. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> has shown the same favour for this form of document, e.g. in his earnest commendation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction "Acerbo nimis" (15 April, 1906) his address on the centenary of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (12 March, 1904), his first letter to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, "Vehementer nos" (11 Feb., 1906), his instructions on intervention in politics to the people of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in the <a href="../library/docs_pi10pd.htm">pronouncement on Modernism</a> already mentioned.

<p>Two officials presiding over separate bureaux still count it among their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to aid the Holy Father in the drafting of his encyclical letters. These are the "Segretario dei brevi ai Principi" assisted by two <em>minutanti</em>, and the "Segretario delle lettere Latine" also with a minutante. But it was undoubtedly the habit of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to write his own encyclicals, and it is plainly within the competence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> to dispense with the services of any subordinates.

<p>As for the binding force of these documents it is generally admitted that the mere fact that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should have given to any of his utterances the form of an encyclical does not necessarily constitute it an ex-cathedra pronouncement and invest it with <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> authority. The degree in which the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">infallible magisterium</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is committed must be judged from the circumstances, and from the language used in the particular case. In the early centuries the term encyclical was applied, not only to <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>, but to certain letters emanating from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and directed to their own flocks or to other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Such letters addressed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to all his subjects in general are now commonly called pastorals. Amongst <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, however, the name <em>encyclical</em> has recently been revived and applied, in imitation of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> usage, to circular letters issued by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>. Thus the reply of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> condemnation of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a> (this condemnation, "Apostolic&aelig; Cur&aelig;", took the form of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>) was styled by its authors the Encyclical "S&aelig;pius officio".

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Little has been written professedly on the subject of encyclicals, which in treatises on canon law are generally grouped with other Apostolic Letters. The work of BENCINI, <em>De Literis Encyclicis Dissertatio</em> (Turin, 1728), deals almost exclusively with the early church documents which were so styled; see, however, HILGENREINER in <em>Kirchliches Handlexikon</em> (Munich, 1907), I, 1310; and GOYAU, <em>Le Vatican</em> (Paris, 1898), p. 336; WYNNE, <em>The Great Encyclical Letters of Leo XIII</em> (New York. 1903); EYRE, <em>The Pope and the People</em> (London, 1897); and D' ARROS, <em>L&eacute;on XIII d'apr&egrave;s ses Encycliques</em> (Paris, 1902). On the authority of encyclicals and similar papal documents, see especially the very useful book of CHOUPIN, <em>Valeur des D&eacute;cisions Doctrinales et Disciplinaires du Saint-Si&egrave;ge</em> (Paris, 1907); cf. BAINVEL, <em>De Magisterio vivo et Traditione</em> (Paris, 1905).</p></div>
