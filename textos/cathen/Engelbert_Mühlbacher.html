<h1>Engelbert M&uuml;hlbacher</h1>  

<p>An historian, born at Gresten, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 4 Oct., 1843; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 17 July, 1903. He received his classical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> native city. In 1862 he became a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> among the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a> at St. Florian. After completing his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies there, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1867. As Arneth relates in his memoirs, historical studies had been successfully cultivated at St. Florian's since Provost Arneth's time, and M&uuml;hlbacher was soon active in this domain. Among his writings are articles on St. Florian's Gerhoh von Reichersberg, and the literary productions of St. Florian's. In 1872 we find M&uuml;hlbacher studying under <a href="../cathen/06068a.htm">Julius Ficker</a> at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, where after two years he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. He then hastened to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to finish his historical training under Sickel's guidance. When <a href="../cathen/06068a.htm">Ficker</a> entrusted the youthful scholar with the revision of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period of B&ouml;hmer's "Regesta", he was directing him to a domain in which he was to do imperishable work. In 1878 he was formally received as academical lecturer into the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a>, and between 1880 and 1889 published his masterly edition of the imperial "Regesta" of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period. As Redlich says, "the technique of compiling regesta received exemplary development at M&uuml;hlbacher's hands, and his work served as a model for the entire new edition of the imperial "Regesta". In 1892 M&uuml;hlbacher was entrusted with the editing of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> documents for the "Monumenta Germani&aelig; Historica". At the same time it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to bring out a new edition of his <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> "Regesta". The two works <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of mutual assistance, and M&uuml;hlbacher devoted the greatest care and diligence to his tasks. He was able to see only the first part of each work through the press, but left considerable material for the use of his successors. No other German scholar was so well qualified to write the "Deutsche Geschichte unter den Karolingern", which appeared in 1896. Since 1879 M&uuml;hlbacher edited the "Mitteilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichtsforschung". In 1881 he was appointed extraordinary, and in 1896 ordinary professor at <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna</a>. In 1895 <a href="../cathen/06068a.htm">Ficker</a> turned over to him the management of the "Regesta Imperii". With the utmost energy he took in hand the arrangement of the Austrian State Archives, and the preparation of the more recent history of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. His learning and efforts did not fail to receive due recognition. He was chosen an active member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. M&uuml;hlbacher's unwearying labours continued until his all too early death.
