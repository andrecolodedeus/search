<h1>English Confessors and Martyrs (1534-1729)</h1>  

<p>Though the resistance of the English as a people to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> compares very badly with the resistance offered by several other nations, the example given by those who did stand firm is remarkably interesting and instructive. (1) They suffered the extreme penalty for maintaining the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and the Supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines</a> most impugned by the reformation in all lands, and at all times. (2) They maintained their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> almost entirely by the most modern methods, and they were the first to so maintain it, i.e., by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth in colleges, at the risk, and often at the cost of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. (3) The tyranny they had to withstand was, as a rule, not the sudden <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of a tyrant, but the continuous oppression of <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">laws</a> sanctioned by the people in Parliament, passed on the specious plea of political and national necessity, and operating for centuries with an almost irresistible force which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> acquires when acting for generations in conservative and law-abiding counties. (4) The study of their causes and their <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">acts</a> is easy. The number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are many; their trials are spread over a long time. We have in many cases the papers of the prosecution as well as those of the defense, and the voice of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is frequently heard pronouncing on the questions of the debate, and declaring that this or that matter is essential, on which no compromise can be permitted; or by her silence she lets it be understood that some other formula may pass.
<h2>The cause of the beatification</h2>

<p>The cause of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of the English Martyrs is important not for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> only, but for all missionary countries, where its precedents may possibly be followed. The English cause is a very ancient one. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, between 1580 and 1585, made several important <em>viva voce</em> concessions. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> might, in default of others, be used to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> altars, a <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> might be publically sung on the receipt of the news of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, and their pictures with their names attached might be placed in the church of the English College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. These permissions were given without any systematic inquiry that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of. <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Pope Urban VII</a>, in 1642, commenced such an inquiry, and though the outbreak of the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in 1642 postponed indefinitely the public progress of the cause, a list was drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, <a href="../cathen/14059a.htm">Dr. Richard Smith</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, which was subsequently amplified and published by <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Dr. Richard Challoner</a>. It was not until 1855 that the cause was revived, when <a href="../cathen/10576c.htm">Canon John Morris</a> (a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> after 1866) became its apostle. After several unsuccessful petitions, as that of the Third Synod of Westminster in 1859, to obtain an immediate sanction for their cultus by papal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, a formal "ordinary process" was held in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, June to September, 1874. The work was one of much difficulty, first because nothing of the sort had been attempted in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> before, and secondly because of the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Largely, however, through the public spirit of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Oratory, who devoted themselves to it unitedly; success was achieved, both in gathering together a body of evidence, and in fulfilling the multifarious ceremonial precautions on which the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> jurists so strongly insist. After the cause had been for twelve years in the Roman courts, two decrees were issued which, broadly speaking, gave full force and efficacy to the two ancient papal ordinations before mentioned (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">BEATIFICATION AND CANONIZATION</a>).

<p>Thus <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory's</a> concession resulted in the equivalent <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of sixty-three <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> mentioned by name in the pictures (at first, in 1888, fifty-four were admitted; in 1895, eight more were added, with one not in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> pictures), while the lists drawn up by Bishops <a href="../cathen/14059a.htm">Smith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Challoner</a> led to the "admission of the cause" of two hundred and forty-one <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (all but twelve post-Gregorian), who are therefore called "Venerables". Forty-four were left with their fate still in suspense, and are called <em>Dilati</em>. Except seven, these are all "Confessors", who certainly died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though it is not yet proven that they died precisely because of their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. There is yet another class to be described. While the foregoing cause was pending, great progress was being made with the arrangement of papers in the Public Record Office of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, so that we now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> immeasurably more of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and its victims than before the cause began. In short, over 230 additional sufferers seem possibly worthy of being declared <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. They are called <em>Pr&aelig;termissi</em>, because they were passed over in the first cause. A new cause was therefore held at Westminster (September, 1888, to August, 1889), and the proceedings have been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For reasons which it is not necessary to touch upon here, it was thought best to include every possible claimant, even those of whom there was very little definite information, and the far-reaching cause of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Queen Mary Stuart</a>. This, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a tactical mistake. An obscure cause needs as much attention as a clear cause, or more. Moreover, the Roman courts are, on the one hand, so short-handed, that they grudge giving men to a work which will lead to little result, and on the other hand they are overwhelmed with causes which certainly need attention. In order to facilitate progress, therefore, the cause has been split up; the case of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Queen Mary</a> has been handed over to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and other simplifications have been attempted; nevertheless the cause of the <em>Pr&aelig;termissi</em> so far hangs fire. <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> for a <em>Processus de Scriptus</em> were issued by the Sacred Congregation on Rites on 24 March, 1899, ordering the then <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Archbishop of Westminster</a> to gather up copies of all the extant writings of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> declared Venerable. This proved a lengthy task, and when complete, the collection comprised nearly 500 <em>scripta</em>, and over 2000 pages. It was not completed till 17 June, 1904. Then, by special concession, four censors were appointed to draw up a special <em>censura</em> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and this was forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, after further consideration, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was drawn up and confirmed by the Pope on 2 March, 1906, declaring that none of the writings produced would hinder the cause of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> now under discussion. In the course of the same year a further <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was obtained allowing altars for the <em>beati</em>, but not without many restrictions.
