<h1>English Post-Reformation Oaths</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> having been imposed by the Crown, it was natural that submission to the essential points of its formularies should have been exacted with some solemnity, by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, test, or formal declaration, and that these should change with the varying moods of those who dominated in the State.

<h2 id="i">Oath of royal supremacy (1534)</h2>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was imposed in March 1534 (26 Henry VIII, c. 1). The title "Supreme Head" had first been introduced by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> into a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of convocation, 11 February, 1531; and had been strenuously resisted by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Though it did not as yet have any religious significance, and might be a matter of compliment only, it might, they feared, receive another interpretation later. But acting under the advice of <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Fisher</a>, <a href="../cathen/15554a.htm">Warham</a>, and others, whose <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> is above suspicion, they submitted after adding the conditional phrase, "quantum per legem Dei licet". Two years later a change had taken place, which had previously seemed inconceivable. The king had actually broken with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Parliament had enacted that the king should be "taken, accepted and reputed the only supreme head on Earth of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">church of England</a>" by every one of his subjects. But no formula for the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was laid down in the Act, and great differences seem to have prevailed in practice. Many long "acknowledgments of supremacy" are extant (Camm, "English Martyrs", I, 401) but it would seem that most people were only asked to swear to the Succession, that is to the king's marriage with Anne Boleyn, which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned, and which therefore involved the supremacy, though the form of the Oath of Succession preserved in <em>The Lord.' Journals</em>, refers to the supremacy with insidious lightness. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was its from, when <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Fisher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a> refused to sign it. They were ready to accept the succession of Anne Boleyn's children, but refused the supremacy (<a href="../cathen/02782b.htm">Bridgett</a>, <em>infra</em> 264-86).

<p>The Act of Supremacy was repealed by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> (1 Ph. and M. c. 8) and revived by Elizabeth (1 Eliz. c. 1). The formula then adopted ran: "I, A.B., do utterly testify and declare in my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, that the Queen's Highness is the only supreme Governor of the Realm . . . as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or causes as Temporal, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. So help me <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." This was not to be proposed at once to every one; but was to be taken by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and by all holding office under the Crown; by others, when asked. This moderation in exacting the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> helped to prevent an outcry against it, and enabled the Government to deal with the recalcitrant in detail. Many years elapsed, for instance, before it was imposed on the graduates of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed by Elizabeth against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (1592-3) enjoined a new test for <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">Recusants</a> (35 Eliz. c. 2). It comprised (1) A confession of "grievous offence against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in contemning her Majesty's Government"; (2) Royal Supremacy; (3) A clause against <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> and dissimulations, perhaps the first of its sort in <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> of this class. The success of Elizabeth's "settlement of religion", had been really due to her alliance with the party afterwards called <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>, and they were not in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with the supremacy, or unaware that it was unpopular and tyrannical.

<p>In order to excuse their persecutions they therefore preferred (especially after the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the queen) to make an informal test by asking the suspected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whether he would fight against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, if he sent an army to restore <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> called this the "bloody question". There was no law to enforce an answer, there was no specific penalty for refusal. But those who refused to answer, were decried as traitors; and then proceeded against to the uttermost by other persecuting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Those who in their answers showed any loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were in the same plight, a mark for <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> till they bent or broke. But those who answered disrespectfully, were treated less cruelly.

<p>Towards the end of Elizabeth's reign, a split began in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ranks on this subject. Some of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had joined in the well-known Appeal against the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Blackwell had afterwards presented to Elizabeth a "Protestation of Allegiance" (<a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>-Dodd, <em>infra</em>, iii, Ap. 188). Declarations of loyalty there had been before in plenty: those made by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> being often extraordinarily touching. But the signatories of 1603, perhaps stimulated by the Cisalpine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, for the Protestation was drawn up in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, besides protesting their loyalty, went on to withhold from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> any possible exercise of the deposing power. Before this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> loyalists had only denied the validity of the deposition pronounced by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. Several reasons seemed to justify this Protestation, at the time it was made (see <a href="../cathen/02589a.htm">W<font size=-2>ILLIAM</font> B<font size=-2>ISHOP</font></a>), though unfortunate developments followed later.

<h2 id="ii">Oath of allegiance of James I (1606)</h2>

<p>Also called the O<font size=-2>ATH OF</font> O<font size=-2>BEDIENCE</font>. After the <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a> a systematic effort was made to persecute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at every turn from the cradle to the grave, by penalizing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, burials, as well as <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, acquisition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, &amp;c. An attempt was also made to divide and disgrace <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the matter of allegiance. It was known, from the "Protestation", that there were differences of opinion on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> deposing power, and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance was drafted to make capital out of those differences (for the authorship of the formula, see Thurston infra, and <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>-Dodd, iv. 71). The more important clauses are the following:--"I, A.B., do truly and sincerely acknowledge, &amp;c. that our sovereign lord, King James, is lawful and rightful King &amp;c. and that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> neither of himself nor by any authority of Church or <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>, or by any other means with any other, has any power to depose the king &amp;c., or to authorize any foreign prince to invade him &amp;c., or to give licence to any to bear arms, raise tumults, &amp;c. &amp;c. Also I do swear that notwithstanding any sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> or deprivation I will bear allegiance and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to his Majesty &amp;c. &amp;c. And I do further swear that I do from my heart abhor, detest, and <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a>, as impious and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> this damnable <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and position,--that princes which be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may be deposed or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by their subjects or by any other whatsoever. And I do believe that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has no power to absolve me from this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. I do swear according to the plain and common sense, and understanding of the same words &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c" (3 James I, c. 4). This <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was proclaimed law on 22 June, 1606.


<h3>Objections</h3>

<p>On 22 September following the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned the formula, "It cannot be taken, as it contains many things evidently contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." It was prudent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, not to attempt to enumerate the objectionable points, for this would have increased the tension, and it is even now difficult to specify them, partly because of the ambiguity of the terms used; partly because of the deceitful interpretation put upon them by the English authorities. For James now <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritically</a> asserted that his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was not meant to encroach upon anyone's conscientious convictions. Hereupon minimizers began to maintain that the words of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> might be interpreted by the intention of the law-giver, that the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> might therefore be taken. But it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> here to advert to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> in <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>. These we believe to be addressed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself and to be accepted in the precise sense of the words pronounced. If King James had made his subjects swear specifically "in the sense by him explained", the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> might perhaps have been endured, but when he made them "swear according to the plain and common sense, and understanding of the same words", to what was injurious to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consciences, this could not be tolerated. Of the many objections raised against the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> the following are perhaps the chief.

<h4 id="i">Objectionable words</h4>

<p>The most objectionable words were those in which the deposing power was sworn to be "impious, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and damnable." In previous centuries generations and generations of loyal subjects, and numberless patriots and lawyers, and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (with exceptions, of course, but upon the whole in a large majority) had considered that this power was a valuable safeguard for liberty both religious and civil. In later days some people might think it out of date, inapplicable, extinct, perhaps even a mistake. But to call <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness that one execrated it as "impious, heretical and damnable", was what no God-fearing adherent of the old Faith, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what he said and to whom he spoke, could conscientiously do. Indeed anyone who carefully weighs the terms of this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, will see that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the pontiff are so unreservedly denied, that no room whatsoever is left for the assertion of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberties. This shows the affinities of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> with Gallicanism, which was acquiring such vogue upon the continent in those days. The Sorbonne, on 30 June, 1681, very shortly before approving the Gallican articles, censored the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and found in it very little to object to (Butler, I, 351). The words here under discussion also evidently presume that he who takes the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> believes in the "Divine right of kings".

<h4 id="ii">The deposing power</h4>

<p>While all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> would condemn the extreme statements just mentioned, as to the deposing power, there were also many at that time, and they of the highest name, who considered any denial of that power as illicit. Two or three generations only had passed since the discipline of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> deposition for extreme case of misgovernment had been generally accepted. In some parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> it was still the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Many, and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> with his <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> ideals was among them, had not yet perceived that this discipline would never be in vogue again, even in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. This explains why <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a>, and several other early opponents of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> went further in their condemnation of it than later <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> would have done. At the same time it is a mistake to suppose that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> resistance to the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was chiefly or solely due to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the deposing power. This statement, however, is often made by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (e.g., Hallam) and also by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, like <a href="../cathen/12402a.htm">Preston</a> and others who wrote in defence of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, or who had Gallican leanings, such as Charles Butler and <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Canon Tierney</a> (Butler, I, 359, 396; IV, 120, &amp;c.; <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>-Dodd, IV, 78 n., 81 n.). We have seen on the contrary that there were from the first English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11099a.htm">Non-jurors</a> who explicitly rejected the deposing power. <a href="../cathen/02589a.htm">Doctor William Bishop</a>, for instance, did this, but still underwent <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for refusing the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; and he was afterwards made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<h4 id="iii">Fraudulent object of the oath</h4>

<p>It was always known that the loyalty of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body was unimpeachable. The reign of Charles I and the fall of the Stuarts showed that it was really far stronger than that of any other religious body. The Oath of Allegiance was designed to obscure this. As a man's repute for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> may be impaired by prolonged examination on the subject of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation and the like, and by exacting <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> about truthfulness, so these elaborate protests against the deposing power were intended to throw <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon the loyalty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and so to divide and disgrace them, and this it actually did. Like all religious tests imposed by enemies it was something, not to amend, but to avoid altogether.

<h4 id="iv">The dishonour to the Holy See</h4>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and all those of a similar character amount to a statement beforehand of "the conditions under which the Holy See will be disobeyed", and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has ever considered such proposals as dishonourable to herself, just as a nation would consider it a disgrace to lay down beforehand the terms under which her soldiers were to capitulate.

<h4 id="v">The controversy</h4>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Blackwell, then head of the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, had at first disapproved of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, then allowed it, then after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> disallowed it again, and finally being arrested and thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, relying on James's statement that no encroachment on <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was intended, and recommended the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to do the like. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at once issued a new <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> (23 August, 1607), repeating his prohibition, and on 28 Sept., 1607, Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> wrote to Blackwell exhorting him to obey the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> at any cost. As this also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> ineffectual a new <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, George Birkhead, or Birkett, was appointed 1-10 Feb., 1608, and Blackwell was informed that his faculties would be taken away if he did not retract in two months. This, however, he still refused to do, and, much to King James's satisfaction, continued to defend his opinion for three years before he was finally suspended. Blackwell's example, as may be imagined, had but too great an influence, and he found successors in his unfortunate apostolate for many a year afterwards.

<p>Meantime James had himself undertaken to answer the missives sent to Blackwell. This he did anonymously in a tract with the quaint title, "Triplici nodo, triplex cuneus" ("A triple wedge for a triple knot", i.e., for two Briefs and the Cardinal's letter). This was answered by <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, also anonymously, "Responsio ad librum: Triplici nodo, triplex cuneus" (1608). James now dropped his anonymity, and reprinted his tract with a "Premonition to Christian Princes", and an appendix on his adversaries' supposed mistakes (Jan., 1609). Upon this, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> published, now also using his own name, his "Apologia pro responsione ad librum Jacobi I" (1609). James opposed to this a treatise by a learned Scottish <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, <a href="../cathen/02291c.htm">W. Barclay</a>, "De potestate papf" (1609). <a href="../cathen/02291c.htm">Barclay</a> was a decided Gallican, and <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine's</a> answer, "Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in rebus temporalibus" (1610), gave such offence to the gallicanizing party in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, that it was publicly burnt in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 26 Nov., 1610. A similar fate befell Father Francisco Su&aacute;rez's answer to James through an <em>arr&ecirc;t</em> of 26 June, 1614; but this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was eventually withdrawn at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At every stage of the contest between the two champions a host of minor combatants joined the fray. Here it must suffice to enumerate the chief names.

<h4 id="vi">Subsequent history</h4>

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the pressure caused by the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> may be gathered from the Acts of the Venerable <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, <a href="../cathen/05165a.htm">Drury</a>, <a href="../cathen/02051b.htm">Atkinson</a>, <a href="../cathen/01328c.htm">Almond</a>, <a href="../cathen/14711a.htm">Thulis</a>, <a href="../cathen/05293b.htm">Arrowsmith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07583a.htm">Herst</a>, <a href="../cathen/06536a.htm">Gervase</a>, <a href="../cathen/06388a.htm">Thomas Garnett</a>, Gavan, and Heath; the last two have left writings against it. Another illustration will be found in the history of the first Lord Baltimore, whose attempt to settle in <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> had been introduced in 1609, was defeated by it. The second Lord Baltimore, on the other hand, ordered his adventurers to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, but whether he insisted on this is uncertain (Hughes, "Soc. of Jesus in N. America", pp. 260-1, 451 and <em>passim</em>). King Charles I generally recognized that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could not conscientiously take the Oath of Supremacy, and frequently exerted his prerogative to help them to avoid it. On the other hand his theory of the Divine right of kings induced him to favour the Oath of Allegiance, and he was irritated with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who refused it or argued against it. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> is said to have condemned the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> again in 1626 (Reusch, 327), and the controversy continued. <a href="../cathen/12402a.htm">Preston</a> still wrote in its defence; so also, at King Charles's order, did Sir William Howard (1634); this was probably the <a href="../cathen/07504a.htm">future martyr</a>. Their most important opponent was Father Edward Courtney (vere Leedes; cf. Gillow, "Bibl. Dict.", s.v. Leedes, Edward), who was therefore <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Charles. The matter is frequently mentioned in the dispatches and the "Relatione" of <a href="../cathen/11450b.htm">Panzani</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> agent to Queen Henrietta Maria (Maziere Brady, "Catholic Hierarchy", Rome, 1883, p. 88).

<h2 id="iii">Oath of abjuration under the commonwealth (1643)</h2>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> party had gained the upper hand during the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the exaction of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance fell into desuetude, and they were repealed by the Act of February, 1650, and their place taken by an "engagement of allegiance" to the Commonwealth. But the lot of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was not only not ameliorated thereby; it was made far worse by the enactment of an "Oath of Abjuration". This was passed 19 August, 1643, and afterwards, in 1656, reissued in an even more objectionable form. Everyone was to be "adjudged a Papist" who refused this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant's</a> goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right. Monstrous as the enactments were, their barbarity caused some shame among the more high-minded, and in practice they were sparingly enforced. They checked the gallicanizing party among the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which had at first been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of Allegiance, which is stated (Reusch, 335) to have been condemned anew about this time by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>. The chief writer on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side was the lawyer Austin, who generally used the pseudonym Birchley.

<h2 id="iv">The test oath (1672, 1678)</h2>

<p>(Also known as the D<font size=-2>ECLARATION OF</font> A<font size=-2>TTESTATION</font> O<font size=-2>ATH</font>.) The first Parliament after the Restoration revived the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, which were taken on 14 July, 1660. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> being at first in some favour at Court, managed, as a rule, to escape taking it. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the old controversy was revived through an address to the Crown, called "The Irish Remonstrance", which emphasized the principles of the condemned Oath of Allegiance. It had been drawn up by a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> (who afterwards left the order), called <a href="../cathen/15541a.htm">Peter Walsh</a> (Valesius), who published many books in its defence, which publications were eventually placed upon the Index. (Maziere Brady, "Catholic Hierarchy", Rome, 1888, p. 126) After the conversion of James, then Duke of York, the jealousy of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party increased, and in 1672 a Test Act was carried by Shaftesbury, which compelled all holders of office under the Crown to make a short "Declaration against <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>", viz., to swear that "there is not any <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, . . . at or after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> thereof by any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whatsoever" (25 Chas. II, c. 2). This test was effective: James resigned his post of Lord High Admiral. But when the country and the Parliament had gone mad over <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">Oates's plot</a>, 1678, a much longer and more insulting test was devised, which added a further clause that "The invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">virgin Mary</a>, or any <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> . . . are <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> . . . and that I make this declaration without any evasion, equivocation, or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation whatsoever, and without any <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> already granted me by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, &amp;c., &amp;c. (30 Chas. II, ii. 1). In modern times, the formula has become <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> (as we shall see) under the title of "the King's Declaration". At the time it was appointed for office holders and the members of both Houses, except the Duke of York. On the death of Charles, James II succeeded, and he would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have gladly abolished the anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> altogether. But he never had the opportunity of bringing the project before Parliament. Of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance we hear less in this reign, but the Test was the subject of constant discussion, for its form and scope had been expressly intended to hamper a reform such as James was instituting. He freed himself, however, more or less from it by the Dispensing Power, especially after the declaration of the judges, June, 1686, that it was contrary to the principles of the constitution to prevent the Crown from using the services of any of its subjects when they were needed. But the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a> quickly brought the Test back into greater vogue than ever. The first Parliament summoned after the triumph of William of Orange added a clause to the Bill of Rights, which was then passed, by which the Sovereign was himself to take the Declaration (1 W. &amp; M., sess. 1, c. 8). By this unworthy device no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could ever be admitted to accept the new regime, without renouncing his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This law marks the consummation of English anti-Catholic legislation.

<h2 id="v">The Irish oath of 1774 to emancipation, 1829</h2>

<p>For ninety years there seemed no hope of obtaining legislative relief from the pressure of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, and the first relaxations were due to external pressure. In 1770 General Burgoyne had proposed to free <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the Test, but in vain. In 1771, however, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to pacify <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and the Quebec Act was passed, the first measure of toleration for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> sanctioned by Parliament since the days of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary Tudor</a>. Soon after began the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of American Independence, the difficulties of which gradually awakened English statesmen to the need of reconciling <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Government took the first step by undoing William III's wicked work of joining the profession of fidelity to the sovereign with the rejection of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. In 1774 an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was proposed of allegiance to King George (&#167; 1) and rejection of the Pretender (&#167; 2), but without prejudice to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> spiritual authority, or to any <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Faith. The alleged malpractice of "no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>" was renounced (&#167; 3), so was the deposing power (&#167; 4), but without the objectionable words, impious, damnable and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>." The "temporal and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, direct and indirect within the realm" was also <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> (&#167; 5), and the promise was given that no <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> should be considered valid (&#167; 6). This <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Oath, of 1774, was accepted by the legislative authorities as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of loyalty, and it was freely taken, though several clauses were infelicitously worded, though no advantage accrued from so doing. In 1778 however, the first Relief Bill, also called Sir George Savile's Act, to relieve the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the worst consequences of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, came before the English Parliament, and in it was embodied the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Oath (18 George III, c. 60). This Act was passed with little difficulty, and the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was taken without remonstrance by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The relief given by the Bill of 1778 was so imperfect that further legislation was soon called for, and now the disadvantages of the system of tests were acutely felt. A committee of lay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with Gallican proclivities, who afterwards characteristically called themselves the Cisalpine Club were negotiating with the Government (see <a href="../cathen/03090b.htm">C<font size=-2>HARLES</font> B<font size=-2>UTLER</font></a>). To them it was represented that if more concessions were required more assurances should be given. They were accordingly presented with a long "Protest", which not only rejected the alleged malpractices, already disowned by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Oath, but declaimed against them and others of the same kind in strong but untheological language. It reintroduced, for instance, the objectionable terms "impious, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and damnable" of James's Oath of Allegiance. That complications might have ensued from signing such a document was not difficult to foresee. Nevertheless, the committee insisted (1) that words would be understood in a broad popular way, and (2) that, to obtain the Relief Act, it must be signed instantly. To prevent such a misfortune, it was freely signed by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and by the four <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, but two of these recalled their names. When, however, the signatures had been obtained, the new Relief Bill was brought forward by Government, with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> annexed founded on the Protest (hence called the "Protestation Oath"), which excluded from relief those who would not swear to it, and accept the name of "Protesting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Dissenters". A crisis had arisen for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; but with the crisis came the man. It was <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">John Milner</a>, then only a country <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to whose energy and address the dissipation of this danger was chiefly due. The Second Relief Act, therefore, passed (1791) without changing the previous <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, or the name of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Though the Emancipation Bill was eventually carried without any tests, this was not foreseen at first. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee continued its endeavours for disarming <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> prejudices, but their proposals (like the Veto) too often savoured of Gallicanism. So too did the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> annexed to the bill proposed in 1813, which from its length was styled the "Theological Oath". Eventually, owing to the growing influence exercised by Daniel O'Connell and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, Catholic Emancipation was fully, if tardily, granted without any tests at all in 1829.

<h2 id="vi">Repeal of the statutory oaths against Catholicity (1867-1910)</h2>

<p>The Relief Bills, hitherto mentioned, were generally measures of relief only, leaving the old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, and tests still upon the Statute Book, and some of the chief officers of State had still to take them. The actual repeal of the disused tests and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> of William III have only taken place in quite recent times. In 1867 the Declaration was repealed (30, 31 Vict., c. 75). After this, the only <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> bound to pronounce the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was the king himself at the commencement of his reign. In 1871 the Promissory Oaths Bill removed all the old Oaths of Allegiance (34, 35 Vict., c. 48). In 1891 the first attempt was made by Lord Herries in the House of Lords to get rid of the king's Declaration, but the amendments offered by Government were so insignificant that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> themselves voted against their being proposed at all. In 1901 strong resolutions were passed against its retention by the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> House of Commons, as also by its <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and these were emphasized by similar petitions from the hierarchies of Australia, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the English colonies. In 1904, 1905, and 1908 bills or motions to the same effect were introduced by Lord Braye, Lord Grey, Lord Llandaff, the Duke of Norfolk, and Mr. Redmond, but without the desired effect. After the death of King Edward VII, however, King George V is believed to have urged the Government to bring in a repealing Act. This was done and public opinion, after some wavering, finally declared itself strongly on the side of the Bill, which was carried through both Houses by large majorities, and received Royal Assent on 3 August, 1910, thus removing the last anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> or declaration from the English Constitution.
