<h1>Enguerrand de Monstrelet</h1>  

<p>A French chronicler, born about 1390 or 1395; died in July, 1453. He was most probably a native of Monstrelet, a village situated in the present department of the Somme. His life was spent at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> in the service of Philip, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who was also Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The cartulary of the church of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> proves that in 1436 Monstrelet was lieutenant of the <em>gavenier;</em> as such it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to collect in the Cambr&eacute;sis the tax called "gavenne", which was paid to Philip by the tenants of the churches there in return for the protection which he gave them. From 20 June, 1436, to January, 1440, he was bailiff (<em>bailli</em>) of the chapter of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> and he was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> (<em>pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t</em>) of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> from 1444 to 1446 (not until his death, as <a href="../cathen/04602a.htm">Dacier</a> says); he became bailiff of Walincourt on 12 March, 1445, an office which he held till his death. Monstrelet, who lived during an agitated period, did not take personal part in the conflicts of the day. To him, perhaps, applies a letter of pardon granted in 1424 to a certain Enguerrand de Monstrelet by Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who then ruled a part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>: Enguerrand, according to this letter, had committed certain highway robberies, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that he had a sufficient excuse because he robbed the Armagnacs, enemies of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. However this may be, his attitude in his "Chronicle" is that of an impartial narrator. He speaks of himself but once, when he relates in the eighty-sixth chapter of the second book that he was present at the interview which <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> before Compi&egrave;gne, had with Philip of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; and with his usual sincerity and modesty he declares that he does not remember well the words of the duke.

<p>The "Chronicle" of Monstrelet opens with a mention of the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles VI, which took place in 1380; but its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> starting-point is <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter-day</a>, 1400, when the history of <a href="../cathen/06308b.htm">Froissart</a> finishes, and it extends down to 1444. While <a href="../cathen/06308b.htm">Froissart</a> confined himself almost entirely to events which took place in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Monstrelet deals also with other countries, giving many documents. He treats not only of military history, but also gives interesting details of great religious events such as the Councils of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>, and Basle. We feel, moreover, that the ravages of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and the sufferings of the people therefrom cause him real pain, and he is not over-enthusiastic about great feats of arms. He is occasionally guilty of chronological <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and confusing proper names. Finally, the literary merit of the book is mediocre; the narrative is often heavy, monotonous, diffuse, and lacks the charm of <a href="../cathen/06308b.htm">Froissart</a>. In the early editions of Monstrelet &mdash; of which the first, published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> towards 1470 in three folio volumes, goes back almost to the invention of printing &mdash; the chronicles contain a third book, relating the events which took place between April, 1444, and the death of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> in 1467. But the "N&eacute;crologe des Cordeliersde Cambrai" and the "Memoriaux" of Jean le Robert prove that Monstrelet died in July, 1453, so that all this book could not possibly have been written by him. Furthermore, the history of years 1444-53. given in this third book, is so bald that it contrasts singularly with the prolixity of the first two books. It is, besides, much more partial to the House of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> than the first two, and, in contrast to these, scarcely contains a single document. Whereas the first two books are preceded by a preface, the third has none; finally, the historian, Matthieu d'Escouchy, in the prologue to his own chronicle, states that Monstrelet's "Chronicle" ends at 20 May, 1444. Modern scholars unanimously accept the statement of Matthieu d'Escouchy and hold that this so-called third book was not written by Monstrelet.
