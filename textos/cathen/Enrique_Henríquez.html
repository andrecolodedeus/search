<h1>Enrique Henr&iacute;quez</h1>  

<p>Noted <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, 1536; d. at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, 28 January, 1608. At the age of sixteen, in 1552, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and soon became celebrated for his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> erudition. He taught both these branches at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> and Salamanca; in the latter place he numbered Francisco Su&aacute;rez and <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a> among his pupils. In 1593 he left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, but soon returned to his former companions. Father Alcazar (Hist. Prov. Tolet., I, 204) gives the following account of this incident. After Henr&iacute;quez had printed in the preface of one of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works some passages not approved by the censors, Father Acquaviva ordered him to tear out the page containing these paragraphs. Henr&iacute;quez felt so disturbed over this punishment that he obtained permission from the holy father to leave the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and enter the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. It was <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a> who advised him to return to his former associates. Father Henr&iacute;quez is especially noted for two <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works: (1) The first part of his "Theologi&aelig; Moralis Summa" was published at Salamanca in 1591, the second in 1593; the work appeared again at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in 1597, and 1600; at Mentz, in 1613, under the title "Summa Theologi&aelig; Moralis libri XV" etc. It was forbidden by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 7 Aug., 1603, <em>donec corrigatur</em>, because the author allowed confession (but not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>) by way of letter, and held opinions too unfavorable to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the "Summa", Henr&iacute;quez treats only of the end of man, of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures and irregularities; but he manages to find an opportunity of declaring himself against Molina's <em>scientia media</em>; he defends the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> theory of physical predetermination, and of a <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> antecedent to the Divine foresight of our future merits. <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> highly esteems the authority of Henr&iacute;quez on moral questions, an opinion fully shared by Doujat in his "Pr&aelig;not. canon.", V. xv. (2) Henr&iacute;quez's second work is entitled "De pontificis romani clave, libri VI". It was published at Salamanca in 1593, but nearly all its copies were burnt by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> on account of its allowing the king too much power over <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. It is said that only three or four copies have been preserved among the rarities of the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. The subjects treated by Henr&iacute;quez in his second work are: the power and election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>; the authority of the councils; the question of law. The rarity of Father Henr&iacute;quez's second work is the reason why some biographers consider its treatises as part of his "Theolgi&aelig; Moralis Summa".
