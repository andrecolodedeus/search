<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Enthronization</h1>  

<p>(From Greek <em>&rsquo;enthron&#237;zein</em>, to place on a throne).

<p>This word has been employed in different meanings:

<p>(1) Formerly, it meant the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> placing of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> upon the altar of a church which was to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, hence a newly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> church was called <em>naos enthroniasmenos</em> (<em>na&#242;s &rsquo;enthroniasm&eacute;nos</em>).

<p>(2) In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> we find the <em>inthronizatio matrimonii</em>, or enthronization of marriage, which was nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10005a.htm">nuptial Mass</a> (<em>benedictio nuptiarum</em>).

<p>(3) In the East it was employed, but seldom, to denote the induction into a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>.

<p>(4) It was used especially to designate the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of enthronization which accompanies the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After receiving episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the newly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> conducted to the episcopal throne, of which he took possession. He received the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> and listened to the reading of a passage of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, whereupon he pronounced an address or <em>sermo inthronisticus</em>. The letters which it was customary for him to send to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in token of his being in communion with them in the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were called <em>litter&aelig; inthronistic&aelig;</em>, or <em>syllabai enthronistikai</em> (<em>sullaba&#236; &rsquo;enthronistika&#237;</em>), and the gifts which it was customary for him to present to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him, and to those who had taken part in the ceremonies were called the <em>inthronisticon</em> (<em>&rsquo;enthronistik&oacute;n</em>). At present, after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> has taken place, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is conducted by the consecrating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and one of the assistants to the throne occupied by the consecrator during the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, or to the seat usually taken by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> has taken place in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. The enthronization can also take place independently of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; in this case, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after taking his seat upon the throne, receives there the homage of all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> present in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. These ceremonies have no longer the slightest juridical importance (see <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>).

<p>(5) The enthronization of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03551e.htm">Chair of St. Peter</a>, <em>Cathedra Petri</em>, was formerly a very important <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, which took place at St. Peter's in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or, exceptionally, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter <em>ad Vincula</em>, where there was also a <em>Cathedra Petri.</em> This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was performed immediately after the election, if the latter had taken place in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, or before the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. Its object was to proclaim to the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> that the newly elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>. Before this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> had taken place, he was forbidden to take part in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1059 <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Pope Nicholas II</a> declared that the omission of the enthronization did not prevent the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from administering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> disappeared in the thirteenth century, owing to the fact that in that period the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> seldom resided in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Equivalent to enthronization is the <em>adoratio</em> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, which is performed in St. Peter's after the election of the pontiff. It is a simple <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> and does not confer the slightest <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>. 

<p>(6) The Roman <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">Pontifical</a> mentions enthronement amongst the ceremonies which accompany the solemn <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a king. It is still practised in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Episcopal Church</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">CORONATION</a>).
