<h1>Ephesus</h1>  

<p>A titular archiespiscopal see in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, said to have been founded in the eleventh century B.C. by Androcles, son of the Athenian King Codrus, with the aid of Ionian colonists. Its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> dates back to 700 B.C., the period when the first money was struck. After belonging successively to the kings of Lydia, the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, and the Syrian successors of Alexander the Great, it passed, after the battle of <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a> (199 B.C.), to the kings of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamum</a>, the last of whom, Attalus III, bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman people (133 B.C.). It was at Ephesus that Mithradates (88 B.C.) signed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> ordering all the Romans in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, in which massacre there perished 100,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Four years later Sulla, again master of the territory, slaughtered at Ephesus all the leaders of the rebellion. From 27 B.C. till a little after A.D. 297, Ephesus was the capital of the proconsular province of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, a direct dependency of the Roman Senate. Though unimportant politically, it was noted for its extensive commerce. Many illustrious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were born at Ephesus, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> Heraclitus and Hermodorus, the poet Hipponax, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Parrhasius (all in the sixth or fifth century B.C.), the geographer Artemidorus, another Artemidorus, <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a> and charlatan, both in the second century of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, and the historian and essayist, Xenophon. Ephesus owed its chief renown to its temple of Artemis (Diana), which attracted multitudes of visitors. Its first architect was the Cretan Chersiphron (seventh to sixth century B.C.) but it was afterwards enlarged. It was situated on the bank of the River Selinus and its precincts had the right of asylum. This building, which was looked upon in antiquity as one of the marvels of the world, was burnt by Herostratus (356 B.C.) the night of the birth of Alexander the Great, and was afterwards rebuilt, almost in the same proportions, by the architect Dinocrates. Its construction is said to have lasted 120 years, according to some historians 220. It was over 400 feet in length and 200 in breadth, and rested upon 128 pillars of about sixty feet in height. It was stripped of its riches by <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and was finally destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> (A.D. 262).

<p>It was through the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first introduced into Ephesus. The original community was under the leadership of Apollo (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>). They were disciples of St. John the Baptist, and were converted by Aquila and Priscilla. Then came <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who lived three years at Ephesus to establish and organize the new church; he was wont to teach in the schola or lecture-hall of the rhetorician Tyrannus (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs9">Acts 19:9</a>) and performed there many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Eventually he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to depart, in consequence of a sedition stirred up by the goldsmith Demetrius and other makers of ex-votoes for the temple of Diana (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs24">Acts 18:24 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs1">19:1 sqq.</a>). A little later, on his way to Jerusalem, he sent for the elders of the community of Ephesus to come to Miletus and bade them there a touching farewell (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs17">Acts 20:17-35</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ephesus was committed to his disciple, St. Timothy, a native of the city (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 1, 3</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs18">2 Timothy 1, 18</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs12">4:12</a>). The <a href="../bible/eph000.htm">Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians</a> was not perhaps addressed directly to them; it may be only a circular letter sent by him to several churches. The sojourn and death of the Apostle St. John at Ephesus are not mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but both are attested as early as the latter part of the second century by St. Iren&aelig;us (Adv. Haer., III, iii, 4), Polycrates, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ephesus (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.21</a>), <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, the "Acta Joannis", and a little earlier by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. Byzantine tradition has always shown at Ephesus the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostle. Another tradition, which may be trustworthy, though less ancient, makes Ephesus the scene of the death of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a>. On the other hand the opinion that the Blessed Virgin died there rests on no ancient testimony; the often quoted but ambiguous text of the Council of Ephesus (431), means only that there was at that time at Ephesus a church of the Virgin. (See Ramsay in "Expositor", June, 1905, also his "Seven Cities of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>".) We learn, moreover, from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.24</a>) that the three daughters of the Apostle St. Philip were buried at Ephesus.

<p>About 110 <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>, having been greeted at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> by messengers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ephesus, sent to it one of his seven famous epistles. During the first three centuries, Ephesus was, next to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, the chief centre of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. In the year 190 its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Polycrates, held a council to consider the paschal controversy and declared himself in favour of the Quartodeciman practice; nevertheless the Ephesian Church soon conformed in this particular to the practice of all the other Churches. It seems certain that the sixth canon of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325), confirmed for Ephesus its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over the whole "diocese" or civil territory of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, i.e. over the eleven ecclesiastical provinces; at all events, the second canon of the Council of Constantinople (381) formally recognized this authority. But Constantinople was already claiming the first rank among the Churches of the East and was trying to annex the Churches of Thrace, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. To resist these encroachments, Ephesus made common cause with Alexandria. We therefore find Bishop Memnon of Ephesus siding with St. Cyril at the Third Ecumenical Council, held at Ephesus in 431 in condemnation of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Stephen, supporting <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> at the so-called Robber Council (<em>Latrocinium Ephesinum</em>) of 449, which approved the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">heresy of Eutyches</a>. But the resistance of Ephesus was overcome at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), whose famous twenty-eighth canon placed the twenty-eight ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and Thrace under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Henceforth Ephesus was but the second <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, nor did it ever recover its former standing, despite a council of 474 in which Paul, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> restored its ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> influence was responsible for the hold which <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> gained at Ephesus during the sixth century; the famous <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, John of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, was then one of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Ephesus in those days ruled over thirty-six suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Justinian, who imitated Constantine in stripping the city of many works of art to adorn Constantinople, built there a magnificent church <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to St. John; this was soon a famous place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>.

<p>Ephesus was taken in 655 and 717 by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Later it became the capital of the theme of the Thracesians. During the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> period two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Ephesus suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Hypatius in 735 and Theophilus in the ninth century. In the same city the fierce general Lachanodracon <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Pelecete in Bithynia and other partisans of the <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a>. In 899 Leo the Wise transferred the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> to Constantinople. The city was captured in 1090 and destroyed by the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> succeeded in retaking it and rebuilt it on the neighbouring hills around the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John. Henceforth it was commonly called <em>Hagios Theologos</em> (the holy <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, i.e. St. John the Divine), or in <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <em>Aya Solouk</em> (to the Greeks the Apostle St. John is "the Theologian"); the French called the site <em>Altelot</em> and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> <em>Alto Luogo</em>. At the beginning of the thirteenth century its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Nicholas Mesarites, had an important role at the conferences between the Greeks and the Latins. The city was again plundered by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the first years of the fourteenth century, then by the Catalonian mercenaries in the pay of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, and once more by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John was transformed into a mosque, and the city was ruled by a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> ameer, who carried on a little trade with the West, but it could no longer maintain its Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A series of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from 1318 to 1411. The ruin of Ephesus was completed by Timur-Leng in 1403 and by nearly a half-century of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> among its <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> masters. When at the council of Florence in 1439 Mark of Ephesus (Marcus Eugenicus) showed himself so haughty toward the Latins, he was the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of a miserable village, all that remained of the great city which Pliny once called <em>alterum lumen Asiae</em>, or the second eye of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> (Hist. nat., V, xxix; also <a href="../bible/rev002.htm">Apocalypse 2:5</a>; cf. W. Brockhoff, "Ephesus vom vierten christlich. Jhdt. bis seinem Untergang", Jena, 1906).

<p>Today Aya Solouk has 3000 inhabitants, all Greeks. It is situated in the caza of Koush Adassi, in the vilayet of Aiden or Smyrna, about fifty miles from <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, on the Smyrna-Aidin railway. The ruins of Ephesus stand in the marshy and unhealthy plain below the village. There are the remains of the temple of Diana, the theatre, with a capacity of 25,000 spectators, the stadium, the great gymnasium, and the "Double Church", probably the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, one aisle of which was dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, the other to St. John, where the councils of 431 and 449 were held. The Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> resides at Manissa, the ancient Magnesia.
