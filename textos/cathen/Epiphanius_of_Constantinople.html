<h1>Epiphanius of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>Died 535. Epiphanius succeeded John II (518-20) as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. It was the time of the reaction against <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> in the Eastern Empire that followed the accession of Justin I (518-27). Justin was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; he let the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> (482) of his predecessor Zeno (474-91) quietly drop, and very soon after his accession he caused a synod of forty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to meet under John II at the capital, in order to proclaim a general acceptance of the decrees of Chalcedon throughout the empire, the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the deposition of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (P.G., LXXXVI, I, 785). The same synod reopened negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> after the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Acacius (484-519). The reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was Hormisdas (514-23), and it was on this occasion that he composed his famous formula. On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>, 24 March, 519, the reunion was proclaimed. Severus of Antioch and the other <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> leaders fled to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> remained at Constantinople till 520. In that year the Patriarch John died, and Epiphanius was elected as his successor. He was then given authority from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to reconcile all schismatics and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> who retracted their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and signed the formula. Epiphanius signed it himself in the first place (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VIII, 502 sqq.).

<p>Four letters from Epiphanius to Hormisdas are extant, with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters to him (P.L., LXIII). In the first, from Hormisdas to Epiphanius (col. 493), the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> complains that he has received as yet no letter and no <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to announce the patriarch's accession. In the second letter (l.c.) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> requires that three repentant <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Elias, Thomas, and Nicostratus, should be restored to their sees, and he appoints Epiphanius to restore them. Epiphanius then writes to Hormisdas (col. 494-95) to announce his succession to the See of Constantinople, as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had demanded. He excuses himself for his delay by explaining the difficult circumstances and the disorder that still remain since the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> troubles, and protests his exceeding desire for communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>: "It is my special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, most blessed Father, to be united to you and to embrace the Divine <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> which were left by the holy Apostles especially to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">holy See</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter, chief of the Apostles</a>; for I count nothing more precious than them" (l.c.). He then draws up a very <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> according to the decrees of Ephesus and Chalcedon; he accepts all the dogmatic letters of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a>, and declares that he will never name in his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> anyone who is condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His second letter (col. 497-99) to Hormisdas praises the emperor's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Faith, explains the case of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and the (civil) "diocese" of the East, whom Epiphanius wishes to receive back into communion now that they have renounced <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, and mentions a jewelled <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and other gifts he sends to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (this letter is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 520). Hormisdas answers (col. 505-6), exhorting the patriarch to persevere in reconciling <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and thanking him for his presents. Epiphanius' third letter relates that a number of Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have petitioned the emperor for union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (col. 506-7), and the fourth (col. 507) praises Paulinus, whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had sent to Constantinople as his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.G., LXXXVI, Pt. I, 783-86) gives the text of the condemnation of Severus and Peter of Antioch, made by a synod of Constantinople held under Epiphanius. Assemani (Bibl. Orient., I, 619) gives a list of forty-five canons drawn up by this same synod. Epiphanius was succeeded by Anthimus I.
