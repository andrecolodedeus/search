<h1>Epiphany</h1>  

<p>Known also under the following names: (1) <em>ta epiphania</em>, or <em>he epiphanios</em>, sc. <em>hemera</em> (rarely <em>he epiphaneia</em>: though, e.g. in <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <em>he somatike epiphaneia</em> occurs); <em>theophaneia</em>: <em>dies epiphaniarum; festivitas declarationis, manifestationis; apparitio; acceptio</em>. (2) <em>hemera ton photon</em>: <em>dies luminum; dies lavacri</em>. (3) <em>phagiphania</em>, <em>Bethphania</em>; etc. (4) <em>Festum trium regum</em>: whence the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <em>Drie-koningendag</em> <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <em>Hellig-tre-kongersdag</em>, etc. (5) Twelfth Day, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <em>Trettondedag</em>;, etc. &#151; The meaning of these names will be explained below. The feast was called among the Syrians <em>denho</em> (up-going), a name to be connected with the notion of rising light expressed in Luke. I, 78. The name <em>Epiphania</em> survives in Befana, the great fair held at that season in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it is difficult to say how closely the practice then observed of buying all sorts of earthenware images, combined with whistles, and representing some type of Roman life, is to be connected with the rather similar custom in vogue during the December feast of the Saturnalia. For the earthenware or pastry <em>sigillaria</em> then sold all over <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, see Macrobius; s. I, x, xxiv; II, xlix; and Brand, "Pop. Ant.", 180, 183.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>As its name suggests, the Epiphany had its origin in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. There exists indeed a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> to which (in one <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> only) is affixed the lemma i<em>eis ta hagia theophaneia</em> [not <em>epiphaneia</em>: Kellner]; it is throughout addressed to one about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and deals only with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. It was edited by Bonwetsch and Achelis (Leipzig, 1897); Achelis and others consider it spurious. The first reference about which we can feel certain is in Clement (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.21.45</a>), who writes: "There are those, too, who over-curiously assign to the Birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a> not only its year but its day, which they say to be on 25 Pachon (20 May) in the twenty-eighth year of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. But the followers of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> celebrate the day of His Baptism too, spending the previous night in readings. And they say that it was the 15th of the month Tybi of the 15th year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius Caesar</a>. And some say that it was observed the 11th of the same month." Now, 11 and 15 Tybi are 6 and 10 January, respectively. The question at once arises; did these <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a> celebrate <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christ's Nativity</a> and also His Baptism on 6 and 10 January, or did they merely keep His Baptism on these days, as well as His Nativity on another date? The evidence, if not Clement's actual words, suggests the former. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Epiphany festival in the East very early admitted a more or less marked commemoration of the Nativity, or at least of the <em>Angeli ad Pastores</em>, the most striking "manifestation" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> glory on that occasion. Moreover, the first actual reference to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> feast of the Epiphany (Ammianus Marcellinus, XXI, ii), in 361, appears to be doubled in <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> (XIII, xi) by a reference to the same festival as that of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christ's Nativity</a>. Moreover, Epiphanius (Haer., li, 27, in P.G., XLI, 936) says that the sixth of January is <em>hemera genethlion toutestin epiphanion</em>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Birthday, i.e. His Epiphany. Indeed, he assigns the Baptism to 12 Athyr, i.e. 6 November. Again in chapters xxviii and xxix (P.G., XLI, 940 sq.) he asserts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Birth, i.e. Theophany, occurred on 6 January, as did the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> at Cana, in consequence of which water, in various places (Cibyra, for instance), was then yearly by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> turned into wine, of which he had himself drunk. It will be noticed, first, if Clement does not expressly deny that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrated the Epiphany in his time at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, he at least implies that she did not. Still less can we think that 6 January was then observed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as holy. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, in his list of festivals (<a href="../fathers/04168.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VIII.22</a>), makes no mention of it.

<p>Owing no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to the vagueness of the name <em>Epiphany</em>, very different manifestations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> glory and Divinity were celebrated in this feast quite early in its history, especially the Baptism, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> at Cana, the Nativity, and the visit of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. But we cannot for a moment suppose that in the first instance a festival of manifestations in general was established, into which popular local devotion read specified meaning as circumstances dictated. It seems fairly clear hat the Baptism was the event predominantly commemorated. The Apostolic Constitutions (VIII, xxxiii; cf. V, xii) mention it. Kellner quotes (cf. Selden, de Synedriis, III, xv, 204, 220) the oldest Coptic Calendar for the name <em>Dies baptismi sanctificati</em>, and the later for that of <em>Immersio Domini</em> as applied to this feast. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> identifies, indeed, <em>ta theophania</em> with <em>he hagia tou Christou gennesis</em>, but this sermon (Orat. xxxviii in P.G., XXXVI. 312) was probably preached 25 Dec., 380; and after referring to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Birth, he assures his hearers (P.G., 329) that they shall shortly see Christ <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. On 6 and 7 Jan., he preached orations xxxix and xl (P.G., loc. cit.) and there declared (col. 349) that the Birth of Christ and the leading of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> by a star having been already celebrated, the commemoration of His Baptism would now take place. The first of these two sermons is headed <em>eis ta hagia phota</em>, referring to the lights carried on that day to symbolize the spiritual illumination of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the day must carefully be distinguished from the Feast of the Purification, also called <em>Festum luminum</em> for a wholly different reason. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, however, in 386 (see <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">CHRISTMAS</a>) preached "Hom. vi in B: Philogonium" where (P.G., XLVIII, 752) he calls the Nativity the parent of festivals, for, had not Christ been born, neither would He have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <em>hoper esti ta theophania</em>. This shows how loosely this title was used. (Cf. Chrys., "Hom. in Bapt. Chr.", c. ii, in P.G., XLIX, 363; A.D. 387). Cassian (Coll., X, 2, in P.L., XLIX; 820) says that even in his time (418-427) the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> still celebrated the Nativity and Baptism on 6 January.



<p>At <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the feast had a special reference to the Nativity owing to the neighbourhood of Bethlehem. The account left to us by Etheria (Silvia) is mutilated at the beginning. The title of the subsequent feast, <em>Quadragesimae de Epiphania</em> (Perigrin. Silviae, ed. Geyer, c.xxvi), leaves us, however, in no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to what she is describing. On the vigil of the feast (5 Jan.) a procession left <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for Bethlehem and returned the following morning. At the second hour the services were held in the splendidly decorated Golgotha church, after which that of the Anastasis was visited. On the second and third days this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was repeated; on the fourth the service was offered on Mount Olivet; on the fifth at the grave of Lazarus at Bethany; on the sixth on Sion; on the seventh in the church of the Anastasia, on the eighth in that of the Holy Cross. The procession to Bethlehem was nightly repeated. It will be seen, accordingly, that this Epiphany octave had throughout so strong a Nativity colouring as to lead to the exclusion of the commemoration of the Baptism in the year 385 at any rate. It is, however, by way of actual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on this day that the West seems to enter into connection with the East. St. Chrysostom (Hom. in Bapt. Chr. in P.G., XLIX, 363) tells us how the Antiochians used to take home <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the night of the festival, and that it remained for a year without corruption. To this day, the blessing of the waters by the dipping into river, sea, or lake of a crucifix, and by other complicated ritual, is a most popular <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. A vivid account is quoted by Neale ("Holy Eastern Church", Introduction, p. 754; cf. the Greek, Syriac, Coptic, and Russian versions, edited or translated from the original texts by <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">John, Marquess of Bute</a>, and A. Wallis Budge). The people consider that all ailments, spiritual and physical, can be cured by the application of the blessed water. The custom would seem, however, to be originally connected rather with the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of Cana than with the Baptism. That <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on this day was quite usual in the West is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, however, by the complaint of Bishop Himerius of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> to Pope Damasus (d. 384), that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> were being celebrated on the feast of the Epiphany. <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a>, who answered him (P.L., XIII, 1134) identifies the feasts of <em>Natalitia Christi</em> and of his <em>Apparitio</em>, and is very indignant at the extension of the period for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> beyond that of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and that of Pentecost. <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> ("Ep. xvi ad Sicil. episcopos", c. i, in P.L., LIV, 701; cf. 696) denounces the practice as an <em>irrationabilis novitas</em>; yet the Council of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> (can. iv) condemned it in 517, and Victor Vitensis alludes to it as the regular practice of the (Roman-) African Church (De Persec. Vandal., II, xvii, in P.L., LVIII, 216). <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, moreover (De glori&acirc; martyrum in P.L., LXXI, 783; cf. cc. xvii, xix), relates that those who lived near the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> bathed in it that day, and that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were then wont to take place. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Comm. in Ez., I, i, on verse 3 in P.L., XXV, 18) definitely asserts that it is for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and opening of the heavens that the <em>dies Epiphaniorum</em> is still venerable and not for the Nativity of Christ in the flesh, for then <em>absconditus est, et non apparuit</em> &#151; "He was hidden, and did not appear."

<p>That the Epiphany was of later introduction in the West than the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> festival of 25 December, has been made clear in the article <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">CHRISTMAS</a>. It is not contained in the Philocalian Calendar, while it seems most likely that 25 December was celebrated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the sermon of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> (in <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, De virg., iii, I, in P.L., XVI, 231) which many assign to 25 Dec., 354. St. Augustine clearly observes Oriental associations in the Epiphany feasts: "Rightly", says he (Serm. ccii, 2, in Epiph. Domini, 4, in P, L., XXXVIII, 1033), "have refused to celebrate this day with us; for neither do they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unity, nor are they in communion with the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, where at last the star appeared." <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">St. Philastrius</a> (Haer., c. cxl, in P.L., XII, 1273) adds that certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> refuse to celebrate the Epiphany, regarding it, apparently, as a needless duplication of the Nativity feast, though, adds the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, it was only after twelve days that Christ "appeared to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> in the Temple". The <em>dies epiphaniorum</em>, he says (P.L., XII, 1274), is by some thought to be "the day of the Baptism, or of the Transformation which occurred on the mountain". Finally, an unknown Syrian annotator of Barsalibi (Assemani, Bibl. Orient., II, 163) boldly writes: "The Lord was born in the month of January on the same day on which we celebrate the Epiphany; for of old the feasts of the Nativity and Epiphany were kept on one and the same day, because on the same day He was born and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The reason why our fathers changed the solemnity celebrated on 6 January, and transferred it to 25 December follows: it was the custom of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> to celebrate the birthday of the sun on this very day, 25 December, and on it they lit lights on account of the feast. In these solemnities and festivities the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> too participated. When, therefore, the teachers observed that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were inclined to this festival, they took counsel and decided that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth-feast be kept on this day, and on 6 Jan., the feast of the Epiphanies. Simultaneously, therefore, with this appointment the custom prevailed of burning lights until the sixth day."

<p>It is simpler to say that, about the time of the diffusion of the December celebration in the East, the West took up the Oriental January feast, retaining all its chief characteristics, though attaching overwhelming importance, as time went on, to the apparition of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. Epiphanius indeed had said (loc. cit.) that not only did water in many places turn into wine on 6 Jan., but that whole rivers, and probably the Nile, experienced a similar <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; nothing of this sort is noted in the West. The Leonine Sacramentary is defective here; but Leo's eight <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the <em>Theophania</em> (in P.L., LIV, Serm. xxxi, col. 234, to Serm. xxxviii, col. 263) bear almost wholly on the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, while in Serm. xxxv, col. 249, he definitely asserts their visit to be the commemoration for which the feast was instituted. Fulgentius (Serm. iv in P.L., LXV, 732) speaks only of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a>. Augustine's sermons (cxcix-cciv in P.L., XXXVIII) deal almost exclusively with this manifestation; and the Gelasian Sacramentary (P.L., LXXIV, 1062) exclusively, both on the vigil and the feast. The Gregorian Sacramentary makes great use of <a href="../bible/psa072.htm#vrs10">Psalm 72:10</a> and mentions the three great apparitions in the Canon only. The Ambrosian, however, refers to all three manifestations in the vigil-preface, and in the feast-preface to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> alone. The "Missale Vesontiense" (Neale and Forbes, The Anc. Liturgies of the Gallican Church, p. 228) speaks, in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, of <em>Illuminatio, Manifestatio, Declaratio,</em> and compares its Gospel of <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs13">Matthew 3:13-17</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs22">Luke 3:22</a>; and <a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs1">John 2:1-11</a>, where the Baptism and Cana are dwelt upon. The <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> are referred to on the Circumcision. The Gothic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Neale and Forbes, op. cit., p. 52) mentions the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> on the vigil, saying that the Nativity, Baptism, and Cana make <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <em>Illustratio</em>. All the manifestations are, however, referred to, including (casually) the feeding of the 5000, a popular allusion in the East, whence the name <em>phagiphania</em>. Augustine (Serm. suppl. cxxxvi, 1, in P.L., XXXIX, 2013) speaks of the raising of Lazarus (cf. day 5 of the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> ritual) as on an equality with the other manifestations, whence in the East the name <em>Bethphania</em> occurs. <a href="../cathen/10081a.htm">Maximus of Turin</a> admits the day to be of three <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and speculates (Hom. vii, in epiph., in P.L., LVII, 273) on the historical connection of date and events. Polemius Silvanus, <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus of Nola</a> (Poem. xxvii; Natal., v, 47, in P.L., LXI) and Sedulius (in P.L., LXXII) all insist on the three manifestations. The Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> refers mainly to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, using of their welcome by Christ the word <em>Acceptio</em>, a term of "initiation" common to <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithraists</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 381, the Council of Sargossa (can. iv), read together with the Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal's</a> Mass <em>in jejunio epiphaniae</em>, makes it clear that a fast at this season was not uncommon even among the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. "Cod. Theod." (II, viii, 20; XXV, v, 2) forbids the circus on this day in the year 400; "Cod. Justi." (III, xii, 6) makes it a day of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. In 380 it is already marked by cessation of legal business in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; in Thrace (if we can trust the "Passio S. Philippi" in Ruinart, "Acta", 440, 2) it was kept as early as 304. Kellner quotes the "Testamentum Jesu Christi" (Mainz, 1899) as citing it twice (I, 28; IV, 67, 101) as a high festival together with <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost.

<p>In the present Office, <em>Crudelis Herodes</em> alludes to the three manifestations; in <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> i, the first response for the day, the octave, and the Sunday within the octave, deals with the Baptism, as does the second response; the third response, as all those of <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a> i and iii, is on the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. The antiphon to the Benedictus runs: "Today the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is joined to her celestial spouse, because in Jordan Christ doth wash her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> hasten with gifts to the royal marriage-feast, and the guests exult in the water turned to wine." <em>O Sola</em> refers to the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> only. The Magnificat antiphon of Second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> reads: "We keep our Holy Day adored with three <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: today a star led the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> to the crib, today wine was made from water at the marriage, today in Jordan Christ willed to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John to save us." On the Epiphany it was a very general custom to announce the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and even of other festivals, a practice ordered by many councils, e.g. that of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 541 (can. i); Auxerre in 578 and 585 (can. ii), and still observed (Kellner) at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, etc. Gelasius finally tells us (Ep. ad episc. Lucan., c. xii, in P.L., LIX, 52) that the dedication of virgins occurred especially on that day.

<p>The reason for the fixing of this date it is impossible to discover. The only tolerable solution is that of Mgr. Duchesne (Orig. Chr., 262), who explains simultaneously the celebration of 6 January and of 25 December by a backward reckoning from 6 April and 25 March respectively. The Pepyzitae, or Phrygian <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, says <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (<a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.18</a>), kept <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on 6 April; hence (reckoning an exact number of years to the Divine life) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birthday would have fallen on 6 January. But, it may be urged, the first notice we have of the observance of this date, refers to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Baptism. But this (if we may assume the <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a>, too, to have argued from 6 April) will have fallen on the exact anniversary of the Birth. But why preeminently celebrate the Baptism? Can it be that the celebration started with those, of whatever <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, who held that at the Baptism the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> descended upon Christ? On this uncertain territory we had better risk no footstep till fresh evidence, if such there be, be furnished us. Nor is this the place to discuss the legends of the Three Kings, which will be found in the article <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">MAGI</a>.
