<h1>Episcopal Gloves</h1>  

<p>Liturgical gloves (<em>chirothec&oelig;</em>, called also at an earlier date <em>manic&oelig;</em>, <em>wanti</em>,) are a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> adornment reserved for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, including <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, cannot use them without a special <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privilege. They are worn only at a <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>, never at any other function, and then only to the washing of the hands before the Sacrifice. Episcopal gloves at the present day are knitted by machine or hand from silk thread, and are ornamented on the back with a cross; the border of the opening for the hand is also, as a rule, embellished. The colour of the gloves must correspond with the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colour of the feast or day in the services of which they are worn; episcopal gloves, however, are never black, as they are not used on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> nor at the celebration of Masses for the dead. When a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the gloves are put on him by the consecrator, aided by the assisting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, just after the Blessing. The use of episcopal gloves became customary at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> probably in the tenth century, outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they were employed somewhat earlier. Apparently they were first used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as the earliest traces of the custom are found in this country, whence it gradually spread into all other parts and even to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The chief reason for the introduction of the usage was probably the desire to provide a suitable adornment for the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, rather than practical considerations such as the preservation of the cleanliness of the hands, etc. Episcopal gloves appertained originally to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> their use was also granted to other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, thus no later than 1070 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Pietro in Cielo d'Oro at Pavia received this privilege, the first certain instance of such permission.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> these gloves were either knitted or otherwise produced with the needle, or else they were made of woven material sewed together; the former way seems to have been the more usual. Gloves made by both methods are still in existence, as for example, in Saint-Sernin at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, at Brignoles, in S. Trinit&agrave; at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of Halberstadt and Brixen, in New College at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Conflens in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and other places. In the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it became customary to enlarge the lower end, giving it the appearance of a cuff or gauntlet, and even to form the cuff with a long joint which hung downwards and was decorated with a tassel or little bell. The back of the glove was always ornamented, sometimes with an <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> medallion or some other form of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, sometimes with a metal disk having on it a representation of the Lamb of God, a cross, the Right Hand of God, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, etc., the disk being sewn on to the glove, or, at times, the ornamentation was of pearls and precious stones. The gloves were generally made of silk thread or woven fabric, rarely of woollen thread, sometimes of linen woven material. Up to the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the usual colour was white, although the gloves at New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, are red; apparently it was not until the sixteenth century that the ordinances as to <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours were applied to episcopal gloves. Even in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the occasions on which the gloves were worn were not many, but their use was not so limited as today, for in the earlier period they were occasionally worn at the <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> after Communion, at solemn offices, and during processions. Episcopal gloves are symbolical of purity from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the performance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, and carefulness of procedure.
