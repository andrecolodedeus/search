<h1>Episcopal Intercession</h1>  

<p>The right to intercede for criminals, which was granted by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Early Church. This right originated rather in the great respect in which the episcopal dignity was held in the early centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, than in any definite enactment. Reference to its existence is made in the seventh canon of the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> about 344 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Collectio Amplissima Conciliorum", III. It is also mentioned by St. Augustine (Epp. cxxxiii and cxxxix, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XXXIII, 509, 535), <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. lii, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XXII, 527-40), and by <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> in his "Church History" (V, xiv; VII, xvii). St. Augustine repeatedly interceded for criminals with Macedonius, who was then governor of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> (Epp. clii-cliii, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XXXIII, 652). <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">Martin of Tours</a> interceded with Emperor Maximus for the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Priscillianists in 384-5: and Bishop Flavian of Antioch interceded with <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius I</a> in 387 on behalf of the inhabitants of Antioch, who had wantonly destroyed the imperial <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in that city. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> induced <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius I</a> to enact a law which forbade the execution of the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> and the confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> until thirty days after sentence had been passed. It was the purpose of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to leave room for clemency and to prevent the punishing of the innocent [see <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, "Gallia Orthodoxa" pars I, lib. II, cap. v, in "&OElig;uvres Compl&egrave;tes", XII (Bar-le-Duc, 1870), 98]. To enable them to exercise their right of intercession, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had free access to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> (Codex Theodosii, app., cap. xiii). They were even exhorted to visit the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> every Wednesday and Saturday in order to investigate the cause of their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and to admonish the supervisors of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> to treat those committed to their charge with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian charity</a>. In case the prison-keepers were found to be inhuman or remiss in their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to report these abuses to the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which were almost unlimited in this respect, were somewhat regulated for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Eastern Empire in "Codex Justiniani", lib. I, tit. 4: "De episcopali audientia"; for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Western Empire in the "Edicta Theoderici", cap. xiv (Mon. Germ. Leg., V). Closely allied with the right of episcopal intercession was the right of asylum or sanctuary (see RIGHT OF ASYLUM), and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to protect <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and other unfortunates. Thus Theodoret, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cyrus, interceded with Empress Pulcheria in behalf of the poor of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, who were overladen with taxes; the Third <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, held in 399, requested the emperor to accede to the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by appointing advocates to plead the causes of the poor before the courts, while the Council of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, held in 585, forbade all <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> to begin judicial proceedings against <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> without previously notifying the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to which the accused belonged.
