<h1>Episcopal Subsidies</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>subsidia</em>, tribute, pecuniary aid, subvention)

<p>Since the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contribute to the support of religion, especially in their own diocese, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may ask contributions for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> needs from his own subjects, and particularly from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. These offerings as far as possible should be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, rather than taxes or assessments strictly so called. Of the contributions given to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, some are ordinary, made annually or at stated times; others are extraordinary, given as special circumstances demand. Under ordinary subsidies are classed the <em>cathedraticum</em>, a fixed sum given annually to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from the income of the churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and which in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> constitutes the chief revenue of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <em>census</em>, or pensions, which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may impose at times in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; hospitality or procuration (<em>procuratio</em>, <em>comestio</em>, <em>circada</em>, <em>albergaria</em>) extended to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his assistants canonically visiting the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; contributions (<em>seminaristicum</em>, <em>alumnaticum</em>) for the support of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, or for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students; fees of the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chancery office</a> (<em>jus sigilli:</em> see <a href="../cathen/14467b.htm">TAXA INNOCENTIANA</a>). In regard to the maintenance of students for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> an annual collection is made of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> offerings of the people; in others an assessment is imposed on each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Chancery fees go to meet the expenses of the office; the surplus, if any, is employed in charitable works, and not for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> personally. Formerly there too was a share falling to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from legacies, bequests, etc. (<em>quarta mortuaria</em>, <em>quarta funerum</em>, <em>quarta episcopalis</em>, <em>portio canonica</em>), and likewise a portion of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> (<em>quarta decimarum</em>, <em>quarta decimatio</em>), which accrued to the churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>The chief extraordinary tax, which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may levy, is a charitable subsidy (<em>subsidium caritativum</em>). This may be asked from all churches and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, secular or regular not exempt, and from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> possessing <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, but not from <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a>. The following conditions must be observed. There must be a reasonable and evident cause for the subsidy, as, for example, to meet the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> expenses of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, his visit <em>ad limina</em>, attendance at a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, prosecuting the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, or for the general good of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; this extraordinary tax, however, is permissible only when other means are wanting (S. C. C., 17 Feb., 1663); the exaction, though varying according to the need in question, must be moderate, the amount being determined chiefly by custom; the advice of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter or the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors must be obtained; the poor are not to be taxed. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it is only when taking formal possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is free to exact this tribute (Taxa Innocentiana, 8 Oct. 1678); on other occasions the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is required. Although the subvention is asked in the name of charity, it is binding, and delinquents may be compelled by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> punishments to meet this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Such a tax, if imposed for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is called <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's pence</a>. Patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> are not allowed such tribute from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of their suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Abbots and religious superiors, through privilege or custom, may exact a similar subsidy from their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or communities for the evident good of their orders. The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (n. 20) declares that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having consulted his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> advisers, must have recourse to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, if a new tax is to be imposed for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> beyond what is allowed in <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>.
