<h1>Episcopal and Pontifical Capitulations</h1>  

<p>Capitulations were agreements, by which those taking part in the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> imposed special conditions upon the candidate to be fulfilled by him after his election. Episcopal capitulations owe their origin to the fact that since the eleventh and twelfth centuries the real election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was restricted to the canons of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, who were anxious to curtail the prerogatives or the income of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to secure for themselves privileges or larger revenues. Since the early part of the thirteenth century the canons of Mains agreed amongst themselves not to elect a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> unless he promised beforehand to exact no financial contributions from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Such capitulations became practically universal throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remained in the hands of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters. In the diet held at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in 1522 the chapters were condemned for extorting such concessions from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. If these capitulations contain conditions which curtail the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, or the like, then they do not bind the candidate-elect, even if he has taken an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to carry them out; the canons have no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in such matters. Several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> declarations forbade them and pronounced them invalid; thus the Constitution "Contingit" of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (1277-80) in the "Liber Sextus" (II, tit., xi, 1); <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1566-72) "Durum nimis", 31 May, 1570; <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (1572-85) "Inter apostolicas", 5 September, 1584; <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> (1691-1700) "Ecclesi&aelig; Catholic&aelig;", 22 September, 1695; and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-58) "Pastoralis regiminis", 15 July, 1754. Severe penalties were imposed on those who should act contrary to these instructions, viz., suspension for those in the episcopal order, <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> for the chapters, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for their individual members. Still the capitulations were maintained in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, partly because the constitution of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> states was often based on them; partly because such privileges of the chapters were acknowledged by the "Instrumentum pacis", or Treaty of Osnabr&uuml;ck (1648); and partly because the emperors at the beginning of their reigns promised to protect the customary usages of the chapters.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> capitulations arose in about the same manner when, from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the election of a pope was reserved to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The first authentic example occurred when <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> (1352-62) was chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The conditions then laid down by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> restricted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, especially with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, punishment, or deposition of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the appointment to positions in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> provinces, and the administration of temporalities &mdash; in all of which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> wished to have a voice. Similar but more far-reaching capitulations were entered into at the election of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (1431-47), at the election of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> (1458-64), at the election of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> (1464-71), and at the election of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> (1484-92). These <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> capitulations were likewise forbidden and pronounced null and void. <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, in the Constitution "Sollicitudo" of the year 1353, rejected as not binding upon him the capitulation entered into at the time of his own election. <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> believed that he was not bound to observe those conditions of the capitulation which were contrary to the prerogatives of the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. More general declarations are contained in the Constitution "Ubi periculum" of <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1271-76), published in 1274; in the "In eligendis", published by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (1559-65), 9 October, 1562; and in the "&AElig;terni Patris" of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (1621-23), 15 November, 1621.
