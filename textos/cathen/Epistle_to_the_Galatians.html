<h1>Epistle to the Galatians</h1>  

<h2>Galatia</h2>

<p>In the course of centuries, gallic tribes, related to those that invaded <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and sacked <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, wandered east through Illyricum and Pannonia. At length they penetrated through <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> (279 B.C.), and assembled in great numbers under a prince entitled Brennus, for the purpose of invading Greece and plundering the rich temple of Delphi. The leaders disagreed and the host soon divided, one portion, under Brennus, marching south on Delphi: the other division, under Leonorius and Luterius, turned eastward and overran Thrace, the country round Byzantium. Shortly afterwards they were joined by the small remnants of the army of Brennus, who was repulsed by the Greeks, and killed himself in despair. In 278 B.C., 20,000 Gauls, under Leonorius, Luterius, and fifteen other chieftains, crossed over to <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, in two divisions. On reuniting they assisted Nicomedes I, King of Bithynia, to defeat his younger brother; and as a reward for their services he gave them a large tract of country, in the heart of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, henceforward to be known as Galatia.

<p>The Galatians consisted of three tribes: <ul> <li>the Tolistboboii, on the west, with Pessinus as their chief town; <li>the Tectosages, in the centre, with their capital Ancyra; and <li>the Trocmi, on the east, round their chief town Tavium.</ul> Each tribal territory was divided into four cantons or tetrarchies. Each of the twelve tetrarchs had under him a judge and a general. A council of the nation consisting of the tetrarchs and three hundred senators was periodically held at a place called Drynemeton, twenty miles southwest of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>.

<p>That these people were Gauls (and not Germans as has sometimes been suggested) is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the testimony of Greek and Latin writers, by their retention of the Gallic language till the fifth century, and by their personal and place names. A tribe in the west of Gaul in the time of Caesar (Bell. Gall., VI, xxiv) was called Tectosages. In Tolistoboii we have the root of the word <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and in Boii the well known Gallic tribe. Brennus probably meant prince; and Strabo says he was called Prausus, which in Celtic means terrible. Luterius is the same as the Celtic Lucterius, and there was a British saint called Leonorius. Other names of chieftains are of undoubted Gallic origin, e.g. Belgius, Achichorius, Gaezatio-Diastus. Brogoris (same root as Brogitarus, Allobroges), Bitovitus, Eposognatus (compare Caesar's Boduognatus, etc.), Combolomarus (Caesar has Virdomarus, Indutionmarus), Adiorix, Albiorix, Ateporix (like Caresar's Dumnorix, ambiorix, Vercingetorix), Brogitarus, Deiotarus, etc. Place names are of a similar character, e.g. Drynemeton, the "temple of the oaks" or The Temple, from <em>nemed</em>, "temple" (compare Augustonemetum in Auvergene, and Vernemeton, "the great temple", near <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>), Eccobriga, Rosologiacum, Teutobodiacum, etc. (For a detailed discussion of the question see Lightfoot's "Galatians", dissertation i, 4th ed., London, 1874, 235.)

<p>As soon as these Gauls, or Galatians, had gained a firm footing in the country assigned to them, they began to send out marauding expeditions in all directions. They became the terror of their neighbours, and levied contributions on the whole of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> west of the Taurus. They fought with varying success against Antiochus, King of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who was called Soter from his having saved his country from them. At length Attlaus I, King of Pergamun, a friend of the Romans, drove them back and confined them to Galatia about 235-232 B.C. After this many of them became mercenary soldiers; and in the great battle of <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, 180 B.C., a body of such Galatian troops fought against the Romans, on the side of Antiochus the Great, King of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. He was utterly defeated by the Romans, under Scipio Asiaticus, and lost 50,000 of his men. Next year the Consul Manlius entered Galatia, and defeated the Galatians in two battles graphically described by Livy, XXXVIII, xvi. These events are referred to in I Mach., viii. On account of ill-treatment received at the hands of Mithradates I King of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, the Galatians took the side of Pompey in the Mitradatic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> (64 B.C.). As a reward for their services, Deiotarus, their chief tetrarch, received the title of king, and his dominions were greatly extended. Henceword the Galatians were under the protection of the Romans, and were involved in all the troubles of the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that followed. They supported Pompey against Julius Caesar at the battle of Pharsalia (48 B.C.). Amyntas, their last king was set up by Mark Antony, 39 B.C. His kingdom finally included not only Galatia Proper but also the great plains to the south, together with parts of Lyesonia, Pamphylia, <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>, and Phrygia, i.e. the country containing the towns Antioch, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> and <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>. Amyntas went to Actium, 31 B.C., to support Mark Antony; but like many others he went over, at the critical moment, to the side of Octavianus, afterwards called <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> confirmed him in his kingdom, which he retained until he was slain in ambush, 25 B.C. After the death of Amyntas, <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> made this kingdom into the Roman province of Galatia, so that this province had been in existence more than 75 years when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote to the Galatians.
<h2>The North and the South Galatian theories</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> addresses his letter to the churches of Galatia (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs2">Galatians 1:2</a>) and calls them Galatians (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs1">Galatians 3:1</a>); and in <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 6:1</a>, he speaks of the collections which he ordered to be made in the churches of Galatia. But there are two theories as to the meaning of these terms. It is the opinion of Lipsius, Lightfoot, Davidson, Chase, Findlay, etc., that the Epistle was addressed to the people of Galatia Proper, situated in the centre of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, towards the north (North Galatian Theory). Others, such as Renan, Perrot, Weizsacker, Hausrath, Zahn, Pfleiderer, Gifford, Rendell, Holtzmann, Clemen, Ramsay, <a href="../cathen/04378a.htm">Cornely</a>, Page, Knowling, etc., hold that it was addressed to the southern portion of the Roman province of Galatia, containing <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Pisidian Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>, and Derbe, which were visited by Saints Paul and Barnabas, during their first missionary journey (South Galatian Theory).

<p>Lightfoot was the chief upholder of the North-Galatian theory; but a great deal has become known about the geography of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> since he wrote in the eighteenth century, and the South-Galatian Theory has proportionately gained ground. A German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> professor, Stinmann (Der Liserkreis des Galaterbriefes), has, however, recently (1908) given Lightfoot his strong support, though it must be admitted that he has done little more than emphasize and expand the arguments of Chase. The great coryphaeus of the South-Galatian theory is Prof. Sire W.M. Ramsay. The following is a brief summary of the principal arguments on both sides.

<p>(1) The fact that the Galatians were being changed so soon to another gospel is taken by Lightfoot as evidence of the characteristic fickleness of the Gauls. Ramsay replies that tenacity in matters of religion has ever been characteristic of the Celts. Besides, it is precarious to argue from the political mobility of the Gauls, in the time of Caesar, to the religious inconsistency of Galatians, whose ancestors left the West four hundred years before. The Galatians received <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs14">Galatians 4:14</a>). Lightfoot sees in this enthusiastic reception <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Celtic fickleness of character. In the same way it may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the 5000 converted by St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and, in fact, that, nearly all the converts of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> were Celts. Acts (xiii-xiv) gives sufficient indications of fickleness in South Galatia. To take but one instance: at <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> the multitude could scarcely be restrained from sacrificing to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; shortly afterwards they stoned him and left him for dead.


<p>(2) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> warns the Galatians not to abuse their liberty from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, by following the works of the flesh. He then gives a long catalogue of vices. From this Lightfoot selects two (<em>methai, komoi</em>) as evidently pointing to Celtic failings. Against this it may be urged that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, writing to the Romans (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm">13:13</a>), exhorts them to avoid these two very vices. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, in giving such an enumeration here and elsewhere, evidently does not intend to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the peculiar failings of any race, but simply to reprobate the works of the flesh, of the carnal or lower man; "they who do such things shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs21">Galatians 5:21</a>).

<p>(3) <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">Witchcraft</a> is also mentioned in this list. The extravagant devotion of Deiotarus, says Lightfoot, "fully bears out the character ascribed to the parent race." But the <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Emperor Tiberius</a> and many officials in the empire were ardent devotees of augury. Sorcery is coupled by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and it was its habitual ally not only amongst the Gauls but throughout the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world.

<p>(4) Lightfoot says that the Galatians were drawn to Jewish observances; and he takes this as evidence of the innate Celtic propensity to external ceremonial, "appealing rather to the senses and passions than the heart and mind." This so-called racial characteristic may be questioned, and it is a well-known fact that the whole of the aboriginal inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> were given over heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to gross <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> ceremonial. We do not gather from the Epistle that the Galatians were naturally attracted to Jewish ceremonies. They were only puzzled or rather dazed (iii, 1) by the specious arguments of the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, who endeavoured to persuade them that they were not as perfect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as if they adopted <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>.

<p>(5) On the South-Galatian theory it is supposed that the Epistle was written soon after <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> second visit to <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, etc. (<a href="../bible/act016.htm">Acts 16</a>). Lightfoot makes use of a strong argument against this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. He shows, by a detailed examination, that the Epistle bears a close resemblance, both in argument and language, to parts of the Epistle to the Romans. This he thinks can be accounted for only on the supposition that both were written about the same time, and, therefore, several years later than the date required for the South-Galatian view. To this date required for the South-Galatian view. To this Rendell (Expositor's Greek Test., London, 1903.p. 144) replies that the coincidence is not due to any similarity in the circumstances of the two communities. "Still less can the identity of language be fairly urged to prove an approximation of the two epistles. For these fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> formed without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the staple of the Apostle's teaching throughout the years of continuous transition from Jewish to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, and his language in regard to them could not fail to become in some measure stereotyped."

<p>(6) The controversy has raged most fiercely round the two verses in <a href="../bible/act016.htm">Acts 16:6</a> and <a href="../bible/act018.htm">18:23</a>, the only places where there is any reference to Galatia in Acts: <ul><li>"And they went through the Phrygian and Galatian region" (<em>ten phrygian kai Galatiken choran</em>); <li>"he departed and went through the Galatian region and Phrygia" (or "Phrygian") (<em>ten Galatiken choran kai phyrgian</em>).</ul> Lightfoot held that Galatia Proper was meant in the second. Other supporters of the North-Galatian theory think that the countries of North Galatia and Phrygia are meant in both cases. Their opponents, relying on the expression of contemporary writers, maintain that South Galatia was intended in both places. The former also interpret the second part of xvi, 6 (Greek text) as meaning that the travellers went through Phrygia and Galatia after they had passed through South Galatia, because they were forbidden to preach in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Ramsey, on the other hand, maintains that after they had passed through the portion of Phrygia which had been added to the southern part of the province of Galatia (and which could be called indifferently Galatian or Phrygian) they passed to the north because they were forbidden to preach in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. He holds that the order of the verbs in the passage is in the order of time, and he gives examples of similar use of the aorist participle (St. Paul The Traveller, London, 1900, pp. ix, 211, 212).

<p>The arguments on both sides are too technical to be given in a short article. The reader may be referred to the following: North-Galatian: Chase, "Expositor", Dec. 1893. p. 401, May, 1894, p. 331; Steinmann, "Der Leserkreis des Galaterbriefes" (M&uuml;nster, 1908), p. 191. On the South-Galatian side: Ramsey, "Expositor", Jan., 1894, p. 42, Feb., p. 137, Apr., p. 288, "St. Paul The Traveller", etc; Knowling, "Acts of the Apostles", Additional note to ch. xviii (Expositor's Greek Test., London, 1900, p. 399); Gifford, "Expositor", July, 1894, p. I.

<p>(7) The Galatian churches were evidently important ones. On the North-Galatian theory, St. Luke dismissed their conversion in a single sentence: "They went through the Phrygian and Galatian region" (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs6">Acts 16:6</a>). This is strange, as his plan throughout is to give an account of the establishment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in each new region. Lightfoot fully admits the force of this, but tries to evade it by asking the question: "Can it be that the historian gladly drew a veil over the infancy of a church which swerved so soon and so widely from the purity of the Gospel?" But the subsequent failings of the Corinthians did not prevent St. Luke from giving an account of their conversion. Besides, the Galatians had not swerved so widely from the purity of the Gospel. The arguments of the judaizers made some of them waver, but they had not accepted <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; and this Epistle confirmed them in the Faith, so that a few years later <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> writes of them to the Corinthians (<a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>): "Now concerning the collections that are made for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also." It was long after the time that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> could thus confidently command the Galatians that Acts was written.

<p>(8) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> makes no mention of this collection in our Epistle. According to the North-Galatian theory, the Epistle was written several years before the collection was made. In <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs4">Acts 20:4</a>, etc., a list is given of those who carried the collections to Jerusalem. There are representatives from South Galatia, <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; but there is no deputy from North Galatia &#151; from the towns of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on occasion, the majority probably meeting at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, St. Luke, and Sopater of Berea (probably representing Philippi and <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>; see <a href="../bible/2co008.htm#vrs18">2 Corinthians 8:18-22</a>); Aristarchus and Secundus of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>; Gaius of <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, and Timothyof Lystra (S. Galatia); and Tychicus and Trophimus of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. There is not a word about anybody from North Galatia, the most probable reason being that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> had never been there (see Rendall, Expositor, 1893, vol. II, p. 321).

<p>(9) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the Roman citizen, invariably employs the names of the Roman provinces, such as <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; and it is not probable that he departed from this practice in his use of "Galatia". The people of South Galatia could with propriety be styled Galatians. Two of the towns, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and Lystra, were Roman colonies; and the other two boasted of the Roman names, Claudio-Iconium, and Claudio-Derbe. "Galatians" was an honourable title when applied to them; but they would be insulted if they were called Phrygians or Lycaonians. All admit that St. Peter named the Roman provinces when he wrote "to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> strangers dispersed throughout <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, <em>Galatia</em>, Cappadocia, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and Bithynia" (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs1">1 Peter 1:1</a>).

<p>(10) The manner in which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> mentions St. Barnabas in the Epistle indicates that the latter was known to those for whom the Epistle was primarily intended. St. Barnabas had visited South Galatia with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs14">Acts 13:14</a>), but he was unknown in North Galatia.

<p>(11) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> states (ii, 5) that the reason for his course of action at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel <em>might continue</em> with the Galatians. This seems to imply that they were already converted. He had visited the southern part of the Galatian province before the council, but not northern. The view favoured above receives confirmation from a consideration, as appended, of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> addressed.
<h2>The kind of people addressed</h2>

<p>The country of South Galatia answers the conditions of the Epistle admirably; but this cannot be said of North Galatia. From the Epistle we gather that the majority were <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts, that many were probably Jewish <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> from their acquaintance with the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them from the first were living amongst them; that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> had visited them twice, and that the few Judaziers appeared amongst them only after his last visit. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../bible/act003.htm">Acts 3</a> and <a href="../bible/act014.htm">14</a> (and early history), that <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were settled in South Galatia. During the first missionary journey unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> made their presence felt everywhere. As soon as Paul and Barnabas returned to Syrian Antioch, some Jewish converts came from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and taught that the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them, and went up to the council, where it was decreed that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a> were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; but nothing was determined as to the attitude of Jewish converts regarding them, following the example of St. James, though it was implied in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that they were matters of indifference. This was shown, soon after, by St. Peter's eating with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. On his withdrawing from them, and when many others followed his example, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> publicly vindicated the equality of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The majority agreed; but there must have been "false brethren" amongst them (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs4">Galatians 2:4</a>) who were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only in name, and who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Some of these, in all probability, followed him to South Galatia, soon after his second visit. But they could no longer teach the necessity of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, as the Apostolic decrees had been already delivered there by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs4">Acts 16:4</a>). These decrees are not mentioned in the Epistle by the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, the advisability of the Galatians accepting <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, for their <em>greater perfection.</em> On the other hand, there is no evidence that there were any <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> settled at this time in North Galatia (see Ramsay, "St. Paul The Traveller"). It was not the kind of country to attract them. The Gauls were a dominant class, living in castles, and leading a half pastoral, half nomadic life, and speaking their own Gallic language. The country was very sparsely populated by the subjugated agricultural inhabitants. During the long winter the ground was covered with snow; in summer the heat was intense and the ground parched; and one might travel many miles without meeting a human being. There was some fertile tracts; but the greater part was either poor pasture land, or barren undulating hilly ground. The bulk of the inhabitants in the few towns were not Gauls. Trade was small, and that mainly in wool. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was supposed to be framed for those at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, in Galatia. It is now known that it was addressed to quite a different region.
<h2>Why written</h2>

<p>The Epistle was written to conteract the influence of a few <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> who had come amongst the Galatians, and were endeavouring to persuade them that in order to be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm"><em>perfect</em> Christians</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>. Their arguments were sufficiently specious to puzzle the Galatians, and their object was likely to gain the approval of unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They said what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> taught was good as far as it went; but that he had not taught the full perfection of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. And this was not surprising, as he was not one of the great Apostles who had been taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and received their commission from Him. Whatever <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he learned from others, and he had received his commission to preach not from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but from men at Antioch (<a href="../bible/act013.htm">Acts 13</a>). Circumcision and the Law, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but they were essential to the full perfection of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. This was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the example of St. James, of the other Apostles, and of the first disciples, at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. On this very point this Paul, the Apostle, placed himself in direct opposition to Cephas, the Prince of the Apostles, at Antioch. His own action in <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcising</a> Timothy showed what he expected of a personal companion, and he was now probably teaching the good of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> in other places. These statements puzzles the Galatians, and made them waver. They felt aggrieved that he had left them, as they thought, in an inferior position; they began to observe Jewish festivals, but they had not yet accepted <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. The Apostle refutes these arguments so effectively that the question never again arose. Henceforth his enemies confined themselves to personal attacks (see II Corinthians).
<h2>Contents of the epistle</h2>

<p>The six chapters naturally fall into three divisions, consisting of two chapters each. <ul> <li>In the first two chapters, after the general introduction, he shows that he is an Apostle not from men, nor through the teaching of any man, but from Christ; and the gospel he taught is in harmony with the teaching of the great Apostles, who gave him the right hand of fellowship. <li>He next (iii, iv) shows the inefficacy of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the Law, and that we owe our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> to Christ alone. He appeals to the experience of the Galatian converts, and brings forward <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from Scripture. <li>He exhorts them (v, vi) not to abuse their freedom from the Law to indulge in crimes, "for they who do such things shall not obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." It is not for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of them he admonishes, that the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> wish the Galatians to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. If there is virtue in the mere cutting of the flesh, the inference from the argument is that the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> could become still more perfect by making themselves eunuchs &#151; mutilating themselves like the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Cybele. He writes the epilogue in large letters with his own hand. </ul>
<h2>Importance of the epistle</h2>

<p>As it is admitted on all hands that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote the Epistle, and as its authenticity has never been seriously called in question, it is important not only for its biographical data and direct teaching, but also for the teaching implies in it as being known at the time. He claims, at least indirectly, to have worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> amongst the Galatians, and that they received the Holy Ghost (iii, 5), almost in the words of St. Luke as to the events at <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a> (<a href="../bible/act014.htm#vrs3">Acts 14:3</a>). It is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>; but is is the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as it is of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is of any avail is "faith that worketh by charity" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs6">Galatians 5:6</a>); and he states most emphatically that a good life is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for, after enumeration the works of the flesh, he writes (v, 21), "Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." In vi, 8, he writes: "For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh, also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting." The same teaching is found in others of his Epistles, and is in perfect agreement with St. James: "For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without works is dead" (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs2">James 2:2</a>). The Epistle implies that the Galatians were well acquainted with the doctrines of the Trinity, the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Incarnation, Redemption, Baptism, Grace, etc. As he had never to defend his teaching to these points against <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a>, and as the Epistle is so early, it is clear that his teaching was identical with that of the Twelve, and did not, even in appearance, lend itself to attack.
<h2>Date of the epistle</h2>

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> asserted that it was the first of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. Prof. Sir W. Ramsay (Expositor, Aug., 1895, etc.) and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> professor, Dr. Valentin Weber (see below), maintain that it was written from Antioch, before the council (A.D. 49-50). Weber's arguments are very plausible, but not quite convincing. There is a good summary of them in a review by Gayford, "Journal of Theological Studies", July, 1902. The two visits to Galatia are the double journey to Derbe and back. This solution is offered to obviate apparent discrepancies between <a href="../bible/gal002.htm">Galatians 2</a> and <a href="../bible/act015.htm">Acts 15</a>.

<p>(2) Cornel and the majority of the upholders of the South-Galatian theory suppose, with much greater probability, that it was written about A.D. 53, 54.

<p>(3) Those who defend the North-Galatian theory place it as late as A.D. 57 or 58.
<h2>Difficulties of Galatians 1 and 2</h2>

<p>(a) "I went up . . . and communicated to them the gospel . . . lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain." This does not imply any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his teaching, but he wanted to neutralize the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> by proving he was at one one with the others.

<p>(b) The following have the appearance of being ironical: "I communicated . . . to them who seemed to be some thing" (ii, 2); But of them who seemed to be something . . . for to me they that seemed to be something added to nothing" (ii, 6): "But contrawise . . . James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars." Here we have three expressions <em>tois dokousin</em> in verse 2; <em>ton dokounton einai ti</em>, and <em>oi dokountes</em> in verse 6; and <em>oi dokountes styloi einai</em> in verse 9. Non-Catholic scholars agree with St. John Chrystostom that there is nothing ironical in the original context. As the verbs are in the present tense, the translations should be: "those who are in repute"; "who are (rightly) regarded as pillars". It is better to understand, with Rendall, that two classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are meant: first, the leading men at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; secondly, the three apostles. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> argument was to show that his teaching had the approval of the great men. St. James is mentioned first because the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizers</a> made the greatest use of his name and example. "But of them who are in repute (what they were some time, it is nothing to me. God accepteth not the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>)", verse 6. St. Augustine is almost alone in his interpretation that it made no matter to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> that the Apostles were once poor <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men. Others hold that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> was referring to the privilege of being personal disciples of our Lord. He said that did not alter the fact of his Apostolate, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not regard the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of men. Most probably this verse does not refer to the Apostles at all; and Cornerly supposes that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is speaking of the elevated position held by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> at the council, and insists that it did not derogate from his Apostolate.

<p>(c) <em>"I withstood Cephas."</em> &#151; "But when Cephas was come to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, I withstood him to the face, because he was <em>blamed</em> [<em>kategnosmenos</em>, perf. part. &#151; not, "to be blamed", as in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>]. For before that some came from James, he did eat with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; but when they were done, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. And to his dissimulation the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: if thou, being a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, livest after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and not as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do, how dost thou compel the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to live as do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?" (ii, 11-14).

<p>Here St. Peter was found fault with probably by the Greek converts. He did not withdraw on account of bodily fear, says St. John Chrystostom; but as his special mission was at this time to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he was afraid of shocking them who were still weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. His usual manner of acting, to which he was led by his vision many years previously, shows that his exceptional withdrawal was not due to any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. He had motives like those which induced <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcise</a> Timothy, etc.; and there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that in acting upon them he committed the slightest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Those who came from James probably came for no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose; nor does it follow they were sent by him. The Apostles in their letter (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs24">Acts 15:24</a>) say: "Forasmuch as we have heard, that some going out from us have troubled you . . . to whom we gave no commandment." We need not suppose that St. Peter foresaw the effect of his example. The whole thing must have taken some time. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> did not at first object. It was only when he saw the result that he spoke. The silence of St. Peter shows that he must have agreed with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; and, indeed, the argument to the Galatians required that this was the case. St. Peter's exalted position is indicated by the manner in which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says (i, 18) that he went to behold Peter, as people go to view some remarkable sight; and by the fact that in spite of the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and Barnabas for a long time at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, his mere withdrawal was sufficient to draw all after him, and in a manner compel the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. In the expression "when I saw that they walked not uprightly", they does not necessarily include St. Peter. The incident is not mentioned in the Acts, as it was only transitory. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250101.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.12</a>) says that <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a>, in the fifth book of the <em>Hypotyposeis</em> (Outlines), asserts that this Cephas was not the Apostle, but one of the seventy disciples. Clement here has few followers.

<p>A very spirited controversy was carried on between <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and St. Augustine about the interpretation of this passage. In his "Commentary on the Galatians", <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, following earlier writers such as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, supposed that the matter was arranged beforehand between St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. They agreed that St. Peter should withdraw and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> should publicly reprehend him, for the instruction of all. Hence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says that he withstood him in appearance (<em>kata prosopon</em>). Otherwise, says <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, with what face could <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who became all things to all men, who became a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> that he might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy, who shaved his head, and was ready to offer sacrifice at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, blame St. Peter for acting in a similar manner? St. Augustine, laying stress on the words "when I saw that they walked not uprightly", etc., maintained that such an interpretation would be subversive of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. But against this it may be said that it is not so very clear that St. Peter was included in this sentence. The whole controversy can be read in the first volume of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> edition of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works, Epp., lvi, lxvii, civ, cv, cxii, cxv, cxvi.

<p>(d) <em>Apparent Discrepancies between the Epistle and Acts.</em> &#151; (1) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says that three years after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (after having visited Arabia and returned to Damascus) he went up to Jerusalem (i, 17, 18) Acts states that after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> "he was with the disciples that were at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, for some days" (ix, 19). "He immediately began to preach in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>" (ix, 20). "He increased more in strength, and confounded the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>" (ix, 22). "And when many days were passed, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> consulted together to kill him" (ix, 23); he then escaped and went to Jerusalem. These accounts here are not contradictory, as has been sometimes objected; but were written from different points of view and for different purposes. The time for the visit to Arabia may be placed between <a href="../bible/act009.htm">Acts 9:22 and 23</a>; or between "some days" and "many days". St. Luke's "many days" (<em>hemerai ikanai</em>) may mean as much as three years. (See <a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#vrs38">1 Kings 2:38</a>; so Paley, Lightfoot, Knowling, Lewin.) The adjective <em>ikanos</em> is a favourite one with St. Luke, and is used by him with great elasticity, but generally in the sense of largeness, e.g. "a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>: and a <em>great</em> multitude of the city" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs12">Luke 7:12</a>); "there met him a certain man who <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">had a devil</a> now a very long time" (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs27">Luke 8:27</a>); "a herd of many swine feeding" (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs32">Luke 8:32</a>); "and he was abroad for a long time" (<a href="../bible/luk020.htm#vrs9">Luke 20:9</a>); "for a long time, he had bewitched them" (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs11">Acts 8:11</a>). See also <a href="../bible/act014.htm#vrs3">Acts 14:3, 21</a> (Greek text); <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs18">18:18</a>, <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs19">19:19, 26</a>; <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs37">20:37</a>.

<p>(2) We read in <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs27">Acts 9:27</a>, that St. Barnabas took <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> "to the apostles". <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> states (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs19">Galatians 1:19</a>) that on this occasion, besides St. Peter, "other of the apostles I saw one, saving James the brother of the Lord". Those who find a contradiction here are hard to satisfy. St. Luke employs the word <em>Apostles</em> sometimes in a broader, sometimes in a narrower sense. Here it meant the Apostles who happened to be at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Peter and James), or the assembly over which they presided. The objection can be pressed with any force only against those who deny that St. James was an Apostle in any of the senses used by St. Luke (see <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">BRETHREN OF THE LORD</a>).
