<h1>Epistles of Saint Peter</h1>  

<p>These two epistles will be treated under the following heads: I. Authenticity; II. Recipients, occasion, and object; III. Date and place of composition; IV. Analysis.
<h2>First epistle</h2>
<h3 id="A">Authenticity</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a>, universally admitted by the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has been denied within the past century by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalist</a> critics (Baur and the T&uuml;bingen School, Von Soden, Harnack, J&uuml;licher, Hilgenfeld, and others), but it cannot seriously be questioned. It is well established by extrinsic and instrinsic arguments.

<p><em>(1) Extrinsic arguments</em>

<p>(a) in writings of the first and second centuries, e.g., <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin's</a> letter to the Churches of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Vienne, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, Papias, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a>, the "Didache", the "Pastor" of Hermas, and others. The Second Epistle of St. Peter, admitted to be very ancient even by those who question its authenticity, alludes to an earlier Epistle written by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> (iii, 1). The letter therefore existed very early and was considered very authoritative. (b) Tradition is also unanimous for St. Peter's authorship. In the second and third centuries we have much explicit testimony to this effect. Clement and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the Peshitto in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, the ancient Itala and <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> all agree in attributing it to Peter, as do also the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Theodore of Byzantium. (c) All the collections or lists of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> mention it as St. Peter's; the Muratorian Canon, which alone is at variance with this common tradition, is obscure and bears evident marks of textual corruption, and the subsequent restoration suggested by Zahn, which seems much more probable, is clearly favourable to the authenticity. Moreover <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> does not hesitate to place it among the undisputed Scriptures.

<p><em>(2) Intrinsic arguments</em>

<p>Examination of the Epistle in itself is wholly favourable to its authenticity; the author calls himself Peter, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (i, 1); Mark, who, according to the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, had such close relations with Peter, is called by the author "my son" (v, 13); the author is represented as the immediate disciple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (i, 1; v, 9, 11-14); he exercises from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the whole Church (v, 1). The numerous places in which he would appear to be the immediate witness of the life of Christ (i, 8; ii, 21-24; v, 1), as well as the similarity between his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the teaching of the Gospels, are eloquently in favour of the Apostolic author (cf. Jacquier, 251). Finally, some authors consider that the Epistle and the sermons of St. Peter related in the Acts show an analogy in basis and form which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> a common origin. However, it is probable if not certain that the Apostle made use of an interpreter, especially of Sylvanus; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says: "the two Epistles attributed to St. Peter differ in style, character, and the construction of the words, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that according to the exigencies of the moment St. Peter made use of different interpreters" (Ep. cxx ad Hedib.). Peter himself seems to insinuate this: <em>Dia Silouanou houmin . . . egrapha</em> (v, 12), and the final verses (12-14) seem to have been added by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> himself. Without denying that Peter was able to use and speak Greek, some authors consider that he could not write it in the almost classic manner of this Epistle. Nevertheless it is impossible to determine exactly the share of Sylvanus; it is not improbable that he wrote it according to the directions of the Apostle, inserting the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and exhortations suggested by him.

<p>Objections: (a) The relation between the First Epistle of Peter and the Epistles of Paul, especially Romans and Ephesians, does not prove, as has been claimed (J&uuml;licher), that the Epistle was written by a disciple of Paul. This relation, which has been much exaggerated by some critics, does not prove a literary dependence nor prevent this Epistle from possessing a characteristic originality in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and form. The resemblance is readily explained if we admit that Peter employed Sylvanus as interpreter, for the latter had been a companion of Paul, and would consequently have felt the influence of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and manner of speaking. Moreover, Peter and Sylvanus were at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the letter was written, and they would naturally have become acquainted with the Epistles to the Romans and the Ephesians, written some months before and intended, at least in part, for the same readers. (b) It has been claimed that the Epistle presupposes an official and general <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the Roman Empire and betokens a state of things corresponding to the reign of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, or even that of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> or <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, but the data it gives are too indefinite to conclude that it refers to one of these persecutions rather than to that of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>; besides, some authors consider that the Epistle does not at all suppose an official <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the allusions being readily explained by the countless difficulties and annoyances to which <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> subjected the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.
<h3 id="B">Recipients of the epistle; occasion and object</h3>

<p>It was written to the faithful of "Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia" (i, 1). Were these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, dispersed among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (i, 1), as was held by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/04784a.htm">Didymus of Alexandria</a>, etc., and is still maintained by Weiss and Kuhl, or were they in great part of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> origin? The latter is by far the more common and the better opinion (i, 14; ii, 9-10; iii, 6; iv, 3). The argument based on i, 7, proves nothing, while the words "to the strangers dispersed through <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>" should not be taken in the literal sense of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in exile, but in the metaphorical sense of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, living in exile on earth, far from their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> country. The opinions of authors admitting the authenticity are divided with regard to the historical circumstances which occasioned the Epistle, some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that it was written immediately after <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> proscribing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, in which case the difficulties to which Peter alludes do not consist merely of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and vexations of the people, but also include the judicial pursuit and condemnation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (iv, 14-16; v, 12; ii, 23; iii, 18), while iv, 12, may be an allusion to the burning of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which was the occasion of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. This is the opinion of <a href="../cathen/07515a.htm">Hug</a>, Gloire, Batiffol, Neander, Grimm, Ewald, Allard, Weiss, Callewaert, etc., while others date the Epistle from the eve of that <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (Jacquier, Brassac, Fillion, etc.). The Epistle, they say, having been written from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> must have raged in all its horror, we naturally look for clear and indisputable indications of it, but the general theme of the epistle is that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should give no occasion to the charges of the infidels, but that by their exemplary life they should induce them to glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (ii, 12, 15; iii, 9, 16; iv, 4); besides, the way of speaking is generally hypothetical (i, 6; iii, 13-14; iv, 14), there being no question of judges, tribunals, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, tortures, or confiscation. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have to suffer, not from authority, but from the people among whom they lived.


<p>The Apostle Peter wrote to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> to confirm them in the Faith, to console them amid their tribulations, and to indicate to them the line of conduct to follow in suffering (v, 2). Except for the more dogmatic introduction (i, 3-12) and a few short instructions strewn throughout the letter and intended to support moral exhortations, the Epistle is hortatory and practical. Only an absurd a priori argument could permit the T&uuml;bingen critics to assert that it had a dogmatic object and was written by a second-century <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> with the intention of attributing to Peter the doctrines of Paul.
<h3 id="C">Place and date of composition</h3>

<p>The critics who have denied Peter's sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> must necessarily deny that the letter was written from there, but the great majority of critics, with all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, agree that it was written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, designated by the metaphorical name Babylon (v, 13). This interpretation has been accepted from the most remote times, and indeed no other metaphor could so well describe the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, rich and luxurious as it was, and given over to the worship of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods and every species of immorality. Both cities had caused trouble to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Babylon to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Moreover this metaphor was in use among the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/rev014.htm#vrs8">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="../bible/rev016.htm#vrs19">16:19</a>; <a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs5">17:5</a>; <a href="../bible/rev018.htm#vrs2">18:2, 10, 21</a>). Finally, tradition has not brought us the faintest memory of any sojourn of Peter at Babylon. The opinions of critics who deny the authenticity of the Epistle range from A.D. 80 to A.D. 160 as the date, but as there is not the slightest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of its authenticity they have no basis for their argument. Equally diverse opinions are found among the authors who admit the authenticity, ranging from the year A.D. 45 to that accepted as that of the death of Peter. The most probable opinion is that which places it about the end of the year 63 or the beginning of 64; and St. Peter having suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 64 (67?) the Epistle could not be subsequent to that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; besides, it assumes that the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, which began about the end of 64, had not yet broken out (see above). On the other hand the author frequently alludes to the Epistle to the Ephesians, making use of its very words and expressions; consequently the Epistle could not be prior to 63, since the Epistle to the Ephesians was written at the end of Paul's first captivity at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (61-63).
<h3 id="D">Analysis</h3>

<p>The Epistle as a whole being but a succession of general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> without close connection, there can be not strict plan of analysis. It is divided as follows: the introduction contains, besides the address (superscription and salutation, i, 7), thanksgiving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and regeneration to which He has deigned to call the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (3-12). This part is dogmatic and serves as a basis for all the moral exhortations in the body of the Epistle. The body of the Epistle may be divided into three section: (a) exhortation to a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life (i, 13-ii, 10), wherein Peter successively exhorts his readers to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in general (13-21), to fraternal charity in particular (i, 22-ii, 1), to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and desire of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; thus they shall be living stones in the spiritual house of which Christ is the cornerstone, they shall be the royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the chosen people of the Lord (2-10). (b) Rules of conduct for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> living among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, especially in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (ii, 11-v, 19). Let their conduct be such that the infidels themselves shall be edified and cease to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (11-12). This general principle is applied in detail in the exhortations relating to obedience to civil rulers (13-17), the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of slaves to their masters (18-25), the mutual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of husband and wife (iii, 1-7). With regard to those who, not having the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> and persecute the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the latter should return good for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, according to the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who though innocent suffered for us, and who preached the Gospel not only to the living, but also to the spirits that were in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (8-22). The Apostle concludes by repeating his exhortation to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in general (iv, 1-6), to charity (7-11), to patience and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in suffering for Christ (12-19). (c) Some special recommendations follow (v, 1-11): let the ancients be careful to feed the flock entrusted to their keeping (1-4); let the faithful be subject to their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> (5a); let all observe <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> among themselves (5b); let them be sober and watchful, trusting the Lord (6-11).

<p>In the epilogue the Apostle himself declares that he has employed Sylvanus to write the letter and affirms that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> possessed by his readers is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> grace (12); he addresses to them the salutations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and those of Mark (13), and gives them his <a href="../cathen/02602a.htm">Apostolic blessing</a>.
<h2>Second epistle</h2>
<h3 id="A">Authenticity</h3>

<p>In the present state of the controversy over the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> it may be affirmed that it is solidly probable, though it is difficult to prove with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p><em>(1) Extrinsic arguments</em>

<p>(a) In the first two centuries there is not in the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, if we except <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a> (180), a single quotation properly so called from this Epistle; at most there are some more or less probable allusions in their writings, e.g., the First Epistle of St. Clement of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the Corinthians, the "Didache", St. Ignatius, the Epistle of Barnabas, the "Pastor" of Hermas, the Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, the Dialogue of St. Justin with Trypho, St. Iren&aelig;us, the Clementine "Recognitions", the "Acts of Peter", etc. The Epistle formed part of the ancient Itala, but is not in the Syriac. This proves that the Second Epistle of Peter existed and even had a certain amount of authority. But it is impossible to bring forward with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> a single explicit testimony in favour of this authenticity. The Muratorian Canon presents a mutilated text of I Peter, and Zahin's suggested restoration, which seems very probable, leaves only a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> with regard to the authenticity of the Second Epistle.

<p>(b) In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> there is not explicit testimony in favour of the canonicity and Apostolicity of this Epistle until the middle of the fourth century. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> do not mention it, and Mommsen's Canon (360) still bears traces of the uncertainty among the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Churches of the West</a> in this respect. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> gave earlier testimony in its behalf. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and Photius, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (d. 215) commented on it, but he seems not to have ranked it with the first. It is found in the two great <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> versions (Sahidic and Bohairic). It is probable that Firmilian of Caesarea used it and ascribed it to St. Peter, as <a href="../cathen/10243a.htm">Methodius of Olympus</a> did explicitly. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> (340), while personally accepting II Peter as authentic and canonical, nevertheless classes it among the disputed works (<em>antilegomena</em>), at the same time affirming that it was known by most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and studied by a large number with the other Scriptures. In the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> at that period it was regarded as of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> does not speak of it, and it is omitted by the Peshitto. That the Epistle formerly accepted in that Church (Theophilus of Antiocy) was not yet included in the canon was probably due to dogmatic reasons.

<p>(c) In the second half of the fourth century these <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> rapidly disappeared in the Churches of the East owing to the authority of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> and the fifty copies of the Scriptures distributed by command of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>. <a href="../cathen/04784a.htm">Didymus of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, the Canon of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, all regard the letter as authentic. The addition to the text of Didymus, according to which it was the work of a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a>, seems to be the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a copyist. So in the West relations with the East and the authority of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> finally brought about the admission of its authenticity. It was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and the synod convoked by Pope Damasus in 382 expressly attributes it to St. Peter.

<p><em>(2) Intrinsic arguments</em>

<p>If tradition does not appear to furnish an apodictic argument in favour of the authenticity, an examination of the Epistle itself does. The author calls himself Simon Peter, servant and Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (i, 1), witness of the glorious transfiguration of Christ (i, 16-18); he recalls the prediction of His death which Christ made to him (i, 14); he calls the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> his brother, i.e., his colleague in the Apostolate (iii, 15); and he identifies himself with the author of the First Epistle. Therefore the author must necessarily be St. Peter himself or some one who wrote under his name, but nothing in the Epistle forces us to believe the latter. On the other hand there are several indications of its authenticity: the author shows himself to be a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, of ardent character, such as the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> portrays St. Peter, while a comparison with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, words, and expressions of the First Epistle affords a further argument in favour of the identify of the author. Such, at least, is the opinion of several critics.

<p>In examining the difficulties raised against the authenticity of the Epistle, the following facts should be remembered: (a) This Epistle has been wrongly accused of being imbued with Hellenism, from which it is even farther removed than the writings of Luke and the Epistles of Paul. (b) Likewise the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> which it opposes are not the full-blown <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> of the second century, but the budding <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> as opposed by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. (c) The difference which some authors claim to find between the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the two Epistles probes nothing against the authenticity; some others have even maintained that comparison of the doctrines furnishes a new argument in favour of the author's identify. Doubtless there exist undeniable differences, but is an author <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confine himself within the same circle of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>? (d) The difference of style which critics have discovered between the two Epistles is an argument requiring too delicate handling to supply a certain conclusion, and here again some others have drawn from a similarity of style an argument in favour of a unity of authorship. Admitting that the manner of speaking is not the same in both Epistles, there is, nevertheless, not the slightest difficulty, if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> has said (see above under FIRST EPISTLE), that in the composition of the Epistles St. Peter made use of different interpreters. (e) It is also incorrect to say that this Epistle supposes the Epistle of St. Paul to have been already collected (iii, 15-16), for the author does not say that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. That he should have regarded Paul's letters as inspired forms a difficulty only to those who do not admit the possibility of a revelation made to Peter on this point. Some authors have also wrongly contested the unity of the Epistle, some claiming that it consists of two distinct epistles, the second beginning with ch. iii, others maintaining that the ii, 1-iii, 2, has been interpolated. Recently M. Ladeuze (Revue Biblique, 1905) has advanced an hypothesis which seems to end numerous difficulties: by an involuntary <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a copyist or by accidental transposition of the leaves of the codex on which the Epistle was written, one of the parts of the Epistle was transposed, and according to the order of sections the letter should be restored as follows: i-ii, 3a; iii, 1-16; ii, 3b-22; iii, 17-18. The hypothesis seems very probable.

<p><em>Relations of II Peter with the Epistle of Jude</em>

<p>This Epistle has so much in common with that of Jude that the author of one must have had the other before him. There is no agreement on the question of priority, but the most credited opinion is that Peter depends on Jude (q.v.).
<h3 id="B">Recipients, occasion, and object</h3>

<p>It is believed that this Epistle, like the First, was sent to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, the majority of whom were converted <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (iii, 1-2; ii, 11-12; etc.). False teachers (ii, 1), <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and deceivers (iii, 3), of corrupt <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> (ii, 1) and denying the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Second Advent</a> of Christ and the end of the world, sought to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Peter wrote to excite them to the practice of virtue and chiefly to turn them away from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and bad example of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers.
<h3 id="C">Date and place of composition</h3>

<p>While those who reject the authenticity of the Epistle place it about 150, the advocates of its authenticity maintain that it was written after 63-4, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the First Epistle, and before 64-5, the date believed to be that of the death of St. Peter (i, 14). Like the First, it was written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
<h3 id="D">Analysis</h3>

<p>In the exordium the Apostle, after the inscription and salutation (i, 1-2), recalls the magnificent gifts bestowed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> on the faithful; he exhorts them to the practice of virtue and all the more earnestly that he is convinced that his death is approaching (3-15). In the body of the Epistle (i, 16-iii, 13) the author brings forward the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the second coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which he proves, recalling His glorious transfiguration and the prediction of the Prophets (i, 16-21). Then he inveighs against the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers and condemns their life and doctrines: (a) They shall undergo Divine chastisement, in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which the Apostle recalls the punishment inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">rebel angels</a>, on the contemporaries of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, on the people of Sodom and Gomorrah (ii, 1-11). (b) He describes the immoral life of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers, their impurity and sensuality, their <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and duplicity (12-22). (c) He refutes their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, showing that they are wrong in rejecting the second coming of Christ and the end of the world (iii, 1-4), for the Judge shall certainly come and that unexpectedly; even as the ancient world perished by the waters of the flood so the present world shall perish by fire and be replaced by a new world (5-7). Then follows the moral conclusion: let us live holily, if we desire to be ready for the coming of the Judge (8-13); let us employ the time given us to work out our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even as Paul taught in his Epistles which the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers abuse (14-17). Verse 18 consists of the epilogue and <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>.
