<h1>Ercole Gonzaga</h1>  

<p>(Hercules.)

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, 23 November, 1505; d. 2 March, 1563. He was the Son of the Marquess Francesco, and nephew of Cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga (1469-1525). He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Bologna under Pomponazzi, and later took up <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In 1520, or as some say, 1525, his uncle Sigismondo renounced in his favour the <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">See of Mantua</a>; in 1527 his mother Isabella brought him back from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the insignia of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. Notwithstanding his youth, he showed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for church reform, especially in his own diocese; and in this he received help and encouragement from his friend Cardinal Giberti, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. His mode of life was stainless and a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> work of his, "Vitae Christianae institutio", bears witness to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. He published a Latin <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and built the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, thus carrying out reforms urged by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, as his friends <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, Gilberti, Caraffa, and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had done or were doing, even before the council had assembled. His charity was unbounded, and many young men of talent and genius had their <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> expenses paid by him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> employed him on many embassies, e.g. to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in 1530. Because of his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and his business-like methods, he was a favourite with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and Ferdinand I, and with the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and Henry II. From 1540 to 1556 he was guardian to the young sons of his brother Federico II who had died, and in their name he governed the Dutchy of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. The elder of the boys, Francesco died in 1550 and was succeeded by his brother Guglielmo. In the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1559 it was thought he would certainly be made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> would not choose as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a scion of a ruling house. In 1561 Pius IV named him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, for which he had from the beginning laboured by every means at his command, moral and material. In its early stages, owing to the fact that not a few considered he was in favour of Communion under both kinds, he met with many difficulties, and interested motives were attributed to him. Nothing but the express wish of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could have persuaded him to remain at his post, and the energy he displayed was unwearied. He contracted fever at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, where he died, attended by Father Lainez. His benefactions to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/10534d.htm">Monte di Pieta</a> were very great, and his letters are invaluable to the historian of that period.
