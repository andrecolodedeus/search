<h1>Erdington Abbey</h1>  

<p>Erdington Abbey, situated in a suburb of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, Warwickshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregation of St. Martin of Beuron, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and is dedicated to <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>. Driven from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the Falk <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> four of these exiled <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> went to Erdington at the request of <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne, O.S.B.</a>, and of the Rev. Daniel Haigh, M.A., a convert <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> who gave them the splendid <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> which he had built and embellished out of his own private fortune, as a thank-offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> for the gift of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. Father Haigh's modest presbytery was the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and here Dom Placid Walter, Arch-Abbot of the Beuron Congregation, Dom Hildebrand de Hempstine, later Abbot <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, Dom Leo Linse, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fort Augustus in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, Dom Leodgar Stocker, and a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> took up their abode in October, 1876. Dom Placid was the first prior. Two years later, Dom Hildebrand succeeded Dom Placid, and at once set about building a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> that would accommodate a community large enough to chant the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir. It was finished in 1880, when the number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was increased to eleven with three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>.

<p>Meanwhile Father Haigh had found his last resting-place in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, so the untenanted presbytery was converted into a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the first of its kind in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, with Dom Wilfrid Wallace, an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who had lately joined the community, as head master. Dom Leo Linse became prior in 1882, and was succeeded in 1886 by Dom Boniface Wolff, who was followed, in turn, by Dom Silvester Schlecht in 1895. On the feast of the Assumption, 1896, the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was transformed into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, though three years elapsed before it received an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. These were years of spiritual and material development. A <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for oblates, several members were added to the community, and a large addition made to the monastic buildings. These comprised the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> apartments and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, rooms for guests, entrance hall, parlours, novitiate, and clericate. They were completed and blessed in 1898. In July, 1899, Dom Ansgar H&ouml;ckelmann was appointed its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and he was blessed in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church on 3 Sept., by Bishop Ilsley of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>. Since then a spacious refectory and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> have been built, and the community continues to grow.
