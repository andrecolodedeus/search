<h1>Erie</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF ERIE (ERIENSIS).

<p>Established 1853; it embraces the thirteen counties of North-Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, U.S.A.: Erie, Crawford, Warren, McKean, Potter, Mercer, Venango, Forest, Elk, Cameron, Clarion, Jeferson, and Clearfield, an area of 10,027 square miles.

<p>This territory enjoys the distinction of having been under three different national and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> governments: under the French flag and the See of Quebec from 1753 to 1758; under the English flag and the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> from 1758 to the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 3 September, 1783, and the erection of the See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1789; under the American flag since the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and a part of the See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> until the establishment of the Diocese of Philadelphia in 1808. In August, 1843, when the Diocese of Pittsburg was formed, it included all that part of the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a> west of a line running along the eastern border of Bedford, Huntingdon, Clearfield, Elk, McKean, and Potter counties, and consequently, the territory of the present Diocese of Erie.

<p>In 1853 the Right Rev. Michael O'Connor, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, through the Fifth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, for a division of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and took for himself the poorest part, and thus became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Diocese of Erie. When Bishop O'Connor assumed the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 29 July, 1853, there were only twenty-eight churches with eleven <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and three <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> to attend to the wants of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered throughout the thirteen counties. At the urgent request and petition of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, Bishop O'Connor was restored to them, having governed the Diocese of Erie for the short period of seven months.

<p>His successor at Erie was the Rev. Josue Moody Young, a member of an old <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a>, New England <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, born 29 Oct., 1808, at Shapleigh, Maine. He became a convert from Congregationalism and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in October, 1828, by the famous New England missionary, Father Charles D. Ffrench, O.P., when he then changed the Moody of his name to Maria. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 1 April, 1838, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Erie, in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a>, on 23 April, 1854. The outlook at his accession was gloomy. Many of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were affiliated with Pittsburg before the division, returned there with Bishop O'Connor. Among those who cast their lot with the new diocese the most noteworthy were the Very Rev. John D. Coady, Revs. Anthony Reek, Joseph Hartman, M. A. De La Roque, John Berbegier, Andrew Skopez, Kieran O'Brannigan, and also Messrs. John Koch and Thomas Lonnergan, at that time studying for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. There were but two churches in Erie city, St. Patrick's, the pro-cathedral, and St. Mary's, built for a German congregation by Rev. Joseph Hartman. Outside the city there were twenty-eight churches, with eleven <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and three <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 12,000. The church buildings outside the city of Erie were mostly wooden structures. There was only one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The discovery of petroleum on Oil Creek, 28 August, 1859, gave a great impetus to both secular and religious progress throughout the diocese. To accommodate the settlers that located in the valleys of Oil Creek and the Allegheny River, where towns sprang up as by magic, churches were hastily erected, but the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was still inadequate. As there were no railroads Bishop Young's labours were in the beginning very heavy. He died suddenly 18 September, 1866. At his death the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population had more than doubled, and several new churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> had sprung into existence.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Very Rev. John D. Coady, governed the diocese during the interregnum until the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Rev. Tobias Mullen, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 2 August, 1868. He was born in the County Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 4 March, 1818, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, 1 Sept., 1844, having gone there with Bishop O'Connor from Maynooth the previous year as a volunteer for the American mission. Under his direction a new era began, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> sprang up, churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were built, regular conferences for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were held. Religious orders were introduced and new institutions arose for the maintenance and spread of religion, and for the enlightenment, and comfort, and shelter of suffering humanity. The frame churches gave place to brick and stone structures. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself was a tireless worker and infused his own spirit into his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly, the "Lake Shore Visitor", was issued, edited mostly by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself, in the midst of labours that called him to every part of his extensive diocese. The Poles, the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, the Hungarians, and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> had churches and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> provided for them, the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> a large new home, the sick were provided with two large <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and finally his crowning work, St. Peter's Cathedral, was finished, clear of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1893, the twenty-fifth anniversary of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. In the following year he celebrated the golden jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. His strong active mind and body began to fail and on 19 May, 1897, he suffered a paralytic stroke and a coadjutor, the Rev. John E. Fitz Maurice, president of St. Charles's Seminary, Overbrook, Philadelphia, was chosen by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01430b.htm">Amisus</a> with right of succession in Philadelphia, 24 February, 1898. Bishop Mullen resigned, 10 August, 1899, and died, 22 April, 1900. Bishop Fitz Maurice succeeded as fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, on 19 September, 1899, and the good work inaugurated under the late <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> went on quietly and steadily. He was born at Newtown-Sandes, County Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 9 Jan., 1840, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Philadelphia, 21 Dec., 1862. After officiating in several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1886.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, the Brothers of Mary, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns, the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>. At one time the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the Bridgettines, and the Sisters of the Humility of Mary had houses in the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> settled at St. Mary's, Elk county, under Bishop O'Connor and in 1858 took charge of St. Mary's, Erie. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> in 1875 began their foundation, purchasing a <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> college--at Northeast--which they made a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college for young men who intended to join their order. They have 142 students.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> entered the diocese in 1860, and have charge of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, the home for the aged, and the two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, the Academy of Villa Maria, the mother-house in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and of fifteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, who entered the diocese 24 September, 1870, besides the academy in Titusville, the mother-house, have charge of eight <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Sisters of St. Benedict (St. Mary's, Penn.) (22 July, 1852) have St. Benedict's Academy, the mother-house at St. Mary's, and teach seven <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The (Erie) Sisters of St. Benedict, besides the academy and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Mary's Church, teach five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and also conduct an academy in Sharon. The <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a> teach St. Stanislaus' Polish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, in the city of Erie.

<p>There are in the diocese 100 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 46 missions with churches, and 11 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 160 priests--135 secular, 25 regular; 45 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 3 academies for young ladies, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> with 216 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, making a total of young people under the care of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, 10,385; two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and one home for the aged. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is estimated at 121,108.
