<h1>Ernst von Lasaulx</h1>  

<p>Scholar and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, born at Coblenz, 16 March, 1805; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 9 May, 1861. His father, Johann Claudius von Lasaulx, was a distinguised architect; his uncle, Johann Joseph G&ouml;rres, was the fiery champion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> liberties; and the young Ernst became imbued with an enthusiam for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and for liberty. He first studied at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> (1824-30), and later took up classical philology and philosophy at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, attaching himself in particular to Schelling, G&ouml;rres, and Baader, and then spent four years travelling through <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and Palestine, visiting the places most famous in the history of civilization, both <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. His voyage to Athens was made as a member of the suite of Prince Otto of Wittelsbach (Bavaria), who had been elected King of the Hellenes. On his return to his native land he took the doctor's degree at Kiel, in 1835, presenting a dissertation entitled "De mortis dominatu in veteres, commentatio theologica-philosophica", and was appointed <em>dozent</em> in classical philology at the <a href="../cathen/15720a.htm">University of W&uuml;rzburg</a>, where he exercised a deep and far-reaching influence on the youth of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Meanwhile he married Julie Baader, daughter of the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Franz Baader.

<p>Upon the arrest (20 November, 1837) of Clemens August, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, whose forcible detention in the fortress of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a> by the order of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government caused a great stir in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles both at home and abroad, Lasaulx wrote to his uncle, G&ouml;rres, calling upon him to protest against the arbitrary act of the "military Government of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>". This was the impulse that was responsible for G&ouml;rres's celebrated "Athanasius". At the same time Lasaulx himself issued the controversial pamphlet "Kritische Bemerkungen &uuml;ber die K&ouml;lner Sache", a bold attack on the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government and the diplomat Josias von Bunsen. In the autumn of 1844 Lasaulx was appointed professor of philology and &aelig;sthetics at the University of Munich, despite the vigorous efforts of the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> senate to secure his continued services there. At <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> he quickly became famous as a magnetic and stimulating teacher. When his influence effected the downfall of the minister Abel, the senate of the University applauded his action, but King Louis, on the other hand, vented his displeasure by dismissing Lasaulx from office (28 February, 1847). Demonstrations on the part of the students followed, resulting in the dismissal of eight other members of the University teaching staff. In 1848 Lasaulx, with three of his former colleagues, was elected to the National Assembly at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, where he identified himself with the Conservative group and again and again eloquently defended the liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> elite of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>King Maximilian II having at length yielded to the petition of the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> students to reinstate Lasaulx and the other expelled professors (15 March, 1849), Lasaulx resumed his work as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writer. In the same year he was elected a member of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Chamber of Deputies, where, until his death, his masterly ability in all political controversies found energetic expression. Soon after his death, four of his works were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>; it was found that in them he had <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> on the side of effacing the distinction between the common human <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> element in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> expression of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. Several years earlier, however, he had declared that, should any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> be found in his works, he would freely submit to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
