<h1>Erwin of Steinbach</h1>  

<p>One of the architects of the Strasburg <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 17 January, 1318. According to a tradition which arose in a later age he was called Erwin of Steinbach, and a monument has been erected to him in the village of Steinbach near Baden-Baden. Two of his sons, Erwin and Johannes, after them his grandson Gerlach, from 1341-71 and, up to 1382, another scion of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> named Kuntze, were also superintending architects. Hence they were heads of the Strasburg guild of stone-masons, the influence of which extended as far as <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and the borders of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. No written account exists as to the training for his work which the elder Erwin received. It must, however, be taken for granted that he had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his abilities as a master-builder in other places before he was entrusted with the construction of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> about the year 1277. His work on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> shows the influence of the French Gothic. When Erwin took charge of the construction the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed except the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the tower, and reflected in its parts the development of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> styles from the first quarter of the eleventh century. As a matter of fact, the west front was now built by three masters, of whom one was Erwin. At the same time a part of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> that had been badly damaged by fire in 1298 had to be repaired. Three plans of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> are still in existence; according to Dehio the best design belongs to Erwin, to whom it is customary to ascribe the entire construction. Eichborn, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has tried to prove that Erwin drew the weakest of the three plans. In any case the three master-architects by their joint work deserve the praise that, especially since Goethe, has been assigned to Erwin alone; they are not responsible, however, for the ungraceful central screen of the third story between the towers, nor for the pinnacle of the north tower. This front offers a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> combination of horizontal members in the French style with the German principle of daring height. The rose-window, also French in design and placed in the central one of the nine fields, gives a welcome point of rest to the eye. The somewhat peculiar ornamentation consists of a double tracery of bars and geometrical designs which covers the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> like a net dividing and filling the large surfaces. By the novelty and the daring of the new style the individual members of this <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> are in marked contrast to the older parts of the building; the front, moreover, is connected directly with the body of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The ornamental <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of the building, which is richer than that ordinarily found in German <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, is attributed to Erwin's workshop, from which came also the monument to Conrad of Lichtenberg in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. John. In this <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> the early Gothic forms correspond to the carving in the chapter-hall. Erwin's last work was the construction of the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. The legend of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, Savina, who, it is asserted, was a daughter of Erwin, rests on a mistaken interpretation of the words of a scroll. The inscriptions referring to Erwin, which along with tradition are our only sources of information, have also given rise to various <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>.
