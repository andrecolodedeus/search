<h1>Erycius Puteanus</h1>  

<p>(ERRIJCK DE PUT)

<p>Born at Venloo, in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Limbourg, 4 Nov., 1574; died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 17 Sept., 1646. A <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> and philologist, he studied at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Dordrecht and Cologne (Coll&egrave;ge des Trois-Couronnes), where he took the degree of Master of Arts, 28 Feb., 1595. He then followed, at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, the lectures on ancient history given by Justus Lipsius. In 1597 he repaired to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and lived in intimacy with the learned men of that country, especially the famous <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a>, through whom he was appointed professor of Latin at the Palatine School of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> from 1600 to 1606, when the States of Brabant offered him the chair left vacant by Lipsius at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. He taught with &eacute;clat at the Coll&egrave;ge des Trois-Langues for forty years, and was loaded with favours by reigning princes: the Archduke Albert appointed him his honorary counsellor (1612), and increased his annual pension by 200 ducats (1614), and added the reversion of Ch&acirc;teau-C&eacute;sar. At the same time he filled, after 1603, the post of historiographer to King Philip IV, on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a>, with other appointments, often ill-paid in consequence of a treasury depleted by continual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. His rash language provoked political animosities, and he was almost driven into exile by request of King James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who wrongly believed him to be the author of an injurious lampoon.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> numbered seventeen children, of whom four died in infancy. The services he rendered to his native Guelders, the Low Countries, and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> were considerable. Puteanus was an encyclopedist; his ideal, which saw in numerous and varied acquirements the fullest measure of wisdom and the surest means of arriving at virtue the end of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, had been suggested to him by his master Justus Lipsius. During a certain period of his literary activity (1603-19), he detached himself from Lipsius by aiming at personal leadership of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He dreamed of re-establishing in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the splendid classical period and the cult of eloquence which he had derived from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. When he saw the uselessness of his efforts, the indifference of a too <a href="../cathen/15241c.htm">utilitarian</a> age inclined towards positive <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, he again threw himself into encyclopedic authorship and produced his best chronological works. His merit as a philologist is somewhat limited; but his dissertations, reproduced in the Thesauri of Gr&aelig;vius and Gronovius, are of real value and may still be consulted. As a whole, his influence on <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> philology has been unfortunate.
