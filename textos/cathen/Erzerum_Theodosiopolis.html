<h1>Erzerum (Theodosiopolis)</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF ERZERUM (ERZERUMIENSIS ARMENIORUM).

<p>The native name, Garin (Gr. <em>Karenitis</em>; <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a>, Kalikelah), is still used by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. The kings of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> established here their summer residence. Later Garin fell into the power of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, who named it Theodosiopolis (415), under which title it is still a Latin <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. It became then a Greek <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, suffragan to Caesarea of Cappacocia. Three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known at this period, Peter (448), Manasses (451), and another Peter (553). (See <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a>, Or. christ., I, 437.) This <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> situation lasted at least until the ninth century. In the eleventh century, owing to a confusion with another Theodosiopolis in Mesopotamia, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> passed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. From 622 to 633, a great council, which brought about a temporary union of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and Greek Churches, was held at Garin; the Emperor Heraclius attended with the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of both Churches (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, III, 73, 132). In 1201 the city was plundered by the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who named it ErzerumTheodosiopolis), which appears to mean "the country of the Romans", that is to say of the Greeks, though some think that the name is a corruption of Arzen er-Roum, Arzen being an ancient <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> city in the neighbourhood. ErzerumTheodosiopolis) was captured in 1214 by the sultans of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, in 1387 by Timur-Leng, in 1400 by the Osmanli <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In 1430 it fell into the power of local dynasties, which held it under the hegemony of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> until 1514, when it passed again to the Osmanlis. In 1828 and 1878 it was occupied by the Russians. In 1859 it was almost destroyed by an earthquake.

<p>Erzerum is built at an altitude of over six thousand feet on a hill, which is surrounded by mountains of some ten thousand feet in height. The climate is healthful, but rigorous. Winter lasts eight and summer only four months. The Western Euphrates (Kara Su) is about four miles from the city. Garin is the capital of a vilayet and has a population of about 40,000, of whom 27,000 are <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the rest <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, Greeks, and a few <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> (about 900 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> mostly <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>). The city is divided into three parts; the citadel, near the centre of the city, the city proper surrounded by a double wall, and four suburbs. There are 65 mosques, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and several large bazaars. The chief industries are blacksmiths' and coppersmiths' work. Besides the Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, still subject to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Gregorian and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reside at ErzerumTheodosiopolis). The <a href="../cathen/14577c.htm">Diocese of Theodosiopolis</a> (Erzerum) was re-established in 1850 and on 10 July, 1883, divided into the Dioceses of ErzerumTheodosiopolis) and <a href="../cathen/10647b.htm">Mush</a>. The former diocese has (1909) 10,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 38 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 66 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 19 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with about 1000 pupils, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Sisters of the Immaculate Conception have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> conduct the Latin mission.
