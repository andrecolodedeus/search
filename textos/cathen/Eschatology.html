<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Eschatology</h1>  

<p>That branch of systematic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> which deals with the doctrines of the last things (<em>ta eschata</em>). The Greek title is of comparatively recent introduction, but in modern usage it has largely supplanted its Latin equivalent <em>De Novissimis</em>. As the numerous <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> subjects belonging to this section of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> will be treated <em>ex professo</em> under their several proper titles, it is proposed in this article merely to take such a view of the whole field as will serve to indicate the place of eschatology in the general framework of religion, explain its subject-matter and the outlines of its content in the various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and illustrate by comparison the superiority of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> eschatological teaching.

<p>As a preliminary indication of the subject-matter, a distinction may be made between the eschatology of the individual and that of the race and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> at large. The former, setting out from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of personal <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, or at least of survival in some form after death, seeks to ascertain the fate or condition, temporary or eternal, of individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and how far the issues of the future depend on the present life. The latter deals with events like the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and the general judgment, in which, according to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation, all men will participate, and with the signs and portents in the moral and physical order that are to precede and accompany those events. Both aspects &#151; the individual and the universal &#151; belong to the adequate concept of eschatology; but it is only in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> that both receive due and proportionate recognition. Jewish eschatology only attained its completion in the teaching of Christ and the Apostles; while in ethnic religion eschatology seldom rose above the individual view, and even then was often so vague, and so little bound up with any adequate notion of Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of moral retribution, that it barely deserves to be ranked as religious teaching.
<h2 id="section1">Ethnic eschatologies</h2>
<h3>Uncivilized societies</h3>

<p>Even among uncivilized cultures the universality of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, including <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in some kind of existence after death, is very generally admitted by modern anthropologists. Some exceptions, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, have been claimed to exist; but on closer scrutiny the evidence for this claim has broken down in so many cases that we are justified in presuming against any exception. Among the uncivilized the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and purity of eschatological <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> vary, as a rule, with the purity of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the moral standards that prevail. Some savages seem to limit existence after death to the good (with extinction for the wicked), as the Nicaraguas, or to men of rank, as the Tongas; while the <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenlanders</a>, <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, and others seem to hold the possibility of a second death, in the other world or on the way to it. The next world itself is variously located &#151; on the earth, in the skies, in the sun or moon &#151; but most commonly under the earth; while the life led there is conceived either as a dull and shadowy and more or less impotent existence, or as an active continuation in a higher or idealized form of the pursuits and pleasures of earthly life. In most savage <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> there is no very high or definite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of moral retribution after death; but it is only in the case of a few of the most degraded cultures, whose condition is admittedly the result of degeneration, that the notion of retribution is claimed to be altogether wanting. Sometimes mere physical prowess, as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> or skill in the hunt or in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, takes the place of a strictly <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> standard; but, on the other hand, some savage <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> contain unexpectedly clear and elevated <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of many primary moral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>.
<h3>Civilized cultures</h3>

<p>Coming to the higher or civilized <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, we shall glance briefly at the eschatology of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> and Assyrian, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, Indian, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, and Greek <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a> can hardly be said to have an eschatology, except the very indefinite <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> involved in the worship of ancestors, whose <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> was held to depend on the conduct of their living descendants. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamic</a> eschatology contains nothing distinctive except the glorification of barbaric sensuality.

<p><em>(a) Babylonian and Assyrian</em>

<p>In the ancient <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> religion (with which the Assyrian is substantially identical) eschatology never attained, in the historical period, any high degree of development. Retribution is confined almost, if not quite, entirely to the present life, virtue being rewarded by the Divine bestowal of strength, prosperity, long life, numerous offspring, and the like, and wickedness punished by contrary temporal calamities. Yet the existence of an hereafter is believed in. A kind of semi-material ghost, or shade, or double (<em>ekimmu</em>), survives the death of the body, and when the body is buried (or, less commonly, <a href="../cathen/04481c.htm">cremated</a>) the ghost descends to the underworld to join the company of the departed. In the "Lay of Ishtar" this underworld, to which she descended in search of her deceased lover and of the "waters of life", is described in gloomy colours; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the other descriptions we possess. It is the "pit", the "land of no return", the "house of darkness", the "place where dust is their bread, and their food is mud"; and it is infested with demons, who, at least in Ishtar's case, are empowered to inflict various chastisements for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed in the upper world.



<p>Though Ishtar's case is held by some to be typical in this respect, there is otherwise no clear indication of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of moral penalties for the wicked, and no promise of rewards for the good. Good and bad are involved in a common dismal fate. The location of the region of the dead is a subject of controversy among Assyriologists, while the suggestion of a brighter hope in the form of a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (or rather of a return to earth) from the dead, which some would infer from the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the "waters of life" and from references to Marduk, or Merodach, as "one who brings the dead to life", is an extremely <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> conjecture. On the whole there is nothing hopeful or satisfying in the eschatology of this ancient religion.

<p><em>(b) Egyptian</em>

<p>On the other hand, in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion, which for antiquity competes with the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, we meet with a highly developed and comparatively elevated eschatology. Leaving aside such difficult questions as the relative priority and influence of different, and even conflicting, elements in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion, it will suffice for the present purpose to refer to what is most prominent in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> eschatology taken at its highest and best. In the first place, then, life in its fullness, unending life with Osiris, the sun-god, who journeys daily through the underworld, even identification with the god, with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be called by his name, is what the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> looked forward to as the ultimate goal after death. The departed are habitually called the "living"; the coffin is the "chest of the living", and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> the "lord of life". It is not merely the disembodied spirit, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as we understand it, that continues to live, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with certain bodily organs and functions suited to the conditions of the new life. In the elaborate anthropology which underlies <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> eschatology, and which we find it hard to understand, several constituents of the human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> are distinguished, the most important of which is the <em>Ka</em>, a kind of semi-material double; and to the justified who pass the judgment after death the use of these several constituents, separated by death is restored.

<p>This judgment which each undergoes is described in detail in chapter 125 of the Book of the Dead. The examination covers a great variety of personal, social, and religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and observances; the deceased must be able to deny his guilt in regard to forty-two great categories of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and his heart (the symbol of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and morality) must stand the test of being weighed in the balance against the image of Maat, goddess of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But the new life that begins after a favourable judgment is not at first any better or more spiritual than life on earth. The justified is still a wayfarer with a long and difficult journey to accomplish before he reaches bliss and security in the fertile fields of Aalu. On this journey he is exposed to a variety of disasters, for the avoidance of which he depends on the use of his revivified powers and on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he has gained in life of the directions and magical charms recorded in the Book of the Dead, and also, and perhaps most of all, on the aids provided by surviving friends on earth. It is they who secure the preservation of his corpse that he may return and use it, who provide an indestructible <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> as a home or shelter for his Ka, who supply food and drink for his sustenance, offer up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for his benefit, and aid his memory by inscribing on the walls of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, or writing on rolls of papyrus enclosed in the wrappings of the mummy, chapters from the Book of the Dead. It does not, indeed, appear that the dead were ever supposed to reach a state in which they were independent of these earthly aids. At any rate they were always considered free to revisit the earthly <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and in making the journey to and fro the blessed had the power of transforming themselves at will into various animal-shapes. It was this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> which, at the degenerate stage at which he encountered it, Herodotus mistook for the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. It should be added that the identification of the blessed with Osiris ("Osiris N. N." is a usual form of inscription) did not, at least in the earlier and higher stage of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion, imply <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> absorption in the deity or the loss of individual <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. Regarding the fate of those who fail in the judgment after death, or succumb in the second probation, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> eschatology is less definite in its teaching. "Second death" and other expressions applied to them might seem to suggest annihilation; but it is sufficiently clear from the evidence as a whole that continued existence in a condition of darkness and misery was believed to be their portion. And as there were degrees in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the blessed, so also in the punishment of the lost (Book of the Dead, tr. Budge, London, 1901).

<p><em>(c) Indian</em>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a>, the earliest historical form of the Indian religion, eschatological <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is simpler and purer than in the <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahministic</a> and Buddhistic forms that succeeded it. Individual <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is clearly taught. There is a kingdom of the dead under the rule of Yama, with distinct realms for the good and the wicked. The good dwell in a realm of light and share in the feasts of the gods; the wicked are banished to a place of "nethermost darkness". Already, however, in the later Vedas, where these <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and developed expression, retribution begins to be ruled more by ceremonial observances than by strictly moral tests. On the other hand, there is no trace as yet of the dreary <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of transmigration, but critics profess to discover the germs of later <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a> retribution gains in prominence and severity, but becomes hopelessly involved in transmigration, and is made more and more dependent either on sacrificial observances or on <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Though after death there are numerous heavens and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hells</a> for the reward and punishment of every degree of merit and demerit, these are not final states, but only so many preludes to further rebirths in higher or lower forms. <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> absorption in Brahma, the world- <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and only reality, with the consequent extinction of individual personalities - this is the only final solution of the problem of existence, the only <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to which man may ultimately look forward. But it is a <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which only a few may hope to reach after the present life, the few who have acquired a perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Brahma. The bulk of men who cannot rise to this high philosophic wisdom may succeed, by means of sacrificial observances, in gaining a temporary <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but they are destined to further births and deaths.

<p>Buddhist eschatology still further develops and modifies the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> side of the <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahministic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and culminates in what is, strictly speaking, the negation of eschatology and of all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> &#151; a religion without a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a lofty <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code without hope of reward or fear of punishment hereafter. Existence itself, or at least individual existence, is the primary <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and the craving for existence, with the many forms of desire it begets, is the source of all the misery in which life is inextricably involved. Salvation, or the state of Nirvana, is to be attained by the utter extinction of every kind of desire, and this is possible by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> &#151; not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a>, but the purely <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things. For all who do not reach this state of philosophic enlightenment or who fail to live up to its requirements &#151; that is to say for the vast bulk of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> &#151; there is nothing in prospect save a dreary cycle of deaths and rebirths with intercalated heavens and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hells</a>; and in <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> takes on a still more dread and inexorable character than pre-Buddhistic <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">BUDDHISM</a>.)

<p><em>(d) Persian</em>

<p>In the ancient Persian religion (<a href="../cathen/02154a.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>, Mazdaism, Parseeism) we meet with what is perhaps, in its better elements, the highest type of ethnic eschatology. But as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it in the Parsee literature, it contains elements that were probably borrowed from other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>; and as some of this literature is certainly post-Christian, the possibility of Jewish and even <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> having influenced the later eschatological developments is not to be lost sight of. The radical defect of the Persian religion was its <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> conception of deity. The physical and moral world is the theatre of a perpetual conflict between <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd)</a>, the good, and <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Angra-Mainyu (Ahriman)</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, principle, co-creators of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and of man. Yet the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle is not eternal <em>ex parte post</em>; he will finally be vanquished and exterminated. A pure <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> Providence promises at times to replace <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, but never quite succeeds &#151; the latest effort in this direction being the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in Zvran Akarana, or Boundless Time as the supreme deity above both <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman and Ormuzd</a>. Morality has its sanction not merely in future retribution, but in the present assurance that every good and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> deed is a victory for the cause of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>; but the call to the individual to be active in this cause, though vigorous and definite enough, is never quite free from ritual and ceremonial conditions, and as time goes on becomes more and more complicated by these observances, especially by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of purity. Certain elements are holy (fire, earth, water), certain others unholy or impure (dead bodies, the breath, and all that leaves the body, etc.); and to defile oneself or the holy elements by contact with the impure is one of the deadliest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Consequently corpses could not be buried or <a href="../cathen/04481c.htm">cremated</a>, and were accordingly exposed on platforms erected for the purpose, so that birds of prey might devour them. When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> leaves the body it has to cross the bridge of Chinvat (or Kinvad), the bridge of the Gatherer, or Accountant. For three days good and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> contend for the possession of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after which the reckoning is taken and the just men is rejoiced by the apparition, in the form of a fair maiden, of his good deeds, words, and thoughts, and passes over safely to a <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> of bliss, while the wicked man is confronted by a hideous apparition of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds, and is dragged down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. If the judgment is neutral the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is reserved in an intermediate state (so at least in the Pahlavi books) till the decision at the last day. The developed conception of the last days, as it appears in the later literature, has certain remarkable affinities with Jewish <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> and millennial expectations. A time during which <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman</a> will gain the ascendancy is to be followed by two millennial periods, in each of which a great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> will appear to herald the coming of Soshyant (or Sosioch), the Conqueror and Judge who will raise the dead to life. The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> will occupy fifty-seven years and will be followed by the general judgement, the separation of the good from the wicked, and the passing of both through a <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial fire</a> gentle for the just, terrible for sinners, but leading to the restoration of all. Next will follow the final combat between the good and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, in which the latter will perish, all except <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman</a> and the serpent Azhi, whose destruction is reserved to <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> and Scraosha, the priest-god. And last of all <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself will be purged, and the earth renewed by purifying fire.

<p><em>(e) Greek</em>

<p>Greek eschatology as reflected in the Homeric poems remains at a low level. It is only very vaguely retributive and is altogether cheerless in its outlook. Life on earth, for all its shortcomings, is the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">highest good</a> for men, and death the worst of evils. Yet death is not extinction. The <em>psyche</em> survives - not the purely spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of later Greek and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought, but an attenuated, semi-material ghost, or shade, or image, of the earthly man; and the life of this shade in the underworld is a dull, impoverished, almost functionless existence. Nor is there any distinction of fates either by way of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> or of misery in Hades. The judicial office of Minos is illusory and has nothing to do with earthly conduct; and there is only one allusion to the Furies suggestive of their activity among the dead (Iliad XIX, 258-60). Tartarus, the lower <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, is reserved for a few special rebels against the gods, and the Elysian Fields for a few special favourites chosen by divine caprice.

<p>In later Greek thought touching the future life there are notable advances beyond the Homeric state, but it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the average popular <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ever reached a much higher level. Among early <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> Anaxagoras contributes to the notion of a purely spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but a more directly religious contribution is made by the Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries, to the influence of which in brightening and moralizing the hope of a future life we have the concurrent witness of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, poets, and historians. In the Eleusinian mysteries there seems to have been no definite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching - merely the promise or assurance for the initiated of the fullness of life hereafter. With the Orphic, on the other hand, the divine origin and pre-existence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for which the body is but a temporary <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a retributive transmigration are more or less closely associated. It is hard to see how far the common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the people was influenced by these mysteries, but in poetical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> literature their influence is unmistakable. This is seen especially in Pindar among the poets, and in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Pindar has a definite promise of a future life of bliss for the good or the initiated, and not merely for a few, but for all. Even for the wicked who descend to Hades there is hope; having, purged their wickedness they obtain rebirth on earth, and if, during three successive existences, they prove themselves worthy of the boon, they will finally attain to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the Isles of the Blest. Though <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> teaching is vitiated by the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of pre-existence, <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>, and other serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> it represents the highest achievement of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> philosophic speculation on the subject of the future life. The divine dignity, spirituality, and essential <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being established, the issues of the future for every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are made clearly dependent on its moral conduct in the present life in the body. There is a divine judgment after death, a <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and an intermediate state for penance and purification; and rewards and punishments are graduated according to the merits and demerits of each. The incurably wicked are condemned to everlasting punishment in Tartarus; the less wicked or indifferent go also to Tartarus or to the Acherusian Lake, but only for a time; those eminent for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> go to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> home, the highest reward of all being for those who have purified themselves by philosophy.

<p>From the foregoing sketch we are able to judge both of the merits and defects of ethnic systems of eschatology. Their merits are perhaps enhanced when they are presented, as above, in isolation from the other features of the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> to which they belonged. Yet their defects are obvious enough; and even those of them that were best and most promising turned out, historically, to be failures. The precious elements of eschatological <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion were associated with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and were unable to save the religion from sinking to the state of utter degeneration in which it is found at the approach of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. Similarly, the still richer and more profound eschatologies of the Persian religion, vitiated by <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> and other corrupting influences, failed to realize the promise it contained, and has survived only as a ruin in modern Parseeism. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> speculative teaching failed to influence in any notable degree the popular religion of the Greco-Roman world; it failed to convert even the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> few; and in the hands of those who did profess to adopt it, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>, uncorrected by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> ran to seed in <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> and other forms of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Old Testament eschatology</h2>

<p>Without going into details either by way of exposition or of criticism, it will be sufficient to point out how <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> eschatology compares with ethnic systems, and how notwithstanding its deficiencies in point of clearness and completeness, it was not an unworthy preparation for the fullness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation.

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> eschatology, even in its earliest and most imperfect form, shares in the distinctive character which belongs to <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> religion generally. In the first place, as a negative distinction, we note the entire absence of certain <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and tendencies that have a large place in ethnic <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> or <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> no <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of pre-existence (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#vrs17">Wisdom 8:17-20</a> does not necessarily imply this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as has sometimes been contended) or of <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>; nor is there any trace, as might have been expected, of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> or practices. In the next place, on the positive side, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> stands apart from ethnic <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> in its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of man in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is pure and uncompromising <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is ruled by the wisdom, Justice, and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> of the one, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>. And man is created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His own image and likeness, and destined to relations of friendship and fellowship with Him. Here we have revealed in clear and definite terms the basal doctrines which are at the root of eschatological <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and which, once they had taken hold of the life of a people, were bound, even without new additions to the revelation, to safeguard the purity of an inadequate eschatology and to lead in time to richer and higher developments. Such additions and developments occur in <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> teaching; but before noticing them it is well to call attention to the two chief defects, or limitations, which attach to the earlier eschatology and continue, by their persistence in popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, to hinder more or less the correct understanding and acceptance by the Jewish people as a whole of the highest eschatological utterances of their own inspired teachers.

<p>(2) The first of these defects is the silence of the earlier and of some of the later books on the subject of moral retribution after death, or at least the extreme vagueness of such passages in these books as might be understood to refer to this subject. Death is not extinction; but Sheol, the underworld of the dead, in early Hebrew thought is not very different from the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Aralu or the Homeric Hades, except that Jahve is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> even there. It is a dreary abode in which all that is prized in life, including friendly intercourse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, comes to an end without any definite promise of renewal. Dishonour incurred in life or in death, clings to a man in Sheol, like the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he may have won by a virtuous life on earth; but otherwise conditions in Sheol are not represented as retributive, except in the vaguest way. Not that a more definite retribution or the hope of renewal to a life of blessedness is formally denied and excluded; it simply fails to find utterance in earlier <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> records. Religion is pre-eminently an affair of this life, and retribution works out here on earth. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which to us seems so strange, must, to be fairly appreciated, be taken in conjunction with the national as opposed to the individual viewpoint [see under (3) of this section]; and allowance must also be made for its pedagogic value for a people like the early Hebrews. Christ himself explains why Moses permitted <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> ("by reason of the hardness of your heart", <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs8">Matthew 19:8</a>); revelation and legislation had to be tempered to the capacity of a singularly practical and unimaginative people, who were more effectively confirmed in the worship and service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a vivid sense of His retributive providence here on earth than they would have been but a higher and fuller <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of future <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> with its postponement of moral rewards. Nor must we exaggerate the insufficiency of this early point of view. It gave a deep religious value and significance to every event of the present life, and raised morality above the narrow, <a href="../cathen/15241c.htm">utilitarian</a> standpoint. Not worldly prosperity as such was the ideal of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a>, but prosperity bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the gracious reward of fidelity in keeping His Commandments. Yet, when all has been said, the inadequacy of this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> for the satisfaction of individual aspirations must be admitted; and this inadequacy was bound to prove itself sooner or later in experience. Even the substitution of the national for the individual standpoint could not indefinitely hinder this result.

<p>(3) The tendency to sink the individual in the nation and to treat the latter as the religious unit was one of the most marked characteristics of Hebrew <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And this helped very much to support and prolong the other limitation just noticed, according to which retribution was looked for in this life. Deferred and disappointed personal hopes could be solaced by the thought of their present or future realization in the nation. It was only when the national calamities, culminating in the exile, had shattered for a time the people's hope of a glorious theocratic kingdom that the eschatology of the individual became prominent; and with the restoration there was a tendency to revert to the national point of view. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the 0.T. as a whole that the eschatology of the people overshadows that of the individual, though it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time that, in and through the former, the latter advances to a clear and definite assurance of a personal <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>, at least for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> who are to share, if found worthy, in the glories of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> Age.

<p>It is beyond the scope of this article to attempt to trace the growth or describe the several phases of this national eschatology, which centres in the hope of the establishment of a theocratic and <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> on earth (see <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">MESSIAS</a>). However spiritually this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> may be found expressed in <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> prophecies, as we read them now in the light of their progressive fulfillment in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> Dispensation, the Jewish people as a whole clung to a material and political interpretation of the kingdom, coupling their own domination as a people with the triumph of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the worldwide establishment of His rule. There is much, indeed, to account for this in the obscurity of the prophecies themselves. The <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> as a distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not always mentioned in connexion with the inauguration of the kingdom, which leaves room for the expectation of a theophany of Jahve in the character of judge and ruler. But even when the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and place of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> are distinctly foreshadowed, the fusion together in prophecy of what we have learned to distinguish as His first and His second coming tends to give to the whole picture of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> an eschatological character that belongs in reality only to its final stage. It is thus the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> in <a href="../bible/isa026.htm#vrs19">Isaiah 26:19</a>, and <a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs2">Daniel 12:2</a>, is introduced; and many of the descriptions foretelling "the day of the Lord", the judgment on <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the renovation of the earth and other phenomena that usher in that day while applicable in a limited sense to contemporary events and to the inauguration of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, are much more appropriately understood of the end of the world. It is not, therefore, surprising that the religious hopes of the Jewish nation should have be come so predominantly eschatological, and that the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, foreshortening the perspective of Divine Revelation, should have learned to look for the establishment on earth of the glorious <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are assured will be realized only in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at the close of the present <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>.

<p>(4) Passing from these general observations which seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> understanding of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> eschatology, a brief reference will be made to the passages which exhibit the growth of a higher and fuller <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The recognition of individual as opposed to mere corporate responsibility and retribution may be reckoned, at least remotely, as a gain to eschatology, even when retribution is confined chiefly to this life; and this principle is repeatedly recognized in the earliest books. (See <a href="../bible/gen018.htm#vrs25">Genesis 18:25</a>; <a href="../bible/exo032.htm#vrs33">Exodus 32:33</a>; <a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs22">Numbers 16:22</a>; <a href="../bible/deu007.htm#vrs10">Deuteronomy 7:10</a>; <a href="../bible/deu024.htm#vrs16">24:16</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki024.htm#vrs17">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki014.htm#vrs6">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="../bible/isa003.htm#vrs10">Isaiah 3:10 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/isa033.htm#vrs15">33:15 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/jer012.htm#vrs1">Jeremiah 12:1 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/jer017.htm#vrs5">17:5-10</a>; <a href="../bible/jer032.htm#vrs18">32:18 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/eze014.htm#vrs12">Ezekiel 14:12-20</a>; <a href="../bible/eze018.htm#vrs4">18:4, 18 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a>, <em>passim</em>; <a href="../bible/pro002.htm#vrs21">Proverbs 2:21 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/pro010.htm#vrs2">10:2</a>; <a href="../bible/pro011.htm#vrs19">11:19, 31</a>; etc.) It is recognized also in the very terms of the problem dealt with in the Book of Job.

<p>But, coming to higher things, we find in the <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a> and in <a href="../bible/job000.htm">Job</a> the clear expression of a hope or assurance for the just of a life of blessedness after death. Here is voiced, under <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a>, the innate craving of the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for everlasting fellowship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the protest of a strong and vivid <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against the popular conception of Sheol. Omitting <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> passages, it is enough to refer to Psalms xv (<a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">A.V.</a> xvi), xvi (<a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">A.V.</a> xvii), xlviii (<a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">A.V.</a> xlix), and lxxii (<a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">A.V.</a> lxxiii). Of these it is not impossible to explain the first two as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for deliverance from some imminent danger of death, but the assurance they express is too absolute and universal to admit this interpretation as the most natural. And this assurance becomes still more definite in the other two psalms, by reason of the contrast which death is asserted to introduce between the fates of the just and the impious. The same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> emerges in the Book of Job, first as a hope somewhat questionably expressed, and then as an assured conviction. Despairing of vindication in this life and rebelling against the thought that righteousness should remain finally unrewarded, the sufferer seeks consolation in the hope of a renewal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> friendship beyond the grave: "O that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me. If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> would I wait, till my release should come" (xiv, 13 sq.). In xvii, 18 - xvii, 9, the expression of this hope is more absolute; and in xix, 23-27, it takes the form of a definite <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that he will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his Redeemer: "But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand up at the last upon the earth [dust]; and after this my skin has been destroyed, yet from [al. without] my flesh shall I see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom I shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold, and not another" (25 - 27). In his risen body he will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> (LXX) reading: "and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth. And I shall be clothed again with my skill, and in my flesh I shall see my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (25 - 26).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> finds definite expression in the Prophets; and in <a href="../bible/isa026.htm#vrs19">Isaiah 26:19</a>: "thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall rise again. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust" etc.; and <a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs2">Daniel 12:2</a>: "and many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some unto everlasting life, and others to everlasting shame and contempt" etc., it is clearly a personal <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> that is taught &#151; in Isaias a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of righteous <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>; in Daniel, of both the righteous and the wicked. The judgment, which in Daniel is connected with the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, is also personal; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the judgment of the living (<a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>) which in various forms the prophecies connect with the "day of the Lord". Some of the Psalms (e.g. <a href="../bible/psa048.htm">48</a>) seem to imply a judgment of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, good and bad, after death; and the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of a future judgment of "every work, whether it be good or evil", is the final solution of the moral enigmas of earthly life offered by Ecclesiastes (xii, 13-14; cf. iii, 17). Coming to the later (deuterocanonical) books of the 0. T. we have clear evidence in II Mach. of Jewish <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> (vii, 9-14), but in the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the dead who have died in godliness (xi, 43 sqq.). And in the second and first centuries B.C., in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> literature, new eschatological developments appear, chiefly in the direction of a more definite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of retribution after death. The word <em>Sheol</em> is still most commonly understood of the general abode of the departed awaiting the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, this abode having different divisions for the reward of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked; in reference to the latter, <em>Sheol</em> is sometimes simply equivalent to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm"><em>hell</em></a>. <em>Gehenna</em> is the name usually applied to the final place of punishment of the wicked after the last judgment, or even immediately after death; while <em>paradise</em> is often used to designate the intermediate abode of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just and <em><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a></em> their home of final blessedness. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> use of these terms shows that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of His day were sufficiently familiar with their <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> meanings.
<h2 id="section3">Catholic eschatology</h2>

<p>In this article there is no critical discussion of <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> eschatology nor any attempt to trace the historical developments of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> from Scriptural and traditional data; only a brief conspectus is given of the developed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system. For critical and historical details and for the refutation of opposing views the reader is referred to the special articles dealing with the various doctrines. The eschatological summary which speaks of the "four last things" (death, judgment, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>) is popular rather than scientific. For systematic treatment it is best to distinguish between (A) individual and (B) universal and cosmic eschatology, including under (A): <ul> <li>death; <li>the particular judgment; <li><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, or the intermediate state; <li><a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, or eternal punishment;</ul> and under (B): <ul><li>the approach of the end of the world; <li>the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>; <li>the general judgment; and <li>the final consummation of all things.</ul> The superiority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> eschatology consists in the fact that, without professing to answer every question that idle curiosity may suggest, it gives a clear, consistent, satisfying statement of all that need at present be known, or can profitably be understood, regarding the eternal issues of life and death for each of us personally, and the final consummation of the cosmos of which we are a part.

<p>Death, which consists in the separation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, is presented under many aspects in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, but chiefly <ul><li>as being actually and historically, in the present order of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Providence, the consequence and penalty of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Adam's sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs17">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12</a>, etc.); <li>as being the end of man's period of probation, the event which decides his eternal destiny (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="../bible/joh009.htm#vrs4">John 9:4</a>; <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs40">Luke 12:40</a>; <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs19">16:19 sqq.</a>; etc.), though it does not exclude an intermediate state of purification for the imperfect who die in <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">God's grace</a>; and <li>as being universal, though as to its absolute universality (for those living at the end of the world) there is some room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> because of <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs14">1 Thessalonians 4:14 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs1">2 Timothy 4:1</a>.</ul>

<p><em>Particular Judgment</em>

<p>That a <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a> of each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes place at death is implied in many passages of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs22">Luke 16:22 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs43">23:43</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs25">Acts 1:25</a>; etc.), and in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, no. 588) regarding the speedy entry of each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p><em><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em>

<p><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is the abode of the blessed, where (after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection with glorified bodies</a>) they enjoy, in the company of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">immediate vision of God face to face</a>, being supernaturally elevated by the light of glory so as to be capable of such a vision. There are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> degrees of glory corresponding to degrees of merit, but all are unspeakably <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the eternal possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Only the perfectly pure and holy can enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; but for those who have attained that state, either at death or after a course of purification in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, entry into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not deferred, as has sometimes been <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> held, till after the General Judgment.

<p><em>Purgatory</em>

<p><a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> is the intermediate state of unknown duration in which those who die imperfect, but not in unrepented mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, undergo a course of penal purification, to qualify for admission into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. They share in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a> and are benefited by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD</a>). The denial of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> introduced a dismal blank in their eschatology and, after the manner of extremes, has led to extreme reactions.

<p><em>Hell</em>

<p><a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, designates the place or state of men (and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>) who, because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are excluded forever from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>. In this wide sense it applies to the state of those who die with only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> on their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, no. 588), although this is not a state of misery or of subjective punishment of any kind, but merely implies the objective privation of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> bliss, which is compatible with a condition of perfect natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. But in the narrower sense in which the name is ordinarily used, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is the state of those who are punished <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> for unrepented personal mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Beyond affirming the existence of such a state, with varying degrees of punishment corresponding to degrees of guilt and its eternal or unending duration, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> does not go. It is a terrible and mysterious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but it is clearly and emphatically taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> may deny the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in spite of the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and professing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who are unwilling to admit it, may try to explain away <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words; but it remains as the Divinely revealed solution of the problem of moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">HELL</a>.) Rival solutions have been sought for in some form of the theory of restitution or, less commonly, in the theory of annihilation or conditional <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The restitutionist view, which in its <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> form was condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 543, and later at the Fifth General Council (see <a href="../cathen/01599a.htm">APOCATASTASIS</a>), is the cardinal <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of modern Universalism, and is favoured more or less by liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. Based on an exaggerated optimism for which present experience offers no guarantee, this view assumes the all-conquering efficacy of the ministry of grace in a life of probation after death, and looks forward to the ultimate conversion of all sinners and the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> disappearance of moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Annihilationists, on the other hand, failing to find either in reason or Revelation any grounds for such optimism, and considering <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> itself to be a grace and not the natural attribute of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, believe that the finally impenitent will be annihilated or cease to exist &#151; that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will thus ultimately be compelled to confess the failure of His purpose and power.
<h3 id="B">Universal and cosmic eschatology</h3>

<p><em>The Approach of the End of the World</em>

<p>Notwithstanding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> express refusal to specify the time of the end (<a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs32">Mark 13:32</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs6">Acts 1:6 sq.</a>), it was a common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> among early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that the end of the world was near. This seemed to have some support in certain sayings of Christ in reference to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which are set down in the Gospels side by side with prophecies relating to the end (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm">Matthew 24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk021.htm">Luke 21</a>), and in certain passages of the Apostolic writings, which might, not unnaturally, have been so understood (but see <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs2">2 Thessalonians 2:2 sqq.</a>, where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> corrects this impression). On the other hand, Christ had clearly stated that the Gospel was to be preached to all nations before the end (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs14">Matthew 24:14</a>), and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> looked forward to the ultimate conversion of the Jewish people as a remote event to be preceded by the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs25">Romans 11:25 sqq.</a>). Various others are spoken of as preceding or ushering in the end, as a great <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs3">2 Thessalonians 2:3 sqq.</a>), or falling away from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or charity (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs8">Luke 18:8</a>; <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#vrs26">17:26</a>; <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs12">Matthew 24:12</a>), the reign of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and great social calamities and terrifying physical convulsions. Yet the end will come unexpectedly and take the living by surprise.

<p><em>The Resurrection of the Body</em>

<p>The visible coming (<em>parousia</em>) of Christ in power and glory will be the signal for the rising of the dead (see <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">RESURRECTION</a>). It is <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> that all the dead who are to be judged will rise, the wicked as well as the Just, and that they will rise with the bodies they had in this life. But nothing is defined as to what is required to constitute this identity of the risen and transformed with the present body. Though not formally defined, it is sufficiently certain that there is to be only one <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>, simultaneous for the good and the bad. (See <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">MILLENNIUM</a>.) Regarding the qualities of the risen bodies in the case of the just we have <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> description in <a href="../bible/1co015.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs43">Matthew 13:43</a>; <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs21">Philippians 3:21</a>) as a basis for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculation; but in the case of the damned we can only affirm that their bodies will be incorruptible.

<p><em>The General Judgment</em>

<p>Regarding the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">general judgment</a> there is nothing of importance to be added here to the graphic description of the event by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, who is to be Judge (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a>, etc.).

<p><em>The Consummation of All Things</em>

<p>There is mention also of the physical <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> sharing in the general consummation (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs13">2 Peter 3:13</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs19">Romans 8:19 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rev021.htm#vrs1">Revelation 21:1 sqq.</a>). The present <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth will be destroyed, and a new <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth take their place. But what, precisely, this process will involve, or what purpose the renovated world will serve is not revealed. It may possibly be part of the glorious Kingdom of Christ of which "there shall be no end". <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> militant reign is to cease with the accomplishment of His office as Judge (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs24">1 Corinthians 15:24 sqq.</a>), but as King of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> whom He has saved He will reign with them in glory forever.
