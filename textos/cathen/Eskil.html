<h1>Eskil</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, Sk&aring;ne, Sweden; b. about 1100; d. at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, 6 (7?) Sept., 1181; one of the most capable and prominent <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">princes of the Church</a> in Scandinavia. A man of profound <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he was always <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the welfare of the church, and was a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> and unselfish defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in its struggle against the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> usurpers. His father Christian was descended from an illustrious dynastic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Jutland and was related to several royal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. When twelve years of age the young Eskil was received into the renowned <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. Here, during a dangerous illness, he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by a vision of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, who, chiding him with his frivolous conduct, saved him from imminent perdition and restored his health, demanding five measures of different varieties of corn as a thank-offering. This vision was interpreted to mean that Eskil would attain high <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a> and establish five confraternities. In 1131, his uncle, Asser (Asger), the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, nominated him <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1134 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a>, and after Asser's death (1137) succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He successfully defended the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in spite of the protestations of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. He received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> through the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Cardinal Theodignus, who, with many Scandinavian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was present at the provincial Synod of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a> (1139). Eskil completed the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (Romanesque), which he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1145. On this occasion he increased the membership and the endowments of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and improved the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>On various occasions Eskil was involved in the internal political disputes of rival kings, even to the extent of being temporarily held captive in his own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, for which he was, however, later indemnified by various land-grants. During the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, Eskil, animated by the example of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, also preached a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Wends, which, unfortunately, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsuccessful. He, nevertheless, continued his campaign with youthful ardour, even in his old age, till, after the conquest of R&uuml;gen, the Wends accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In 1152 <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, was sent to Scandinavia to settle <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> was constituted a separate <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> with its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a> (Nidaros). Eskil remained <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>. He was also nominated <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Sweden and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for the North. By a proper selection of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for the higher <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices he effected an immense improvement in the standard of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. In 1161 he drew up a code of canon law for Sk&aring;ne, which, ten years later, was introduced into Seeland. The monastic orders are especially indebted to Eskil. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> he called the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> to N&aelig;stved; and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Regular Augustinians at Eskils&ouml; near Roskilde most probably traces its origin to him. Later he established the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Tommerup, Sk&aring;ne; the Knights of St. John also settled in Lund during his time. There was also, in Seeland, an establishment of <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, but only for a short time. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were especial favourites of Eskil, who founded their first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1144 at Herivadum near Helsingborg, which was soon followed by one at Esrom in Nordseeland (1154). From both of these various branches were established. Eskil corresponded with St. Bernard, whom he admired and revered. With a view to being admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> he visited St. Bernard at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> in 1152. Bernard refused him admission, pointing out that his services as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would be more beneficial to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large.

<p>Hearing of Bernard's death (1153), Eskil made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> grave and thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where all his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> privileges were ratified by <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV (Breakspear)</a>. Returning he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Thionville (at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>?). In a dignified letter to the kings and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> Eskil expressed his willingness rather to suffer innocently in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> prerogatives than to be ransomed. Having obtained his liberty in 1158, Eskil returned home, where he found King Waldemar sole sovereign. When the latter took the part of Victor, the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Eskil, faithful to <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, took refuge in foreign parts. Excepting a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem, he lived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Clairvaux), in close proximity to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1164 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Stephen of Alvastra, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>. After Waldemar's reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, Eskil returned home (1168). Subsequent to the solemn translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> (1169) martyr-duke, Knud Lavard (d. 1131), Waldemar's father, Eskil <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the king's seven-year-old son at Ringsted, 1170. After another sojourn at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> (1174-76), the venerable <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> received permission from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to resign and to nominate a successor. In the spring of 1177, in the presence of the king, numerous <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and a great concourse of people assembled in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, Eskil, having read the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, declared that he resigned on his own initiative, laid the official insignia on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, and, all consenting, designated Bishop Absalon of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> as his successor. He then retired to Clairvaux, spending his last days as a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as venerable. The question whether Eskil was married and had a daughter is a subject of controversy. Although the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a> did not generally obtain during his time, we may, nevertheless, infer from his strictly religious principles that Eskil did not ignore the provisions of canon law by marrying after his admission to Sacred orders.
