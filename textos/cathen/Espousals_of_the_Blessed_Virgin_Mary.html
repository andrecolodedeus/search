<h1>Espousals of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h1>  

<p>(DESPONSATIO BEAT&AElig; MARI&AElig; VIRGINIS)

<p>A feast of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a real matrimony was contracted by Joseph and Mary. Still Mary is called "espoused" to Joseph ("his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph", <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs18">Matthew 1:18</a>) because the matrimony was never consummated. The term <em>spouse</em> is applied to married people until their marriage is consummated (Colvenerius, Cal. Marian., 23 Jan.). Peter d'Ailly, chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. (died 1420), and his famous disciple, <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Jean Charlier, called Gerson</a>, were the first energetic propagators of the devotion in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Joseph. <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> worked many years to effect the institution of a special votive feast (Thursday of ember week in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>), the object of which should be the virginal espousal of Mary and Joseph. <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson's</a> friend, Henry Chicoti, canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, had bequeathed a certain sum for the celebration in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of this votive feast, for which <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> had composed a proper Office. It seems that <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> carried out the will of his friend, but tradition does not tell us on what day the feast was celebrated.

<p>The first definite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a feast in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the espousals of Mary dates from 29 Aug., 1517, when with nine other Masses in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Mary, it was granted by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to the Nuns of the Annunciation, founded by Sainte Jeanne de Valois. This feast was celebrated on 22 October as a double of the second class. Its Mass, however, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> the Blessed Virgin exclusively; it hardly mentioned St. Joseph and therefore did not correspond to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>. Also purely as a feast of Mary it appears in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, to whom it was granted 21 Aug., 1537, for 7 March (double major). About the same time the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> obtained the feast for 8 March. The Office of the Nativity of Mary was recited, changing the word <em>Nativilas</em> to <em>Desponsatio</em>. After the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, among the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> which adopted the feast of the Espousals of Mary, Arras takes the lead. It has been kept there since 23 Jan., 1556. The first proper Office was composed by Pierre Dor&eacute;, O. P. (died 1569), confessor of Duke Claude of Lorraine. This Office followed the outlines given by <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and commemorated both Joseph and Mary. Pierre Dor&eacute; in 1546 unsuccessfully petitioned <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to extend the feast of the <em>Desponsatio B. M. V.</em> to the Universal Church. But even without the recommendation of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, the feast was adopted by many Churches. In Moravia it was in the sixteenth century kept on 18. July. In subsequent times <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not favour any further extension of the feast, but after it had been refused (1655) to the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, it was granted to the German Emperor for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 27 Jan., 1678 (23. Jan.); in 1680 it was conceded to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but transferred (13 July, 1682) to 26 Nov., because in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the feast of <a href="../cathen/07649b.htm">St. Ildephonsus</a> or St. Raymond is kept 23. Jan. In 1680 it was extended to the entire <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, 1689 to the Holy Land (double, second class), 1702 to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (20 Feb.), 1720 to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and 1725 to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. In our days it is kept in nearly the entire <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> on 23 Jan., in the Spanish-speaking countries on 26 Nov., but it has never been extended to the Universal Church. Since <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> abolished the Office of Pierre Dor&eacute; and introduced the modern Office, it is again a feast of Mary. The commemoration of St. Joseph in Mass, <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> (<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> 5 May, 1736) can only be made by a special privilege.
