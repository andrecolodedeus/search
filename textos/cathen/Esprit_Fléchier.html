<h1>Esprit Fl&eacute;chier</h1>  

<p>Bishop; b. at Pernes, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1632; died at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, 1710; member of the Academy, and together with <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>, <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, and Mascaron, one of the greatest sacred orators of his century; his earliest studies were made at Tarascon, under the guidance of his uncle, who was superior of a religious congregation. He himself entered this congregation where he received holy orders, but soon left it and went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1660. It was not long before he acquired a reputation as a wit and spiritual writer. A Latin poem in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> first won for him the favour of the Court. He devoted to literature and history the leisure which remained after the fulfilment of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as tutor in the household of Caumartin. Councillor of State, and it was then he wrote his chief historical work "M&eacute;moires sur les grands jours tenus a Clermont en 1665". He was tutor to the Dauphin when his preaching began to make him famous. His funeral eulogies in particular won for him more than one comparison with <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. It happened that on a number of occasions he had to treat the same subjects as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, for instance the funeral oration of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, and to arouse almost the same sentiments of admiration.

<p>He was received a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> in 1673, on the same day as <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Racine</a>. Having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1685, he left the See of Lavaur for that of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> in 1687. During his administration he was remarkable for his great charity and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in converting <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but this did not prevent him from devoting himself to letters and to making the Academy of N&icirc;mes, of which he was the director, shine with particular brilliancy. He was less a preacher of the Gospel than a remarkable panegyrist. His sermons are as different from those of <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a> orator than a severe moralist and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> preacher. He delighted ingenious turns of phrase, sonorous words and pretentious periods which have the appearance of seeking applause and which are hardly in accord with the spirit of the Gospel. His funeral oration for Turenne is in every classical handbook. His oratorical works have been collected under the title of "Oraisons Fun&egrave;bres" (Paris, 1878), "Sermons", and "Pan&eacute;gyriques". In history he has left an "Histoire du Cardinal Xim&eacute;n&egrave;s" (Paris, 1693), the "Vie de Th&eacute;odose le Grand" and "Lettres choisies sur divers sujet". The last edition of the "Oeuvres" of Fl&eacute;chier is in two volumes (Paris, 1886).
