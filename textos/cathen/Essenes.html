<h1>Essenes</h1>  

<p>One of three leading <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> as flourishing in the second century B.C., the others being the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.

<p>Concerning their origin, history, and tenets there has been much inconclusive controversy. The only ancient authorities we have are a few paragraphs in <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo Judeaeus</a>, a somewhat lengthier description in <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, and a scanty notice in Pliny. The following synopsis is derived mainly from the first two.

<p>They are styled <em>Ess&aelig;i</em> by <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, who derives it from <em>hosios</em>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">"holy"</a>, and <em>Ess&aelig;i</em> and <em>Esseni</em> by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. Their numbers according to both authors was about 4000 and their chief place of residence along the west side, but away from the shore, of the <a href="../cathen/04658a.htm">Dead Sea</a>. They also dwelt in other, but mostly secluded, parts and small towns of Palestine; yet some were found in cities. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> arose about 150 B.C. (the first-named Essene is Judas, 110 B.C.) and disappeared towards the end of the first century A.D. They worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one God</a>, Creator and Ruler of all things, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> and omniscient. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was held in very high esteem and to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> his name meant <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The sun was held in such reverence as to awaken a suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. An all-disposing <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">Fate</a> was admitted, yet <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, apparently, was not denied. They refused to join in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> through fear of pollution, though they sent gifts thither; it seems that no blood-sacrifice was <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offered</a> by them, as they claimed that a reverent <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> was the best <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was observed with the most rigorous exactitude, not even the calls of nature being answered. Assembled in their meeting-places, where they sat according to seniority, the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a> was read and explained, generally in an allegorical manner, by some wise member. They washed frequently, as extreme importance was attached to <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">ceremonial purity</a>, and they followed scrupulously the prescriptions against levitical defilements; even for a junior to touch a senior was pollution for the latter. What their esoteric doctrines were is not known. Death was welcomed, as they held "that their bodies were corruptible, and the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> composing them is not lasting, but <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and live forever, and proceeding from the most subtle ether having been drawn into bodies as into prisons by some natural longing. But when they are set free from the bonds of flesh, then they rejoice as being freed from a long servitude and mount upwards. And agreeing with the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a> they declare that the good dwell beyond the ocean in a place which is never oppressed by snow or rainstorms or intense heat, but is always calm and refreshed by a cool breeze breathing from the ocean. To bad <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> they allot a gloomy, tempestuous cave full of never-ending torments" (Jos. Bell. Jud. I, ii, 8). Some conclude from the words just quoted that the Essenes disbelieved in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> the Essenes cultivated especially <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a>, <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">continence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>; they paid great attention to the sick, respect to the aged, and showed marked kindness and <a href="../cathen/07475c.htm">hospitality</a> to strangers. All <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were regarded as equal, and <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">slavery</a> was regarded as contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Those guilty of great crimes were punished by long exclusion or complete <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> which, since they were not allowed to eat anything prepared by outsiders, entailed always great hardship and often death. <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosophy</a> was rejected as useless and beyomd <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> capacity, but <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethics</a> was studied with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. They searched for medicinal remedies in nature, as they devoted special care to the sick irrespective of creed, and investigated the properties of minerals. They laid claim to magical powers and ability to predict. For the latter some cases are given by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, among them that of the Essene, Manahem, who foretold <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great's</a> kingship when he was a boy without any royal prospects. All things were held in common, their very houses not being their own. They laboured principally at agricultural pursuits or made farm implements or household articles, but never weapons of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which they were not allowed to carry, except a staff for defense when travelling. Harvests and wages went to the stewards, who gave as each needed. Clothes and shoes were retained until worn out. No trading was allowed except barter. Anointing with oil was considered a defilement. Servants were forbidden as tempting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Their rulers or presidents were elected, likewise their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priests</a> &#151; if they can be so called &#151; and their stewards. In towns an officer was appointed to look after travelling brethren. One-hundred members constituted a court of justice whose unanimous decision was irrevocable. The members were divided into four classes. The daily routine is given as follows: They were up before daybreak and spoke of no profane subject before the sun, and to it they addressed a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as if soliciting it to rise. Each was sent then to his appointed employment at which he worked until the fifth hour, i.e., eleven o'clock, when all assembled and having bathed in water specially <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcised</a>, and clothed themselves in white, they entered the common dining room quietly and silently. Before each of them was placed some bread and a dish of one sort of food. A <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priest</a> said <a href="../cathen/06714b.htm">grace</a> and then, but not before, they might eat. At the end of the repast <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was again said, their white garments laid aside, and resuming their ordinary attire they worked until evening, when the supped in the same manner. At the noonday meal, which was regarded apparently as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificial</a> feast, being prepared by their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priests</a>, no stranger was admitted, but at supper it was otherwise. As they spoke only in turn and observed great moderation in food and drink, the <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a> at the meals appeared to outsiders, so we are told, something very solemn and mysterious. Many of the Essenes reached a great age and they acquired such <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of mind and body that the worst torments inflicted on them by the Romans failed to shake their constancy and they met death with a smile.

<p>Most of the Essenes rejected <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a>, not on account of any wrong in it but because they did not trust <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and desired peace and harmony. They perpetuated their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> by <a href="../cathen/01147a.htm">adopting</a> children and admitting adults who were "wearying of battling with the rough sea of life", as Pliny says. At their coming they received an apron to wear at their ablutions, a white garment, and a little spade-like instrument with which to dig a hole and cover their excrement from the rays of the sun. For one year their <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> was tested by observing outside the community its <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> rules. Then came a fresh trial of two years, during which they shared in the lustral rites, but not in the meals, of the initiated. If found satisfactory they were chosen full members and bound themselves to fearful <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> to honour <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, observe justice, to be loyal to all, but especially to those in authority, and if ever in authority themselves not to outshine others by dress, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and honesty, to conceal nothing from their fellows, and to reveal nothing to strangers, also to keep secret at all costs their books and the names of their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This was the only time when Essenes took <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, their word being regarded by all as so sacred that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> excused them from the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance. Some of them observed the same rules yet <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">married</a>, but merely for the order's sake, and only after three year's probation and if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> appeared healthy and likely to bear children.

<p>The Essenes have received attention during the last three centuries out of all proportion to their numbers, their influence upon contemporary life, or their importance as factors in religious development. This sprang from two causes, one external and the other internal. The latter was the curious mixture of Jewish and foreign elements in their tenets and customs. This peculiarity aroused the curiosity and exercised the ingenuity of the learned to account for the combination. That the Essenes were really <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, though speaking very likely Greek (<a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Jews</a> by <em>race</em>, says <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>), is admitted. Their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, reverence for one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, strict observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, fanatic adherence to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> (<a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>), etc., all show this; while their attitude toward the sun, election of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priests</a>, mode of life, likened to the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> himself, etc., seemed to show outside influence. The source of this influence, like everything Essenic, begets controversy, but so far no one has succeeded in determining it satisfactorily. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11508b.htm">Parseeism</a>, <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreanism</a> (old, new, and Orphic) Hellenism, etc., have all had their claims put forth as one of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of this hybrid <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. Suffice it to say that <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>-<a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> influence through the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">Captivity</a>, and Hellenism filtering in through <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and the use of the Greek tongue can amply account for foreign elements. The contention that their elements, if divested of their Greek appearance, could be proved top have their roots in <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> ground is not lightly to be set aside. The external cause of attention was the bias of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">deists</a> and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Continental</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> who strove to metamorphize the Essenes into predecessors from whom gradually and quite naturally <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> developed; and <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> pretended to find in Essenism pure <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In reference to such chimeras it is enough to say that between Essenism and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there are some points of resemblance; it could not very well be otherwise because Essenism was <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaic</a> in its foundation and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was not destructive but progressive. On the other hand, the differences are fundamental. That <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were Essenes are mere assumptions based on similarities which spring naturally and independently from <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> and voluntary <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>. So likewise the vaunted dependence between Essenism and <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monasticism</a> can be resolved into necessary traits of any <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a>, <a href="../cathen/04179a.htm">communistic</a> life (see "Wuku" in "Studien u. Mittheilungen d. Ben. Cist. ordens", 1890, I 223-30; Berli&egrave;re in "Revue B&eacute;n&eacute;d", 1891, VIII, 12-190). "The attitude of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> is altogether anti-Essenic" (Jewish Encyc.). The strict silence about any <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> is due partly perhaps to the secrecy of the Essenes and mainly no doubt to His rejection by their chronicler, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. In fine, our present <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Essenes is slight and not at all trustworthy, as its sources as scanty, coloured, and unreliable.
