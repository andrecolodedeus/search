<h1>Ethelbert, Archbishop of York</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; d. 8 Nov., 781 or 782. The name also appears as ALBERT, ADALBERHT, &AElig;LBERHT, ALDBERHT, ALUBERHT, EADBERHT and ELCHBERT. He was the teacher and intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, whose poem on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of York, "De Sanctis et Pontificibus Ecclesi&aelig; Eboracensis", is the principal source of information concerning Ethelbert's life. He was a kinsman of his predecessor Archbishop Egbert (brother to Eadberht, King of Northumbria) and a pupil in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which Egbert founded at York. When he reached man's estate, Egbert <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and made him master of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Among his pupils were <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, who has left us an affectionate description of him, from which we learn how varied his erudition was grammar, rhetoric, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, poetry, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, natural history, and <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> being all mentioned as subjects in which he instructed his pupils. He is described as severe to the stubborn, gentle to the docile, while of those who were scholars after his own heart it is said "Hos sibi conjunxit, docuit, nutrivit, amavit". His ready sympathy won the affection of his students, while his strenuous energy urged them on to further progress. Even after Egbert became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, he reserved to himself the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of lecturing on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, while he entrusted the work of explaining the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to Ethelbert. As a keen scholar he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> books ardently and spared no pains in forming a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, which was probably the largest collection of books to be found outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, in enumerating many of these, mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors, as well as the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers. Ethelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> among other places. Everywhere his learning and power of sympathy won for him friends, so that his influence for good was widespread and he ranks as one of the foremost among the promoters of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the eighth century.

<p>In 766 Archbishop Egbert died, and Ethelbert was unanimously chosen to succeed him. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 April, 767, and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> in 773. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he continued his simple and laborious life, working with such success that he is regarded as one of the founders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of York. He set himself to rebuild the minster which had been destroyed by fire in 741. It is impossible to obtain certain information as to the extent of his work, but <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> speaks as though he began, finished, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it:

<blockquote><p>Ast nova basilic&aelig; mir&aelig; structura diebus <br>Pr&aelig;sulis hujus erat jam coepta, peracta, sacrata.</p></blockquote>

<p>He speaks of its magnificence, the columns and <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypts</a>, bright <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">windows</a> and ceilings, the tall crucifix of precious metals, the thirty <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altars</a> it contained, and the gold, silver, and jewels employed in the decoration of <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and altars. Eanbald and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> were employed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to superintend its construction. From York Ethelbert developed both missionary work and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> effort. He sent out from his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> both preachers and teachers, the latter of whom founded new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> while the former spread the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. Thus we find Ethelbert holding a council in Northumbria at which it was decided to send <a href="../cathen/15628a.htm">Willehad</a> as a missionary to the Frisians and Saxons. From the York <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, too, came Alubert and Liudger, the Apostles of North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 780 Ethelbert, desiring to <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">prepare for death</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Eanbald as his coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and committed to <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> the care of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. He then retired to a cell where he spent some time in devotion. Shortly before his death, in the autumn of 781 or 782, he appeared once more in public that he might <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which was now complete. Ten days later he died and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in his church at York. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> mourned his loss as that of a father, and composed in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the splendid panegyric (lines 1394-1595) which is the gem of the poem of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of York. To him Ethelbert &mdash; or Aelbert, as he calls him &mdash; was both pontiff and saint, "Jam cui Christus amor, potus, cibus, omnia Christus".
