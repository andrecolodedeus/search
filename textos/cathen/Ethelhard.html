<h1>Ethelhard</h1>  

<p>(&AElig;THELHEARD, ETHELREARD)

<p>The fourteenth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 12 May, 805. Much obscurity surrounds the details of his life previous to his election. He is described by Symeon of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> as "Abbas Hludensis Monasterii", but it is uncertain what <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is thus designated. It has been variously located at Louth in Lincolnshire (the most probable identification), Lydd, and Luddersdown in Kent, and at <a href="../cathen/09572c.htm">Malmesbury</a>. <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> is certainly mistaken in identifying him with Ethelhard, ninth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>.

<p>The rise of <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa, King of the Mercians</a> (757-796), had divided <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> into three great states: Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex. The king sought to consolidate his kingdom by giving it an independent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization; for although Northumbria had its own <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Mercia, after conquering Kent, was still ecclesiastically subject to the powerful see of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, then ruled over by <a href="../cathen/08267b.htm">Jaenbert</a> (766-791). <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa's</a> scheme was to weaken Canterbury's influence by dividing the southern province, and creating a Mercian <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> at <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>: this he successfully accomplished when on the occasion of the Legatine visit of George and Theophylact, sent by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Hadrian I</a> (772-795) in 786-788, Higbert received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, and Canterbury was left with only <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, Sherborne, Rochester, and Selsey as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. On the death of <a href="../cathen/08267b.htm">Jaenbert</a> (12 Aug., 791), Ethelhard was raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> through the influence of <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a>, which makes it likely that he was a Mercian <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Although he was elected in 791, his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> only took place on 21 July, 793: the delay being probably due to the unwillingness of the Kentish <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people to receive a Mercian <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and to his being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>. Had <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa's</a> policy of separate <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization prevailed, it would have impeded the attainment of national unity, and its defeat by Ethelhard is an event of the greatest importance in the history of the making of the English nation. During <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa's</a> lifetime little could be done to restore Canterbury's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and prestige. The year 796 was full of incident: the nobles of Kent rose in arms, and rallying round Eadbert Praen, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> and a member of their royal house, endeavoured to shake off the yoke of the Mercian <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a>. As Ethelhard's difficulties increased <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> exhorted him not to <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> his Church; but after taking severe <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> measures against the recalcitrant cleric he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee. <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a> died on 26 July. His successor Egfrith died after a very short reign, about 13 Dec.; Cenwulf succeeded in Mercia, but the struggle continued in Kent until the capture of Eadbert in 798.

<p>The co-operation of Ethelhard and Cenwulf in deposing Eadbert, and in upholding the Mercian cause in Kent, increased the importance of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> authority of Higbert waned. Cenwulf restored an estate taken from <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> by <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a>, and wrote in 798 to Pope Leo asking him to examine into the question of the diminution of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of that see, and enclosing a letter from Ethelhard and his suffragans. Ethelhard meanwhile had returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> wrote exhorting him to do penance for having deserted it. The success of Abbot Wada's mission to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the tone of the letter of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> to Cenwulf, and the successful conference with Eanbald II of York, with reference to the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, determined Ethelhard to set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 801. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> friendship once more stood him in good stead; he sent a servant to meet him at St. Josse-sur-mer, and furnished him with letters of recommendation to Charles the Great. Success attended his efforts in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a> (795-816) granted his request, and ended the dispute between Canterbury and Lichfield by depriving Lichfield of its recently acquired honours and powers. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> decision was officially acknowledged by the Council of Clovesho on 12 Oct., 803, in presence of Cenwulf and his Witan, and Higbert was deprived of his <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, in spite of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> plea that so good a man should be spared that humiliation.

<p>It is during Ethelhard's occupancy of the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> that we first meet with official records of the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and obedience made by the English bishops-elect to their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The first document of that type is the profession of obedience to the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> made in 796 by Bishop Eadulf of Linsey, who, as a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, ought to have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Higbert: it would appear to coincide with the collapse of Higbert's <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> authority at the death of <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a>.
