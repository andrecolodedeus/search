<h1>Etienne-Antoine Boulogne</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 26 December 1747; d. at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, 13 March, 1825. He was the son of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and obtained an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> of his native city. He exhibited talent and industry and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1771. His oratorical gifts attracted general attention, and he soon became one of the most admired preachers in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. For a while the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a> him from preaching; but was eventually induced to withdraw his opposition when a eulogy composed by the Abb&eacute; Boulogne on the late Dauphin, the father of Louis XVI, obtained a prize. The Abb&eacute;'s reputation as a preacher now grew steadily. He preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons <em>aux Quinze-Vingts</em> in 1786, and at the court of <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> in 1787. In one of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> at court he clearly pointed out the fearful storm which was threatening <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, brought on by the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> philosophy and irreligion of the day. The storm advanced unchecked and broke over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> sooner and with greater <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> than had been foreseen, except by the keenest observers. Boulogne refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the civil constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> demanded by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and was in consequence stripped of his titles and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. He also refused to leave his country in her need. He was arrested three times, but each time succeeded in recovering his liberty; condemned to deportation on another occasion for having defended <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against the attacks of Larevelli&egrave;re L&eacute;peaux, he again evaded the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. The worst of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> storm had scarcely blown over when he reappeared, contending in the "Annales Catholiques", of which he had become the sole editor, with unbelievers and those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who had taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the civil constitution. In spite of incessant and fierce opposition he published this magazine under one title or another until the year 1807. He also resumed his labours as preacher with greater authority and success than ever. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, always in search of men of talent who were capable of furthering his ambitious designs, first appointed the Abb&eacute; Boulogne his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>. The Abb&eacute; foresaw clearly that his position would be one of great difficulty; but already schooled to adversity, he did not shrink from the new trails which awaited him.

<p>In 1811 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> summoned to a council to be held at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Bishop Boulogne preached the opening sermon in the church of Notre Dame. "Whatever vicissitudes", he said in conclusion, "the See of Peter may experience, whatever be the state and condition of his august successor, we shall firmly cling to him with bonds of filial respect and reverence; the See may be displaced, it cannot be destroyed; wherever that See may be, the others will take their stand around it; whithersoever that the See moves, thither all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> will follow; for there alone is the last link of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> succession; there the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> government; there, the deposit of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>." It is easy to see how distasteful these <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> words, which produced a profound impression on the assembly, must have been to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> who, at this very time, was holding <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in captivity away from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was using his wonted <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and deception to extort from the assembled <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> a decision that would enable him to do without <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> investiture for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his choice. Yet this displeasure did not prevent the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from choosing the preacher as secretary of the council and member of the committee on the reply to the imperial message. When this committee reported that there was no authority in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that could supply, even provisionally and for a case of necessity, the absence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of episcopal investiture, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> dissolved the council and that very night Bishop Boulogne was arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. He was not restored to his flock before the events of 1814. During the first Bourbon Restoration, he was chosen to preach the funeral oration of Louis XVI, and, at the second, he preached, 6 January, 1816, his well-known sermon "La France veut son Dieu, la France veut son roi", Louis XVIII made him peer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> granted him the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> bestowing on him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. Up to the last he exercised the ministry of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with remarkable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and talent. His writings, literary, historical, and apologetic, disclose unusual soundness and strength of mind.
