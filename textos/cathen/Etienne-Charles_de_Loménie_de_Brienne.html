<h1>Etienne-Charles de Lom&eacute;nie de Brienne</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and statesman; b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1727; d. at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, 1794. He was of noble lineage, studied at the Coll&egrave;ge d'Harcourt and then at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, where, in spite of certain suggestions of unorthodoxy, he was given the doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1752, he became successively <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1752), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Condom (1760), and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1762). Forced by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> upon Louis XVI, who feared his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and despised his private life, he was made in 1788 <em>ministre principal</em> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, the second richest see in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As a minister, he was popular with the Assembly of the Notables, but failed to win the Parlement over to his financial schemes, and fell after announcing the convocation of the States General for 1 May 1789. In order to offset his downfall, he succeeded by clever intrigue in gaining for himself the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, and in having his nephew, Martial de Lom&eacute;nie, appointed coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. The influence and wealth attached to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> he used to have Sens made the seat of the new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> department of Yonne &#151; instead of Auxerre, the natural <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. Having taken the constitutional <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> on 30 January 1791, he drew after him a large portion of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, submitted to popular election, and, being returned both in <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Sens, chose the latter place because of its being near the French capital.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 23 February 1791, severely rebuked him for his disloyalty, he replied by renouncing the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, and was formally deposed at the <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a> of 26 September 1791. He then retired with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to St.-Pierre-le-Vif, a confiscated <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> which he had purchased from the spoliators and shamefully <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, and there awaited events. Owing to his nobility, wealth, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank, he was naturally made the object of denunciations. For a time his prodigality in bribing the local authorities saved him from harm. On 15 November 1793, when the Convention was at its fiercest, and denunciations meant imminent danger, he <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> for safety's sake, but was nevertheless arrested on 18 February 1794. The following day he was found dead in his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> &#151; some say from <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>, and some from a stroke of apoplexy. His nephew and former coadjutor, Martial de Lom&eacute;nie, who had also <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, was sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> on 10 May 1794, but the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">Christian fortitude</a> of Madame Elisabeth and the warm exhortations of the dean of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, both of whom were in the same van with him, softened his heart, and he died repentant. Lom&eacute;nie de Brienne was a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>. The "Canal de Brienne," which connects the river Garonne with the Canal du Midi, is called after him. He wrote the "Oraison fun&egrave;bre du Dauphin" (Paris, 1776), "Compte rendu au Roi" (Paris, 1788), and, in collaboration with Turgot, "Le Conciliateur" (Paris, 1754).
