<h1>Etienne Baluze</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> scholar and historian, b. at <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Tulle</a>, 24 December, 1630; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 28 July, 1718. His <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was commenced at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of his native town, where he distinguished himself by his intelligence, his constant devotion to study, and his prodigious memory. Obtaining a scholarship on the recommendation of his professors, he completed his classical courses at the College of St. Martial, which had been founded at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in the fourteenth century, by <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Pope Innocent VI</a> for twenty Limousin students. Resolved to devote himself to the study of literature and history, Baluze set to work with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, perseverance, and success. Critical and painstaking in the investigation of facts, he undertook to study the origins of the French nation, its customs, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and institutions, using for this purpose only genuine documents and original records instead of fanciful legends and fabulous stories, thus introducing a scientific spirit into historical research, philology, and <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>.

<p>At the age of twenty-two he wrote a remarkable work of historical criticism. A <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Frizon, had just published a book, "Gallia purpurata", containing the lives of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, which met with great success until Baluze gave out (1652) his "Anti-Frizonius" in which he pointed out and corrected many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> made by Father Frizon. In 1654, Pierre de Marca, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, one of the greatest French scholars in the seventeenth century, appointed Baluze his secretary. Upon the death of his patron, in June, 1662, Baluze published the "Marca Hispanica", a remarkable historical and geographical description of <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>. This work made him known to <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert</a>, who appointed him his librarian, a position he held for thirty years, many years, that is, after <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert's</a> death. The excellent collection of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and books which was found in the latter's <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was the fruit of his care and advice. His own collection was also very important; it comprised about 1100 printed books, 957 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, more than 500 charters, and seven cases full of various documents. Baluze is to be ranked among those benefactors of literature who have employed their time and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in collecting form all sources ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, valuable books, and state papers. He annotated them with valuable comments, being very well acquainted with profane and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> as well as with canon law, both ancient and modern.

<p>The number of works Baluze published is considerable; we shall mention the most important among them: (1) "Marii Mercatoris opera" (1684), collated with <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and enriched with notes illustrative of the history of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. (2) "Regum Francorum capitularia" (1677). This collection contains several capitularies never published before. Baluze corrected them with great accuracy and in his preface gave an account of the original documents and of the authority of the several collections of the capitularies. (3) "Epistolae Innocentii Papae III" (1682); not a complete collection, as Baluze was refused the use of the letters preserved in the Vatican. (4) "Conciliorum nova collectio" (1683), containing such pieces as are wanting in Labbe's collection. (5) "Les vies des papes d'Avignon" (1693), in which he gave a preference to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> over <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the seat of the Popes. (6) "Miscellanea" (1680), of which Mansi published a new edition in 1761. (7) "Historia Tutelensis" (1717), or the history of <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Tulle</a>. This was Baluze's favourite work. He wrote it out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his native place, "ne in nostr&acirc; patri&acirc; peregrini atque hospites esse videamur". It embraces a period of eight centuries, from the founding of the city (900), to the episcopate of Daniel de Saint-Aulaire (1702). The history of <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Tulle</a> is divided into three books, the first dealing with the counts, the second with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and the third with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>In 1670, Baluze was appointed professor of canon law at the Coll&egrave;ge de France, of which he became director in 1707, with a pension awarded by the king. But he soon felt the uncertainty of courtly favours. Having attached himself to <a href="../cathen/02711d.htm">Cardinal de Bouillon</a>, who had engaged him to write the history of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he became involved in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> disgrace. Baluze was accused of having used spurious papers in his patron's interest. Consequently he received a <em>lettre de cachet</em> ordering him to retire to Lyons. Being expelled from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and deprived of his personal fortune, he wandered from <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> to <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, from <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> to <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and later to <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, where he lived until 1713. After the peace of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/02711d.htm">Cardinal de Bouillon</a> recovered the favour of the king, and Baluze was recalled, but never again employed as a professor or as a Director of the Coll&egrave;ge de France. He lived far from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was engaged in publishing <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> works at the time of his death. Baluze, together with Luc d'Ach&eacute;ry, <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, Sainte-Marthe, <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Ducange</a>, Montfaucon, and others, gathered an immense quantity of rich materials which the historians of the nineteenth century, such as Sismondi, Guizot, Augustin and Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Thierry, Michelet, Henri Martin, Fustel de Coulanges, were to use with the greatest skill.
