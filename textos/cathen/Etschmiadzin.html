<h1>Etschmiadzin</h1>  

<p>A famous <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, since 1441 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> capital of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and seat of their patriarch or <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, whom the greater part of the Non-Uniat <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church acknowledge as their head. It is situated in Russian territory, in the extreme south of the Caucasus, on the River Aras near the city of Erivan. As early as the fifth or sixth century, if not earlier, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> existed there attached to the royal residence of Valarshapat, itself the immemorial national centre of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. According to national tradition, more or less reliable, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> was founded here by Saint <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">Gregory Illuminator</a>, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, early in the fourth century. On the site of his famous vision of "the descent of the only Begotten One" (Descendit Unigenitus = in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, Etschmiadzin), the anniversary of which is still kept as a national feast, he built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and in time a splendid church and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> arose there, around which centred the national and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> until the middle of the fifth century, when, owing first to the invasions of Caucasian hordes and then to Persian <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, there began the long series of wanderings that recall the story of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> with <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> body. During these centuries both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people valued most highly the right arm of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a>; its possessor was practically considered the legitimate patriarch. After many removals, first to Dowin (Duin, Tvin) and then to other places, the patriarchal see was eventually located in the city of Sis, in Cilicia (Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>), where it remained from 1293 to 1441; at the former date the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was said to have been <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> brought to Sis from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, whither it had been taken by the Mamelukes. When the small <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principality of Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, long upheld by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> (1097-1375), was at last destroyed, the national and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of its people naturally turned again towards the earlier venerable centre, in Northern or Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. After the death, at Sis (1440), of Patriarch Joseph II, irregularities occurred in the election of the new patriarch, Gregory Musapekian, which northern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were willing to overlook if he would transfer his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. On his refusal a new election was held at Etschmiadzin where, it is said, about seven hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and archpriests (<em>vartapeds</em>) assembled and elected Kirakos Virabetzi, with whom begins the series of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Etschmiadzin. By some stratagem the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is said to have secured from Sis the possession of the famous <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. A patriarchal succession, however, was, and is still, maintained at Sis, where what purport to be the selfsame <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are shown and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. There are, moreover, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> (schismatic) <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> at Aghtamar, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1311) and Constantinople (1461), the latter for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>, also an independent <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Etschmiadzin, Stephen V (1541), Michael of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> (1564), David IV (1587), Melchisedek (1593), Moses (1629), Philibos (1633), Agbob IV (1655), and others, took steps towards reunion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and some made profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> before death. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> finally abandoned Etschmiadzin as their religious centre, and obtained a <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, first at <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a> (1742), later at Constantinople (1830-667). The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> subject to Etschmiadzin underwent bitter <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> when Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> passed into the power of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; even the right hand of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a> and other prized <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and images of the national apostle, and of King Tiridates and St. Rhipsime, were carried away (1604) to the Persian capital; these were finally restored to Etschmiadzin in 1638. Since 1828 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and its district have passed into Russian hands, whereby the independence of the patriarch has been naturally diminished. He is not, however, subject to the Holy Synod of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, but presides over his own holy synod of seven members. In 1836 the Russian Government issued an official constitution for the administration of the Gregorian (i.e. <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>) Church in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. It comprises 141 articles regulating the election of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and the ruling of Gregorian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In 1882 non-Russian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> refused to recognize the Russian <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> to Etschmiadzin, but in 1884 they yielded. Thus a Russian <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functionary residing at Etschmiadzin is, in theory, the "Supreme Patriarch and <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>". Even in fact, the great majority of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> acknowledge his authority; only a small minority adhere to Sis, Aghtamar, Constantinople, and <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> is subject to Etschmiadzin, and has as quasi-suffragans the Vartapeds of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the Vartaped of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> is subject to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Since Kirakos Virapetzi (1441) some thirty-eight successors have ruled at Etschmiadzin, not however without numerous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> are often assisted by a coadjutor, or rather co-titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose name sometimes <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> gets inserted in the list of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> proper. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Etschmiadzin alone consecrates the <em>myron</em> (chrism) and also the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. His curia is formed by (a) a patriarchal synod (two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, five archpriests); (b) a board of administration (one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, two archpriests); (c) an editorial committee (two archpriests and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>). The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> consists of about twenty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; since 1874 a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has been maintained for the training of the higher <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Though prominent in a hierarchical sense, as a centre of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> literary and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> activity Etschmiadzin ranks far behind <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and Constantinople (see M<font size=-2>ECHITARISTS</font>, though of late some life and energy are evident. Etschmiadzin is richly endowed. Externally it resembles a great fortress; within its walls are the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> proper, the magnificent church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and six <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, one of them said to stand on the site of the apparition of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. Outside the walls are several churches, among them three dedicated to the earliest <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, St. Rhipsime and her companions and St. Gaiane, hence the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> name &#220;tsch Kilisse (Three Churches). The numerous buildings either restored or rebuilt, date mostly from the last three centuries, and make an imposing appearance.
