<h1>Eucharist</h1>  

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">EUCHARIST AS SACRIFICE</a>, <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">EUCHARIST AS SACRAMENT</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">REAL PRESENCE</a>.

<p>(Greek <em>eucharistia</em>, thanksgiving).

<p>The name given to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> of the Altar in its twofold aspect of <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">sacrament</a> and <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of Mass</a>, and in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">truly present</a> under the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>.

<p>Other titles are used, such as "Lord's Supper" (<em>Coena Domini</em>), "Table of the Lord" (<em>Mensa Domini</em>), the "Lord's Body" (<em>Corpus Domini</em>), and the "Holy of Holies" (<em>Sanctissimum</em>), to which may be added the following expressions, and somewhat altered from their primitive meaning: "Agape" (Love-Feast), <a href="../cathen/05603b.htm">"Eulogia"</a> (Blessing), "Breaking of Bread", <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">"Synaxis"</a> (Assembly), etc.; but the ancient title "Eucharistia" appearing in writers as early as Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, and Iren&aelig;us, has taken precedence in the technical terminology of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. The expression "Blessed Sacrament of the Altar", introduced by Augustine, is at the present day almost entirely restricted to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> and popular treatises.

<p>This extensive nomenclature, describing the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> from such different points of view, is in itself sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the central position the Eucharist has occupied from the earliest ages, both in the <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Divine worship</a> and services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in the life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion which animates her members.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> the Eucharist as one of her most exalted <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, since for sublimity and incomprehensibility it yields in nothing to the allied <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. These three mysteries constitute a wonderful triad, which causes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> characteristic of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, as a religion of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> far transcending the capabilities of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, to shine forth in all its brilliance and splendor, and elevates <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, the most faithful guardian and keeper of our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heritage, far above all <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and non-Christian <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>.

<p>The organic connection of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> triad is clearly discerned, if we consider <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> under the aspect of a personal communication of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, God the Father, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> generation, communicates His Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> to <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a>, "the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> who is in the bosom of the Father" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs18">John 1:18</a>), while the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, communicates in turn the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> received from His Father to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> formed in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs14">John 1:14</a>), in order that thus as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-man</a>, hidden under the Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">Species</a>, He might deliver Himself to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who, as a tender mother, mystically cares for and nurtures in her own bosom this, her greatest treasure, and daily places it before her children as the spiritual food of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Thus the Trinity, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and Eucharist are really welded together like a precious chain, which in a wonderful manner links <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with earth, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, uniting them most intimately and keeping them thus united. By the very fact that the Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> does transcend <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, no <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> explanation of it, based on a merely natural hypothesis and seeking to comprehend one of the sublimest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> as the spontaneous conclusion of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> processes, may be attempted by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>.

<p>The modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of comparative <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> is striving, wherever it can, to discover in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> "religio-historical parallels", corresponding to the theoretical and practical elements of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and thus by means of the former to give a natural explanation of the latter. Even were an <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> discernible between the Eucharistic repast and the ambrosia and nectar of the ancient Greek gods, or the <em>haoma</em> of the Iranians, or the <em>soma</em> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, we should nevertheless be very cautious not to stretch a mere <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> to a parallelism strictly so called, since the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Eucharist has nothing at all in common with these <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> foods, whose origin is to be found in the crassest idol- and nature-worship. What we do particularly discover is a new <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the reasonableness of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, from the circumstance that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in a wonderfully condescending manner responds to the natural craving of the human heart after a food which nourishes unto <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, a craving expressed in many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, by dispensing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> His own Flesh and Blood. All that is beautiful, all that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of nature, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has appropriated to itself, and like a concave mirror has collected the dispersed and not infrequently distorted rays of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into their common focus and again sent them forth resplendently in perfect beams of light.

<p>It is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, "the pillar and ground of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>", imbued with and directed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that guarantees to her children through her <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching the full and unadulterated <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation of God</a>. Consequently, it is the first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to adhere to what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proposes as the "proximate norm of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<em>regula fidei proxima</em>), which, in reference to the Eucharist, is set forth in a particularly clear and detailed manner in Sessions XIII, XXI, and XXII of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<p>The quintessence of these <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions consists in this, that <em>in the Eucharist the Body and Blood of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-man</a> are truly, <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really</a>, and substantially present for the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">nourishment of our souls</a>, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> into the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that in this change of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> the unbloody <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the New Testament</a> is also contained.</em>

<p>These three principle <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> &#151; are given a more detailed consideration in the following articles: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">The Sacrifice of the Mass</a> <li><a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">The Eucharist as a Sacrament</a> <li><a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">The Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a> </ul>
