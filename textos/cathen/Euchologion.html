<h1>Euchologion</h1>  

<p>The name of one of the chief Service-books of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>; it corresponds more or less to our <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and Ritual. The Euchologion contains first, directions for the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the <em>Hesperinon</em> (<a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>), <em>Orthros</em> (<a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>), and Liturgy. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> for those two hours follow; Then come the Liturgies; first, <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> for the holy Liturgy in general, and a long note about the arrangement of the breads at the Proskomide. The Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> is the frame into which the others are fitted. The Euchologion contains only the parts of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at full length, first for the Chrysostom-liturgy, then for those parts of <a href="../cathen/02321a.htm">St. Basil's Liturgy</a> that differ from it, then for the Presanctified-Liturgy, beginning with the Hesperinon that always precedes it; After the Liturgies follow a collection of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> with various rules, canons, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. First the rite of churching the mother after child-birth (<em>euchai eis gynaika lecho</em>), adapted for various conditions, then certain "canons of the Apostles and Fathers" about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said over <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, the rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, followed by the washing (<em>apolousis</em>) of the child, seven days later, certain <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> of St. Basil and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, and the rite of consecrating <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> (<em>myron</em>) on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>. Then follow the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> services for <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (there is a second rite of ordaining <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "according to the exposition of the most holy Lord Metrophanes, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11172c.htm">Nyssa</a>"), the blessing of a hegumenos (<a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>) and of other superiors of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for those who begin to serve in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the rites for <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> (reader, singer, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>).

<p>The ceremonies for receiving <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, clothing <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the mandyas (the "little habit") and in the "great and angelic habit" come next, the appointing of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be confessor (<em>pneumatikos</em>) and the manner of hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said over <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who take a solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, for those who incur canonical punishments, and for those who are absolved from them. Then comes a collection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for various necessities. A long <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> for "forgiveness of sins", written by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Euthymius, follows, and we come to the rites of espousal, marriage (called the "crowning", <em>Stephanoma</em>, from the most striking feature of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for taking off the crowns eight days later, the rite of second marriages (called, as by us, "bigamy", <em>digamia</em>, in which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>), and the very long unction of the sick (<em>to hagion elaion</em>), performed normally by seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Next, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> for new churches and antiminsia (the corporal containing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> they use for the Liturgy; it is really a kind of <a href="../cathen/01348b.htm">portable altar</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of washing the altar on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, erection of a Stauropegion (exempt <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>), the short blessing of waters (<em>hagiasmos</em>), and the great one (used on the Epiphany) followed by a sacramental which consists of bathing (<em>nipter</em>) afterwards. After one or two more ceremonies, such as a curious rite of kneeling (<em>gonyklisis</em>, otherwise a rare gesture in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>) on the evening of <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a>, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the sick and dying, come the burial services for <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Then follows a very miscellaneous collection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> (marked <em>euchai diaphoroi</em>), canons of penance, against earthquakes, for time of pestilence, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and two addressed to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. More <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for various occasions end the book; In modern Euchologia, however, it is usual to add the "Apostles" (the Epistles) and Gospels for the chief feasts (these are taken from the two books that contain the whole collection of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> lessons), and lastly the arrangement of the court of the &oelig;cumenical patriarch in choir, with <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> directions for their various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> during the Liturgy. This last chapter is found, of course, only in the Orthodox book.

<p>It will be seen, then, that the Euchologion is the handbook for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; It contains only the short responses of the choir, who have to use their own choir-books (Triodion, Pentekostarion, Oktoechos, Parakletike, <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menologion</a>). The Euchologion, in common with all Byzantine service-books, suffers from an amazing want of order. One discerns a certain fundamental system in the order of its chief parts; but the shorter services, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, etc. are thrown together pell-mell.

<p>The first printed edition was published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1526; The Orthodox official edition in Greek is printed (as are all their books) at the Phoenix press (<em>typographeion ho Phoinix</em>) at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (7th ed., edited by Spiridion Zerbos, 1898). There is also an Athenian edition and one of Constantinople. The Churches that use other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages have presses (generally at the capital of the country, St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/03045a.htm">Bukarest</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) for their translations. Provost Alexios Maltzew of the Russian Embassy Church at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> has edited the Euchologion in Old Slavonic and German with notes (Vienna, 1861, reprinted at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1892). Uniats use the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> edition and have a compendium (<em>mikron euchologion</em>) containing only the Liturgies, Apostles and Gospels, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, marriage, unction, and confession (Rome, 1872). J. Goar, O.P., edited the Euchologion with very complete notes, explanations, and illustrations (Euchologion, sive Rituale Gr&aelig;corum, 2nd ed., Venice, fol., 1720); this is still the standard work of reference for Byzantine rites.
