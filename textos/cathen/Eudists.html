<h1>Eudists</h1>  

<p>(Society of Jesus and Mary)

<p>An <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> instituted at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 25 March, 1643, by the Venerable Jean Eudes. The principal works of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and the giving of missions. The end which Father Eudes assigned to his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> made him decide not to introduce religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. He was persuaded that, better than religious, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, finding in the very dignity with which they were invested the reason and means of rising to eminent perfection, were in a position to inspire young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> with a high <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which it required. He also felt that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would not so willingly give their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> over to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were not entirely subject to them. Father Eudes shared the opinions of <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle</a> and Father <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, who did not think it proper to admit religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in the orders which they founded. Even <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> did so only after great hesitation and on the condition, ratified by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, that the Priests of the Mission should not form a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, properly so called, but an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>.

<p>The Society of Jesus and Mary is not, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, but an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> body under the immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to aid in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It is composed of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> who are admitted after a probation of three years and three months. There are also <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> employed in temporal affairs, but who do not wear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> habit. To develop the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the members of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, Father Eudes caused to be celebrated every year in his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> the feast of the Holy Priesthood of Jesus Christ and of all Holy Priests and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>. After the feast of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary it is one of the principal in the community. The solemnity begins on 13 November and is celebrated with an octave. It thus serves as a preparation for the renewal of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> promises on 21 November, the feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin. As early as 1649 Father Eudes had prepared an Office proper to the feast. Some years later the feast and office were adopted by the Sulpician Fathers. Although not a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, the Society of Jesus and Mary is subject to discipline which does not differ from that of orders with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The administration is modelled on that of the Oratory to which Father Eudes had belonged for twenty years. The supreme authority resides in a general assembly which names the superior general and which is called, at intervals, to control his administration. It alone can make permanent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In the intervals between the general assemblies, the superior general, named for life, exercises full authority in matters spiritual and temporal; He has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to name and depose local superiors, to fix the personnel of each house, to make the annual visit, to admit, and, in case of necessity, to dismiss, subjects, to accept or to give up foundations, and, in general, to perform, or at least to authorize, all important acts. He is aided by assistants, named by the general assembly, who have a deciding vote in temporal affairs, and a consulting vote only in other questions.

<p>During the lifetime of Father Eudes, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> (1643), Coutances (1650), Lisieux (1653), Rouen (1658), Evreux (1667), and Rennes (1670). These were all "grand" <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>; Father Eudes never thought of founding any other. He admitted, however, besides <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> Students, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with newly granted <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> who came for further study, those who wished to make retreats, and even lay students who followed the courses of the Faculty of Theology. After his death directors were appointed for the Seminaries of Valognes, Avranches, Dol, Senlis, <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, Domfront, and <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>. At Rennes, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and some other cities <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were conducted for students of a poorer class who were called to exercise the ministry in country places. These were sometimes called "little" <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> were admitted early and made both their profane and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, three Eudists, Fathers H&eacute;bert, Potier, and Lefranc, perished at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the massacres of September, 1792. The cause of their <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> with that of some other victims of September has been introduced in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Father H&eacute;bert was the confessor of King Louis XVI, and shortly before his death he made the king promise to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his kingdom to the Sacred Heart if he escaped from his enemies. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> had great difficulty in establishing itself again, and it was only in the second half of the nineteenth century that it began to prosper. Too late to take over again the direction of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> formerly theirs, the Eudists entered upon missionary work and secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in colleges. The "Law of Associations" (1906) brought about the ruin of the establishments which they had in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Besides the scholasticates which they have opened in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, they direct <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at Carthagena, at Antioquia, at <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pamplona</a>, at Panam&aacute; (South America), and at <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>, West Indies. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> they have the Vicariate Apostolic of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, N. S., a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Church Point, N. S., and at Caraquet, N. B., and a number of other establishments less important. They number about fifteen establishments and about one hundred and twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where the majority Still remains, the Eudists continue to preach missions and to take part in various other works.
