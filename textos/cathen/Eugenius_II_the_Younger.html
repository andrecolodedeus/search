<h1>Eugenius II (the Younger)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo from 647 to 13 Nov., 657, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death. He was the son of a Goth named Evantius, became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Toledo, and at the death of Eugenius I was elected his successor. The office was so little to his taste that he fled to Saragossa to lead a monastic life, but was forced to return to Toledo by King Chindaswith and take up the government of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Though of small stature and feeble health he was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. He undertook the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chant of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and achieved distinction as a writer of prose and poetry. His style is natural and clear, and his exposition easy and agreeable. His poems, though lacking polish and elegance, are full of fire, spirit, and poetic movement. Piety breathes throughout, and the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is notable. His thought is solid, fertile, and gives evidence of a well-trained mind. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 13 November.

<p>Eugenius left two books in prose and verse, published (Paris, 1619) by <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Father Sirmond, S.J.</a>, containing his poems on religious and secular subjects, his recension of the poem of Dracontius on "The Six days of Creation" (Hexaemeron), to which he added a "Seventh Day", and a letter to King Chindaswith explaining the plan of the entire work; he also edited the metrical "Satisfactio" of Dracontius, an account of the writer's misfortunes. Of this work Bardenhewer says (Patrology, tr. St. Louis, 1908, p. 619) that it "underwent a substantial revision at the hands of Eugenius II, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toledo, in keeping with the wish of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> King Chindaswith (642-49); not only were the poetical form and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the poem affected by this treatment, but probably also its political sentiments. It is this revision that was usually printed as Dracontii Elegia (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXXVIII, 383-88), until the edition of Ar&eacute;valo (Rome, 1791, 362-402, and 901-32) made known the original text". He also wrote a treatise on the Trinity probably against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>. Ferrera mentions a letter of Eugenius to the king and one to Protasius, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, promising if possible to write a mass of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> and some festal sermons, but disclaiming the ability to equal his former productions.
