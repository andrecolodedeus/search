<h1>Eug&egrave;ne Bor&eacute;</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, 15 Aug., 1809; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 3 May, 1878. From the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Angers he went to the Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where at eighteen he won the prize in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in a competition of all the colleges of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, one rival being Alfred de Musset. After a year at law he devoted himself to the study of languages, In 1829 with his brother L&eacute;on, also a linguist and a noted translator, he joined the coterie of the <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Abb&eacute; F&eacute;licit&eacute; de Lamennais</a>, to which he introduced his college-mate, Maurice de Gu&eacute;rin. With <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> he tried to persuade <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> to submit and did not give up hope of the latter's return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until 1851.

<p>Member of the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Society in 1833, he won fame in the "Journal Asiatique". He was professor of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> (1833-34) at the Coll&egrave;ge de France. Sent to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he published the results of his literary labours there in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a>. Spending six months of 1837 in study at Constantinople, he went with Father Scaffi, C.M., to <a href="../cathen/05527b.htm">ErzerumTheodosiopolis)</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. At Tauris he started a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as an opening wedge for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, whose service was always his chief concern. The Shah of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him for the excellence of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In addition to many learned studies sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, his interesting letters were published as "The Correspondence of a Traveller in the Orient". In 1841 he secured <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missioners for <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. For services to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in that land he was given the cross of the Legion of Honour. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> made him a Knight of the Golden Militia in 1842 and Knight of St. Gregory the Great in 1843. Knowing forty Oriental idioms, most of them thoroughly, he published in some of these tongues excellent controversial works. He was eager for the return of the schismatics to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and was aided in his apostolate by his wide acquaintance with the most learned and influential men of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He published an illuminating report of the condition of the Holy Land whither he was sent by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to investigate in 1847. Entering the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> in Jan., 1849, at Constantinople, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there, 7 April, 1850, and made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in Jan., 1851. Sent to Constantinople, as head of the College of Bebek, he remained fifteen years doing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> work for the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> especially on the battlefield during the Crimean War. In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1866 he was made secretary general, and was elected superior general of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, 11 Sept., 1874. His incumbency of the latter office was cut short at the end of four years by a sudden illness.
