<h1>Eug&egrave;ne Fromentin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> writer and artist; b. at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, 24 October, 1820; d. at Saint-Maurice, near <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, 26 August, 1876. His father, a distinguished physician and art connoisseur, intended him for the bar. After a brilliant course of studies, the young man came to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in November, 1839, to follow the lectures in law. In 1843 he became associated with Ma&icirc;tre D&eacute;normandie, an attorney-at-law. But his literary and artistic inclinations gradually rendered his profession insupportable. Marilhat's exhibition of 1844 definitely decided him to devote himself to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. He became a pupil of Cabat, who was, with Flers, Huet, Corot, and Rousseau, one of the restorers of modern landscape <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. A short journey to Algeria, in 1846, showed him more clearly the line he was to follow. In 1848 and 1852 he again visited that country, to garner material for his work. He exhibited at the Salon in 1847. In 1850 he sent in eleven <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, and was awarded a second-class medal. The only other notable events in his life were a voyage to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the autumn of 1869, in the company of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, at the time of the opening of the Suez Canal; and a short stay of some weeks in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, in July, 1875, where he obtained matter for his book, Les Ma&icirc;tres d'autrefois". He was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1859, and officer in 1869. He married in 1851.

<p>In his lifetime, it was as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> rather than as writer that he became renowned. Orientalism was then in vogue. It suited the romantic tastes of the age, and satisfied the general curiosity for exotic customs. Great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> like Decamps, <a href="../cathen/04689b.htm">Delacroix</a>, and Marilhat, had already made a specialty of it. Moreover, all thoughts were turned towards Algeria, a new, mysterious country, only half-conquered, which had just been the scene of a long colonial <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The public were never weary of hearing about it. Since the land has become so well known, this interest has ceased; and it must be admitted that Fromentin's reputation has suffered in consequence. Such is the penalty of a success partly based on the informative and teaching qualities of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> art. The actuality has ceased to interest us; and the glory of the artist who depended on it must necessarily fade. But Fromentin is far from deserving the obscurity into which he is now relegated. His work, as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, is that of a charming artist, the work of a landscapist and a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of customs, who had the secret <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of becoming an historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and who, wisely enough, selected in the modern world subjects and plan best accommodated to his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and his ability. Fromentin's art, either by the nature of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> or the dimensions, rarely surpasses the "genre" properly so called; and yet there is something naturally impressive in the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> life and manners, in that nomadic, <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a>, warlike existence, the majestic simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> spaces, and the immutable tranquillity of the Orient. Finally, one cannot fail to recognize the distinctive mark of Fromentin's art. He is not a faultless <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, but he is one of exquisite delicacy. After 1860, especially, under the influence of Corot, he becomes one of the cleverest modern "harmonists". His blue slate-coloured Algerian pictures, with their remarkable greyish tints, have not been excelled. As a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> horse, in the "Cur&eacute;e" of the Louvre, he has no rival. Sometimes he is eloquent, as in the "Simoun", the "Soif", or the famous "Rue d'El Aghouat". But the works that show his art its best are those that depict both customs and scenery, as the "Passage du Gu&eacute;" (New York), the "Chasse au Faucon" (Chantilly): in these he is a kind of modern Wouverman, more elegant and poetic than the former. And one may anticipate the day when, Africa in its turn having been subjected to civilization, industry, and uniformity, these pictures will be the sole witness of its ancient customs, and will then assume their historic signification.

<p>It is, however, as a writer that Fromentin is rising more and more to fame. His work is very varied. As a result of his travels, he published, under the titles of: "Un &eacute;t&eacute; dans le Sahara" (Paris, 1856); and "Une ann&eacute;e dans le Sahel" (Paris, 1858), the souvenirs of his two last sojourns in Algeria. In these he inaugurates a new method of description, much less literary than <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand's</a>, less "technical" than Gautier's, a method which, in French tradition, marks the transition from Bernardin de Saint-Pierre to Loti. "Dominique" appeared a year later (Paris, 1862). This autobiography and transparent history of a pure youthful <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is, together with "Adolphe" and the "Princesse de Cl&egrave;ves", one of the masterpieces of the French "roman d'analyse". But the work that will transmit Fromentin's name to posterity is his "Ma&icirc;tres d'autrefois" (Paris, 1876). This book is composed from the notes made during a journey through <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> to study the old <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>; or rather, this journey was the occasion of the work. For the author, in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> he saw, discusses, in passing, the questions of &aelig;sthetic moment which he raises. It may be said that this book really originated artistic criticism. As a critic Diderot is purely literary, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> metaphysical, Ruskin religious, moral, or apocalyptic, Taine historical, or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>; but Fromentin made criticism strictly "artistic", that is to say, he seeks the secret of the significance, value, and beauty of a picture solely in an examination of the work, its style, and its methods of execution. It is through the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> thus understood and examined that he succeeds in determining the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and the moral characteristics of the author. Here Fromentin is a great creator and a great writer, who really invents everything: methods, systems, and terminology. Some of his descriptions of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are the last word in the art of writing. Certain of his analyses, such as those of <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> and Rembrandt, are definitive, and fix, forever, both the rules of the style or class, and the portraits of these great men. If to <em>understand</em> is to <em>equal</em>, it is by such pages that this distinguished writer, who has won a place among the first prose-writers of the last century, has really added something to the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> &mdash; that is to say &mdash; the manner of expressing it in writing.
