<h1>Eug&eacute;nie de Gramont</h1>  

<p>Religious of the Society of the Sacred Heart; b. at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 17 September, 1788; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 19 November, 1846. Her father, the Count de Gramont d'Aster, was attached to the Court of Louis XVI; he had married a daughter of the Count de Boisgelin, maid of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/09665a.htm">Queen Marie Antoinette</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was driven into exile by the fall of the monarchy and, after travelling in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, settled at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. After the death of the Count de Gramont d'Aster his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> was for a time in straitened circumstances, and maintained herself and her child by teaching. She soon returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where Eug&eacute;nie learnt, at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the new Society of the Sacred Heart, of which she became a member in 1806. Her mother also joined it a few years afterwards, and made her <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> under the guidance of her own daughter. In 1815, notwithstanding her youth and the drawback of a slight physical deformity, Mother de Gramont was placed in charge of the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Sacred Heart, opened in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Rue des Postes, afterwards transferred to the Rue de Varenne. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> flourished under her care and, after a short interruption of her work by the revolution of 1830, she was sent back to govern the house as superioress and continued to do so until her death in 1846. Mother de Gramont's remarkable intelligence and influence were of great value in the important work entrusted to her, and she established the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the Rue de Varenne so firmly in its position that the only anxiety of the foundress of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> concerning it was the success, almost too brilliant for her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of hiddenness and simplicity, which attended the work. She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the weak side of Mother de Gramont's character as well as her great gifts, and she was not deceived as to the dangers of a mind which was too receptive of strong influences and very difficult to disillusion. In a time of trial, during the first year of her <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, when the existence of the Society of the Sacred Heart was in great danger, Mother de Gramont was one of those who were misled by the action of M. de St. Esteve; and again, in another critical moment in 1839, she took a line of conduct in opposition to the foundress which she afterwards recognized and deplored to the end of her life; her sorrow for her <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it is said, hastened her death. She died in the most perfect union of affection with the foundress, <a href="../cathen/02283a.htm">Blessed Madeleine Sophie Barat</a>, asking pardon of her and of the whole <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of judgment into which she had been led  &mdash; her personal devotedness to the mother general had never wavered.
