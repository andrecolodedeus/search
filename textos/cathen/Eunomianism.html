<h1>Eunomianism</h1>  

<p>A phase of extreme <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> prevalent amongst a section of Eastern <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> from about 350 until 381; as a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> it is not heard of after the middle of the fifth century. The teaching of Arius was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, and the word <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm"><em>homoousion</em></a> adopted as the touchstone of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The subsequent history of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> history is the history of the endeavours of arianizing sympathizers to get rid of the obnoxious word. The diplomacy of court intriguers forms the dark background against which stand out Eusebians and <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>. Imperial influence had been all-powerful too long in the official religion to allow imperial ingerence in church affairs to cease with the imperial change of attitude towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. That influence was exercised through the court <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> tinged with the fundamental <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> underlying <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. They skilfully avoided the real issue, represented the whole affair as merely a question of the propriety of using particular terms, and for a time deluded those who were unfamiliar with the <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> of the question. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> was represented as a political fire-brand whose watchword was <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>.</em> The Emperor Constantius (337-361), to his great personal annoyance, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to allow <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> to return from his second exile (339-346) to Alexandria (31 October, 346). The lull which seemed to follow the return of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was due to the political circumstances arising out of the disastrous Persian War and the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>; and it was not until the victory of Mount Seleucus (13 August, 353) that the emperor's hands were freed.

<p>In the meantime a new and more defiant <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was arising, impatient of diplomacy, and less pliant to imperial dictation. It frankly returned to the fullest expression of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Arius, and sought to defend it on the rationalizing basis of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> dialectics. The history of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> coincides with the life-history of A&euml;tius and Eunomius. A&euml;tius, its founder, successively a goldsmith, physician, and grammarian, turned his attention to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> under <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> influences at Antioch and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> categories henceforth formed the limits of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the abuse of the syllogism his principal weapon. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at Antioch in 350, he was deposed by Leontius and sought refuge at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, where he found a disciple in Eunomius. Radical and uncompromising in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> thinking, they asserted that in substance and in all else the Son is unlike the Father: <em>animoios</em>, "unlike", became their watchword as against the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> of the Orthodox, the <em>homoiousios</em> of the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, and the later <em>homoios</em> of the <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Acacians</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> extremists became known as Aetians, and later as Eunomians and Anomoeans. Their doctrines were received favourably by Eudoxius of Antioch and the Synod of Antioch in 358; but the formulation of their tenets produced a reaction, and in the same year they were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> and at the Third Synod of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, and the leaders were exiled for a short time to Pepuza. They reappeared, however, at the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> Synod of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> (September, 359), where <a href="../cathen/01081a.htm">Acacius of Caesarea</a> rejected the <em>animoios</em> and the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Homoeans</a> led to the exile of A&euml;tius to Mopsuestia in Cilicia and later to Amblada in <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>. After 360 the Anomoean <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> ceased to be formidable. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (361-363) allowed A&euml;tius to return; he was rehabilitated in an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> synod, and died c.370. Meanwhile Eunomius, supported by his friend Eudoxius, transferred from Antioch to Constantinople (January, 360), became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Orthodox See of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> in Mysia. His flock appealed to Constantius, who <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Eudoxius to take action against him. Deposed in his absence and banished, Eunomius founded a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of his own, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> some of his followers. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> recalled both A&euml;tius and Eunomius, who acquired considerable importance in Constantinople. The Synod of Antioch, 362, explicitly set forth the Anomoean <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that "the Son is in all things unlike (<em>kata panta anomoios</em>) the Father, as well in will as in substance". The death of Eudoxius in 370 marks the beginning of the end of Eunomianism. The sectaries were excluded from the benefit of Gratian's edict of toleration (end of 378), were directly condemned by the Council of Constantinople (381), and were the objects of special repressive measures in addition to those directed against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in general. Moreover, disruptive forces were at work within the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. Eunomius died about 395, and for all practical purposes the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> may be said to have died with him.

<p>The dogmatic system of Eunomius is characterized at once by its presumptuous dialectics and its shallowness. His <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning Christ are founded upon his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> theodicy, which involves the assertion that a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of simplicity cannot be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of mystery at all, for even man is as competent as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to comprehend simplicity. Eunomius proclaims the absolute intelligibility of the Divine Essence: "God knows no more of His own substance, than we do; nor is this more known to Him, and less to us: but whatever we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about the Divine substance, that precisely is known to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; on the other hand, whatever He knows, the same also you will find without any difference in us" (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26014.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.7</a>). <em>Agennesia</em>, he maintains, perfectly expresses the Divine Essence: as the Unbegotten, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an absolutely simple being: an act of generation would involve a contradiction of His essence, by introducing duality into the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>. The Father is <em>agennetos</em>, the Son <em>gennetos</em>; hence, he held, there must be diversity of substance. The general line of his sophistical reasoning against the Orthodox was as follows: You allow <em>agennesia</em> to be a <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attribute</a>. Now the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> excludes all multiplicity of attributes. Consequently <em>agennesia</em> is the only attribute which befits the Divine nature, the only one therefore essential to Him. In other words, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is essentially incapable of being begotten. Hence it is folly to speak of a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begotten, of a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>agennetos</em> and <em>anarchos</em>, unbegotten and without beginning, could not communicate His own substance, nor beget even a <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> Son; consequently there could be no question of identity of substance (<em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>) or of likeness of substance (<em>homoiousios</em>) between the Father and the Son. There could be no essential resemblance (<em>kat ousian</em>), but at most a moral resemblance. for the Son is a being drawn forth from nothing by the will of the Father, yet superior to all Creation inasmuch as He alone was created by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">One God</a> to be the Creator of the world. He does not share in the incommunicable Divine Essence (<em>ousia</em>), but he does partake in the communicable Divine creative power (<em>energeia</em>), and it is that partaking which constitutes the Son's Divinity and establishes Him, as regards creation, in the position of Creator: and as the principle of paternity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the <em>ousia</em> but the <em>energeia</em>, the sense in which the term <em><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em> may be used is clear.

<p>The works of Eunomius are of less importance in themselves than in the fact that they called forth the best efforts of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>. His Commentary on the Romans and his letters have perished. His "Apologeticus" (P.G., XXX, 835), written before 365, seeks to refute the Nicene teaching concerning the coeternal and <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> Divinity of the Son. It is extremely obscure, and has been frequently misunderstood. For example, <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, VI, 501-516, needs careful checking. It was against this work of Eunomius that St. Basil wrote his "Adversus Eunomium" (<em>Antirretikon</em>) in five books. (It is clear, however, that books IV and V are from another pen.) Eunomius retorted with his <em>Apologia hyper apologias</em> (Defence of the Defence), written after the death of St. Basil (1 January, 379), wherein he does his best to defend more fully and by new arguments his teaching concerning the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a>. This work was elaborately refuted by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> in his lengthy "Adversus Eunomium", of which some twelve books have come down to us preserving the fragmentary remains of the <em>Apologia</em>, which are gathered in Rettberg's "Marcelliana" (Gottingen, 1794, pp.124-147). A very full analysis of it is found in <a href="../cathen/04785b.htm">Diekamp</a>, "Gotteslehre des hl. Gregor von Nyssa" (1896), I, 123 sqq. The third extant work is his <em>ekthesis pisteos</em>, or "Confession of Faith", presented by order to the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> in 383. (See <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">ARIANISM</a>.)
