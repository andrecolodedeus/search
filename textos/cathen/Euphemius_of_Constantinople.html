<h1>Euphemius of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>Euphemius of Constantinople (490-496) succeeded as patriarch Flavitas (or Fravitas, 489-490), who succeeded Acacius (471-489). The great <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (484-519), therefore, lasted during his reign. The Emperor Zeno (474-491) had published a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> called the "Henotikon" (482) that forbade in the current <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussions any other criterion but that of Nicaea-Constantinople (ignoring the decrees of Chalcedon), carefully avoided speaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and used ambiguous formulae that were meant to conciliate the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. The "Henotikon" really satisfied no one. Consistent <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> disliked it as much as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. But Acacius at the capital, <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and Peter Fullo (Gnapheus) of Antioch, signed it. <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Pope Felix III</a> (or II, 483-492) in a Roman synod of sixty-seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (484) condemned the emperor's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, deposed and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Acacius, <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>, and Peter Fullo. Acacius retorted by striking the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name from his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at Constantinople. When he died, Flavitas, his successor, applied for recognition at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but in vain, since he would not give up communion with <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>. Euphemius recognized the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, restored the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name to his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and broke with <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>, who died in the year of Euphemius's accession (490). He was therefore a well-meaning <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who wanted to restore the union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Unfortunately he still refused to erase the names of his two predecessors (Acacius and Flavitas) from the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, where they occurred among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> insisted that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and favourers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should not be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for publicly in the Liturgy; so during the reign of Euphemius the union he desired was not brought about. But Euphemius was always a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at heart. Before the accession of the Emperor Anastasius I (491-518) he had made him sign a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, H.E., III, xxxii). After the death of <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Pope Felix</a>, Euphemius wrote to his successor, Gelasius I (492-496), again asking for intercommunion on any terms but the condemnation of Acacius. This time, too, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused to modify his condition (Gelasii Epist. et Decret.; P.L., LIX, 13). The patriarch had already summoned a synod at Constantinople in which he confirmed the decrees of Chalcedon (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 1180). Eventually he fell foul of the emperor. A <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Bulgars and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> was then going on, and Euphemius was accused of treason by revealing the emperor's plans to his enemies. A soldier tried, unsuccessfully, to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the patriarch, apparently by order of Anastasius. The emperor further wanted to have back his written profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which Euphemius refused to give up. so he was deposed (496) in spite of the resistance of the people, and Macedonius II (496-511) was appointed successor. Macedonius seems to have been unwilling to take his place and refused to wear patriarchal vestments in his presence. Euphemius was exiled to <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and died in 515 at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>. He was recognized to the end as lawful patriarch by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the East (<a href="../cathen/05385a.htm">Elias of Jerusalem</a>, Flavian of Antioch, etc.).
