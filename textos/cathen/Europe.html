<h1>Europe</h1>  

<h2>Name</h2>

<p>The conception of Europe as a distinct division of the earth, separate from <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa, had its origin in ancient times. The sailors of the Aegean Sea applied the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> designations Ereb (sunset, west) and Acu (sunrise, east) to the countries lying respectively west and east of the sea; in this way it became customary to call Greece and the territory back of it Europe, while <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and the parts beyond were named <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. At a later date the mass of land lying to the south of the Mediterranean was set off as a distinct division of the earth with the name of Libya or Africa.
<h2>Position, boundaries, and area</h2>

<p>Europe is a large peninsula forming the western part of the northern continent of the Eastern Hemisphere. On the north and west it is separated from North America by the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans; on the south by the Mediterranean Sea from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In the east there is no clear natural division from the continental mass of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Such a dividing line may be drawn along the crest of the Ural and Mugadzhar Mountains, the Emba River, Caspian Sea, and the lowlands of the Manitch River, or through the depression that, starting from the Gulf of Obi, extends through the valleys of the Obi, Irtysh, Tobol, and Emba Rivers. The political boundary extends beyond the Ural Mountains towards the east, and beyond the Ural River to the south and west runs along the range called Obtschei Syrt and the Usen River, and encloses within the eastern boundary of Europe the whole of the Caucasus. The most northern point of Europe is North Cape (71 deg. 12 min. N. lat.) on the Island of Mageroe belonging to <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>; the most western point is Cape da Roca (9 deg. 31 min. west of Greenwich) in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; the most southern is Cape Tarifa (35 deg. 59 min. 53 sec. N.) in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; the Continent extends as far to the east as 65 deg. longitude east of Greenwich. Its greatest length from north to south is 2,398 miles, from west to east, 3,455 miles. The statement as to the extent of its area varies, according to the position assigned to its eastern boundary, from 3,672,969 sq. miles to 4,092,660 sq. miles. This measurement includes the polar islands Iceland, Nova Zembla, and Spitzbergen, but not the Canary, Madeira, and <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores Islands</a>.
<h2>Geological formation</h2>

<p>Three leading tectonic divisions are to be distinguished in the geological formation of Europe. These appeared in the middle Tertiary period. Western Europe, as far south as the Alps, the Pyrenees, and, reaching beyond the Pyrenees, into the Spanish Peninsula, to the east as far as the Baltic and the Vistula River, is formed of debris and sedimentary deposits. This has been produced by the breaking up and overflowing with water of mountain chains that now exist as secondary ranges, as the Scotch Highlands, the central plateau of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the mountain chain of Central <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Towards the east is low-lying land that has remained the same from early times. Sweden and Finland form together a great level called the Plain of the Baltic, south-east from which spreads the great Russian plain which is limited by the Ural and Carpathian Mountains, the Crimea, and the Caucasus Mountains. The whole of Southern Europe and a part of Middle Europe is a region of late folded mountain ranges. These begin with the Pyrenees, which have remarkable spurs in the ranges of Provence, in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. The ranges of <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> find their continuation in the Atlas range, which bends to the east and reappears in Europe in the mountains of the northern coast of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the Apennines. The north-western Apennines pass into the Alpine system. In the east the Alps are divided into three chains; of these the middle one passes into the Hungarian plain; the Carpathian and Balkan ranges unite in a great bend with the northern chain, and the southern one is continued by the Dinaric Alps and the western chains of the Balkan Peninsula as far as Crete and the south-western part of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Numerous islands belong to the Continent of Europe. The separation of the islands from the mainland arose in two ways. In the north and west, the encroachment of the sea produced bays and peninsulas and formed islands. In the south, the western and eastern basins of the Mediterranean, those of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas, the Sea of Marmora, and the southern part of the Black and Caspian Seas, were formed by folding; and in this way also were formed the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan Peninsulas and the archipelago lying between Greece and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The rivers of Europe belong to three different basins, namely, to the Caspian Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and the Arctic Ocean. The courses of the rivers of Europe are much shorter than the courses of those of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, or America. The largest of the European rivers, the Volga (1,978 miles), the Danube (1,771 miles), Dnieper (1,329 miles), Don (1,120 miles), Petchora (1,023 miles), and the Dniester (835 miles), flow into seas that are almost entirely cut off from the ocean, consequently from the world's traffic. They offer, however, little obstruction to navigation, and numerous canals are cut through the main watershed that extends from <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a> to the northern Urals. The largest number of lakes is found in the region, formerly covered with glaciers, lying north of 50 deg. N. lat. &#151; Finland, Scandinavia, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the region of the Alps. Besides this lake region, lakes have also been formed in the Alps by folding, in the Balkan by the breaking in of the surface, and in the Apennine Peninsula by volcanic outbreaks.
<h2>Climate, flora, fauna</h2>

<p>The climatic conditions of Europe are very favourable. Almost the entire continent, excepting the northern point, belongs to the temperate zone. At the same time it is much warmer than other countries in the same latitude, as, for instance, than eastern North America, because along its western coast flows the Gulf Stream, which leaves the coast of <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> with a temperature of 68 deg. Fahr. and raises the normal temperature on the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> coast about 7.2 Fahr. deg., of the British coast by 9 to 14.4 Fahr. deg., and of the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> coast, about 14.4 to 18 Fahr. deg. Since there is no chain of mountains traversing Europe from north to south, as is the case with North America, the influence of the Gulf Stream extends far into the interior of the mainland. On the borders of the Arctic Ocean a rigorous climate prevails, summer is short, and during the greater of the year the temperature is below freezing. This northern region has polar vegetation; the rolling plains called tundras are found on the peninsulas of Kanin and Kola and at the mouth of the Petchora. The sub-arctic zone is found south of this in the Scandinavian Peninsula down to 60 deg. N. lat.; here the climate of the coast, influenced by the sea, in milder in winter and cool in summer. The part of Europe properly included in the temperate zone is divided into the following regions: the countries lying on the Atlantic, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, Brittany, the Channel, and northwestern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; this section has moderate temperature and large rainfall; west and middle Europe, with an inland climate, less heavy rainfall (about 19.7 inches), and moderate changes of temperature (27 to 45 Fahr. deg.); in this section the southern part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> forms an exception, as also the depression of the Upper Rhine, and the mountains. Beyond this is the section of Eastern Europe or <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, with a completely inland climate, the variations of temperature amounting to 45 Fahr. deg., and the rainfall to less than 23.6 inches. Finally comes the section of the Euxine comprising the great <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> plain, the plain of the Balkan provinces, and southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; in this division the spring is moist and warm and midsummer, hot and dry. The depression of the Caspian belongs to the dry zone of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>.



<p>The forests of Europe flourish in the temperate zone. In <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> they are composed chiefly of pine; the only deciduous tree found in the highest latitudes is the birch (betula odorata); the forests of pines and deciduous trees are found south of 61 deg. N. lat.; this region is further characterized by grass-lands, heaths, and moors. The cultivated land, which in Central and Western Europe is about sixty to seventy per cent, is divided into farm land, cultivated forest land, grass and pasture land. From north to south the succession of grains is as follows: barley, rye and oats, wheat, especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and maize. Potatoes are cultivated on less fruitful soil. In this region native fruits are the apple, pear, and cherry; finer kinds of fruit trees, as the peach, apricot, plum, and of nut trees, the walnut and almond, have been introduced from the south. In this region the grape is also cultivated; its northern limit, extending from the mouth of the Loire, passes to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the Rhine near <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, then towards the Unstrut and Saale Rivers, and reaches its most northerly point on the Oder below 52 deg. N. lat.; the limit of its cultivation here turns to the south-east until it reaches the Sea of Azov. The region of the Mediterranean, that is the Iberian Peninsula, Provence, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to the foot of the Alps, and the Balkan Peninsula south of 42 deg. N. lat., has a subtropical climate. Here flourish trees and bushes which are always green; among those that are cultivated for their products are the citron, orange, fig, almond, mulberry, and pomegranate trees. The fauna of Europe is in accord with the climate and vegetation. In Northern Europe are found the polar bear, polar fox, and reindeer; in the region of forests live the bear, wolf, and lynx, which have, however, almost disappeared; the region of the Mediterranean contains numerous reptiles.
<h2>Population, political divisions, and religions</h2>

<p>The greater part of the population of Europe belong to the European or Mediterranean race. The main race-groups are the Teutonic, Romanic, and Slavonic. To the Teutonic division belong: the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>, English, and Scandinavians; it contains in all 127,800,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or 32.1 per cent of the whole population; included in the Romanic group are: the French, Walloons, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, Friulians, natives of the Rhaetian Alps, Maltese, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, and Rumanians, in all 108,100,000, or 27.1 per cent; included in the Slavonic are: the Russians, <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Wends, Slovenes, Croats, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Serbs</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, Letts, and Lithuanians, in all 124,600,000, or 31.3 per cent. A smaller number, about 9,500,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or 2.4 per cent is composed of other Aryan races: Celts, Greeks, <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albanians</a>, Gypsies, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, etc. There are also about 27,900,000, or some 7 per cent, of non-Aryan races: Basques, Magyars, <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finns</a>, the tribes of the Ural region, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, Kalmucks, and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The total population of Europe amounts to about 420,000,000.

<p>The organization of the present States of Europe may be traced back to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Most of the States are limited by natural boundaries within which each has developed its own individual character. The States vary greatly in size and population; most of them are constitutional monarchies, the only republics being <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The British Isles, united as Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, have a total area of 121,622 sq. miles and 43,722,000 inhabitants; as a natural consequence of the geographical position of the islands, the nation is largely interested in colonial enterprises. The Scandinavian Peninsula is halved by an uninhabited mountain range, thus permitting the existence of two countries, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Sweden. <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, lying on the Atlantic, has an area of 123,938 miles and 2,300,000 inhabitants; Sweden, on the Baltic, has an area of 172,973 sq. miles and 5,261,000 inhabitants. The peninsula and islands lying south of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Sweden form the third Scandinavian state, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, that controls the entrance to the Baltic. <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> has an area of 14,672 sq. miles and 2,450,000 inhabitants. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the western part of the continental mass, has an area of 206,950 sq. miles and a population of 39,060,000; it has the advantage, excepting towards the north-east, of having for its boundaries either seas or mountain ranges. Between Western and Central Europe lie the so-called "buffer" States: <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> with an area of 11,197 sq. miles and 7,075,000 inhabitants; the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, area 12,741 sq. miles, inhabitants 5,510,000; <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, area 15,830 sq. miles, inhabitants 3,425,000. The <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, area 208,880 sq. miles inhabitants 60,605,000, covers the greater part of central Europe. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> borders upon nearly all the great powers of Europe and has, therefore, developed a large army. The State having the least organic union geographically and ethnographically, and consequently in constant danger of internal disorganization, is the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Monarchy. Its area is 261,004 sq. miles, population 49,092,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, area 2,081,079 sq. miles, inhabitants 119,115,000, occupies the lowland of Europe and, in its largest extent, stretches beyond Europe into the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> plain. Southern Europe embraces numerous states with sharply defined boundaries. The Iberian Peninsula is divided between <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, a country lying on the ocean and having a great maritime past, has an area of 43,363 sq. miles, inhabitants 5,016,000; <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, area 191,892 sq. miles, inhabitants 18,249,000. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> belongs completely to the lands of the Mediterranean; its area is 110,811 sq. miles, population 33,604,000. The physical contour of the Balkan Peninsula is so broken up by mountain ranges that it fails to show any one organically large State. Its divisions at the present time are: <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, 37,066 sq. miles, population 3,744,400; Montenegro, 3,475 sq. miles, population 228,000; Rumania, 50,579 sq. miles, population 6,392,000; Servia, 18,533 sq. miles, population 2,677,000; European Turkey, 65,251 sq. miles, population 6,130,000; Greece, 25,000 sq. miles, population 2,440,000.

<p>By far the greater proportion of the inhabitants of Europe belong to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. One-fourth of the population are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, somewhat over one-fourth belong to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christian Churches</a>, nearly 45 per cent are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 41 per cent are non-Christian. In the Romanic States 99 per cent of the population are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; in the Teutonic States 74 per cent are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and less than one per cent non-Christian. In the States of Eastern Europe, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and the Balkan provinces, 57 percent belong to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>, 9.2 per cent are non-Christian, 6 per cent are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and 27 per cent are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are the Kalmucks living between the Ural and Caucasus mountains, the Finns of the Volga, and the Samoyedes. About 8,250,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or 2.1 per cent of the whole population of Europe are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>; these are limited to several tribes of the Uralo-Altaic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and to the former territories of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>; among the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> are a large portion of the Albanians, some of the Serbs in <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, and a part of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Europe number 9,000,000 or 2.2 per cent; they are to be found chiefly in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Monarchy, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, and Turkey. (The above figures are based on Hettner, op.cit. infra.)
<h2>Christianity</h2>

<p>European civilization is founded on that of the East; from Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> Europe received its food-plants, domestic animals, method of writing, numerals, the beginnings of art and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and the higher forms of state organization and religion. The various States of Greece, the European neighbour of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, transmitted these by trade and the foundation of colonies to the countries lying on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean and to Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from its central position imparted them to Western and Northern Europe and united the civilized parts of the continent into a great empire. At the time of its greatest extent imperial <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> included, on European soil, the present countries of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> west of the Rhine and south of the Danube, the countries bordering on the Danube as far as the Black Sea, and the whole Balkan Peninsula, besides all the islands of the Mediterranean. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, too, came from the East by way of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The connexion existing between the various Roman provinces and the wide prevalence of the Latin and Greek tongues were most favourable to its spread. When the structure erected by the Caesars fell to pieces, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> not only entered into its inheritance but also subdued all those barbarian peoples that had up to then defied the imperial power. The Gospel was brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by colonies of Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who kept up close relations with Palestine, their mother country. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> brought <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to Greece on his second journey (49-52 A.D.) when he founded, with the aid of Silas, Timothy, and Luke, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, <a href="../cathen/02513b.htm">Beroea</a>, <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> great letters and his journeys to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, perhaps also to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, prepared the way for the close connexion between the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> and <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Christians</a> and strengthened them for the work of spreading the Gospel. In fact the first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> in 64 was not able to crush the new movement, and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the many other later persecutions.

<p>Towards the end of the first century, under Clement, the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at that time, there was a close bond between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. It is also to be assumed that in the meantime all the commercial cities on the coasts of the Mediterranean had <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in their midst, and that before long the regions adjoining these cities accepted the Gospel. According to tradition the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Gaul was founded by Trophimus, who was sent there by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; to Crescentius, a disciple of the Apostles, is ascribed the preaching of the Gospel in Vienne and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; and to Dionysius the Areopagite, the founding of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. To Eucharius and Maternus, two disciples of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, are attributed the founding of the Churches of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and Cologne. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that flourishing <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> arose in <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Vienne during the reign of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> (161-80). At the beginning of the third century, according to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Adv. Judaeos, i), various tribes of Gaul had accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. At about the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em></a>) speaks of Churches in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had at that time spread into all the provinces of the Spanish Peninsula. According to the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (Histor. gentis Angl., I, iii), the first missionaries came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the reign of Pope Eleutherius (177-90). By the opening of the third century the British Church had spread beyond the Roman possessions in Britain and may even have embraced <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In the meantime the barbarians living along the northern boundaries of the Roman Empire had begun their migrations and predatory incursions. Along this border lived the tribes of the Teutonic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, divided by the Oder into the East Germans and West Germans. The East Germans included the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> and <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, Heruli, Rugii, and Scyrri. The West Germans were divided into the Ingvaeones or Germans on the sea-coast, including the later Frisians and Anglo-Saxons; the Istvaeones or the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> of the Rhine, including the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> between the Weser and Rhine; the Hermiones, among whom were the later Thuringians and the upper German tribes of the Alamanni and Bavarians (Bajuvarii). As early as the years 161-80 the Marcomanni, a West German tribe, advanced as far as Aquileia; they were defeated, but introduced northern elements into the population. After this failure the current of the migration divided into two streams: one to the south-east, the migration of the East Germans; one to the south-west, the migration of the West Germans. Of the East Germans, the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> reached the lower Danube and the Black Sea and divided, according to these respective positions, into the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> and <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>. In 375, on account of the pouring in of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> hordes through the gateway of the nations between the Urals and the Caspian, the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> came under the power of the Huns. The <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, who were also hard pressed, retreated towards <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> and received land somewhat south of this from the Emperors <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> and <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>. When, after the death of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, the Roman Empire was divided in 395 into the Western and Eastern Empires, ruled respectively by his sons Honorius and Arcadius, the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> under Alaric plundered Thrace and Greece and, with the permission of Arcadius, settled in <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. From here they pressed toward <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in 410 even entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They then turned towards South-Eastern Gaul and in 419 founded the first German kingdom on Roman soil, its capital being <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; they also conquered a large part of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 507 the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> were forced to give up their possessions in Gaul to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and in 531 the capital of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Kingdom was transferred to Toledo.

<p>The recall from the Rhine of the Roman legions needed for the struggle against Alaric left the way to the south-west open to two other East German peoples, the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, who had formerly lived between the Oder and the Vistula, crossed the Rhine in 406 and founded a kingdom having its capital at Worms; in 437 this kingdom was broken up by the Roman governor A&euml;tius, but another arose in 443 around Geneva and Lyons; this, however, in 532, was absorbed into the Kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. In 406 the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> left their home on the northern slope of the mountains called Riesengebirge, and in union with the Alani and Suevi passed through Gaul into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> drove them out of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> into the Roman provinces in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, whence for a long time they controlled the Mediterranean and in 455 ravaged <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 476 Odoacer, the leader of the mercenaries made up of Heruli, Rugii, and Scyrri, seized the government and called himself King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At almost the same time the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> in Pannonia were again free, as the power of the Huns was broken in the great battle on the Catalaunian Fields near Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne in 451. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, the King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, conquered Odoacer in 489 and created a kingdom (493-526) that embraced <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, a part of Pannonia, Rhaetia, and the Province; this kingdom went to pieces in 553. The <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> were followed by the Lombards, a tribe of the lower Elbe, who, passing through Pannonia, reached <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 568 under their King Alboin; it was not until 771 that the Lombards were brought under subjection by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. All these peoples were to disappear in order, by their absorption into the civilization of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to bring about the union of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the state religion of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> since the time of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, with a more stable power, the united West Germans.

<p>The West Germans, although their migrations were not very extended, had changed their habitations as follows: in the fourth century the Alamanni advanced into Alsace and in the fifth century took entire possession of it, spreading towards the north as far as Coblenz. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> were divided into the Ripuarian and Salian <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>; the former settled on both sides of the middle and lower Rhine, the latter advanced from the Scheldt to the Somme. Towards the end of the third century the Saxons advanced from the Elbe to the Rhine; in the fifth century, with the aid of the Angles, they conquered Britain; the former inhabitants of Britain took refuge in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and gave their name to Brittany. The Frisians settled on the coast and islands of Schleswig-Holstein; the Thuringians spread from the lower Elbe to the southern bank of the Main. The Bajuvarii went farthest south. At the time of the birth of Christ they lived in modern <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; about 500 their territory extended from the Lech to the Enns and from the Danube to the junction of the Eisack and the Adige. The region occupied by the tribes just named enlarged the scene of European history; all that was now needed was the political and spiritual union of these peoples to make them the leading people of Europe. The political union was brought about by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, the spiritual union by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In the end these were combined into a form of theocracy which, by a rapid series of victories, conquered not only Southern Europe, but also Middle and Eastern Europe as well.

<p>Just as the fifth century passed into the sixth (481-511) <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, King of the Salian <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, forcibly subdued the most important of the surrounding tribes; he led them to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> after his own conversion. <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> first united what was left of the Roman Empire on the Seine and Loire with his own domain and made <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> his capital. After this he subdued the Alamanni on the Rhine, Mosel, Lower Main, and Neckar; as the champion of the doctrines of Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, he conquered the King of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> near Poitiers (507) and seized the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> territory between the Loire and the Garonne. By overthrowing the petty Salian chiefs and the royal family of the Ripuarian <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, he made himself the ruler of all the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> tribes. The work was completed by his four sons, who seized the territories of the Thuringians and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, forced the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> to give up Provence and Rhaetia, and obtained by treaties sovereignty over the Bajuvarii.

<p>Thus was laid the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franco</a>-Christian Empire which opened to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a new missionary field to be won over to the Faith only by properly trained apostles. The training was given in the monastic institutions which, in imitation of the East, had now spread over all of Western Europe. One of the chief factors in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> was the Order of <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict of Nursia</a>, encouraged by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>. The precursors of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> were <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> (432) and St. Columba (about 550), who converted <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, while the Anglo-Saxons received <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Augustine (596), who had been specially sent by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the death of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> there were in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, numerous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; his own see was Armagh. Columba founded the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Island of Iona, between <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, which was the centre of the Scotch missions and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The Abbot Augustine and his companions erected the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Sees of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (Durovernum), York (Eboracum), and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>; in the course of the seventh century the successors of Augustine, <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus</a> and Theodore of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, completed his work.

<p>A glorious band of self-sacrificing apostles of the Faith, from Columbanus and Gallus to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>, carried <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from the British Isles to the Continent. They founded their work on what scanty remains of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> still existed in the former Roman provinces. In the fifth century Severinus and Valentinus laboured in south-eastern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. They found the remains of nearly obliterated sees in Lorch, Pettau, Windisch in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, Basle, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, Avenches in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Martigny, and Geneva, but the Teutonic migrations and the disorders consequent on them had almost destroyed the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. About 610 Columbanus crossed the Vosges mountains, where he had founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Annegray and Luxeuil, and came to Lake Constance; here from Bregenz as a centre he preached <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, while his companion St. Gall became the founder of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gall. In the early part of the seventh century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> Agilus and Eustasius, of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a>, preached the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; they were followed by Rupert of Worms and Emmeram of Aquitaine. <a href="../cathen/04356a.htm">St. Corbinian</a> laboured as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, and Kilian in <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. Ecclesiastical life on the Rhine was largely developed by Bishops Nicetius of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Cunibert of Cologne, Dragobodo of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, Amandus, Lambert, and Hugo of Maastricht. The Gospel was brought to the Frisians by Wilfrid of York and Willibrord of Northumbria; the latter erected a see at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. Willibrord's companion, Suidbert, went into the countship of Mark in the region of the Weser, <a href="../cathen/09276a.htm">Lippe</a>, and Ruhr Rivers; the brothers Ewald laboured with little success among the Saxons. An organization including all these countries was not established until the appearance of the greatest of the apostles of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. He entered on his career in the time of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Mayors of the Palace, who were destined to realize the union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in Western Europe.

<p>Repeated divisions of the kingdom, disputes as to succession, civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and the power of the nobles almost brought the great <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom to dissolution. It was saved from utter ruin by Pepin of Heristal, Mayor of the Palace (<em>Major domus</em>), who gradually took control of the government. In 687 Pepin won for himself the position of Mayor of the Palace of Neustria and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, in addition to that for Austrasia which he already held; in this way he reunited the kingdom. He then undertook the conquest of the tribes which had broken loose from the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rule and encouraged the missions to the West Frisians. His son, <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, who was not less active, held a position of such power that he was able, in the great battle of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, 732, to protect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> German civilization against the attempt of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> to conquer the world. Pepin the Short, the son of Charles, brought about the union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> which had so great an influence on the history of the world. Having obtained the title of king in 752, his first task was to defend <a href="../cathen/14288b.htm">Pope Stephen II</a>, who had appealed to him for aid, from the attacks of the Lombards; this was followed by the so-called "Donation of Pepin," a grant of territory to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> which was the foundation of the later <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. Their mutual engagements fixed not only their own policy but also that of their successors. Like Pepin, his famous son, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, lent his support to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and all his conquests were undertaken for the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. By successful campaigns against Aquitaine, the Lombards, Avars, Saxons, and Danes, and by treaties with the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> increased his domain until it extended from the Ebro and the Apennines to the Eider River in Schleswig-Holstein, and from the Atlantic to the Elbe and the Raab. His kingdom became a world-empire and he himself one of the great rulers of history, worthy of reviving the Western Roman Empire. He was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 800, by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the new empire rested essentially on the basis of an alliance with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its ideal was the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> on earth, in which the emperor by Divine appointment is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> viceroy in order to lead and rule all races as divided into nations, classes, and distinctions of rank according to Divine will.

<p>Pepin the Short had been filled with this lofty conception; consequently extraordinary success attended the missionary labours of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under both rulers. As early as 716, under the rule of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, the Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Winfrid, better known as <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>, landed on the Continent; he was to be the reformer and organizer of German <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. He always laboured in union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was himself a missionary in Frisia with Willibrord, then, in 722, in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> and Thuringia, and in 736, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Having been made an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and having received authority from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he founded a number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, e.g., that of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, Buraburg, and Erfurt. By means of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held every five years he brought about the closer union between the old and new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and placed the newly founded sees in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, as well as those of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, Worms, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Tongern, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and Strasburg, under <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, of which he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 746. In the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> the large territories of the Saxons and Avars were added to the lands thus organized, and these new regions also received missionaries and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The result was the founding of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> (787), <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> (806), Werden, and Minden in the country of the Engern, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> and M&uuml;nster (785) in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, Halberstadt and Hildesheim (817) in Eastphalia; the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of all the Saxon sees was Bremen (834). The conversion of the Avars had been attempted by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Duke Tassilo II; when the East Mark was founded the Avars came under the influence of the sees and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> established in this country; after their subjugation they were placed partly under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and partly under that of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>.

<p>From these points, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, as formerly in the Roman Empire, extended beyond the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> dominions, and new tribes and peoples were evangelized, while, at the same time, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization was peacefully established within the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/04402a.htm">Corvey</a> on the Weser, and the Sees of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and Hamburg (831) were the mission centres for the northern provinces. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Anschar of Corvey, first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, laboured with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>; his successors were equally active as missionaries and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. However it was not until the reign of Canute the Great (1014-35) that the victory of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was assured; in 1104 Lund was made the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Scandinavia; in 1163 Upsala became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Sweden, and about the middle of the twelfth century Trondhjem was made the same for <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. Iceland was won for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> about the year 1000 and was divided into the two sees of Skalhold and Holum. The inhabitants of the Orkneys, Hebrides, Faroe, and Shetland Islands were converted about the same time as Iceland; they were at first placed under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Hamburg- Bremen, which had been united in 849, and later under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>.

<p>During the period of the Teutonic migrations the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> had come into contact with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and were converted partly by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rulers, as in Thrace, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, partly through the influence of neighbouring <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries, as in Carinthia. In 806 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> undertook the conversion of Moravia; that of Pannonia was attempted by Archbishop Adalram of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (821-36). In both these countries a great missionary work was done by Cyril and Methodius; the latter, Methodius, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and Pannonia. The work of converting <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> began in the year 845; the country was at first under the care of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>; in 973 a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was founded in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> itself at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, which was suffragan to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> was brought to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by its ruler Duke Mieczyslaw (963), and in 968 he erected the Bishopric of Posen. In the year 1000 Gnesen was made a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> were Kolberg (1065), Breslau (1000), and Cracow (1000). Finally, in the reigns of Heinrich I and <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> the northern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, living in regions subsequently German, namely the Wends, including those living in <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, as well as the Obotrites and Sorbs on the Oder, Vistula, and Elbe, in Lausitz, and Saxony were forcibly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a>. The new Sees of Havelberg, <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, Zeitz, Merseburg, and Oldenburg (Stargard) served as points from which the work of conversion could be carried on; Magdeburg was the centre of the entire Slavonic mission.

<p>It was during this same period that the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> spread through the eastern part of Europe. In 955 the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princess of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Olga, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Constantinople; during the reign of her grandson Vladimir, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> 989, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became the religion of the country. In 864 the Bulgars, at the command of their prince Bogoris, accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as a people, and from 870 were under the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control of Constantinople. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent from Constantinople introduced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> among the Magyars, or Hungarians; the work was completed by German missionaries sent in pursuance of the masterful policy of the Saxon emperors. The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ruler of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was Stephen (997-1038).

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, however, were still <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to keep what had been gained for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and to protect these gains against the threatened dangers of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. These <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were freely made by <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Europe. Under the careful training of their appointed guardians, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> orders, the various nations and their rulers were filled with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thoughts and feelings. Although the conception of their respective positions held by the human representatives of the secular and spiritual power inevitably led to friction, especially in the age of the Hohenstaufen emperors, nevertheless all were conscious of their common <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to protect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and civilization against foes both in Europe and outside of it. A convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this was the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> struggle of Europe against the attempted inroads of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, and especially the expeditions of conquest to the Holy Land repeatedly undertaken by the various nations of Europe acting together. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which since 711 had been almost entirely under the control of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, was able in 1212 to drive them as far back as <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>; in 1492 <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> also fell. From 878 <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> had been in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, but it was freed by the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> Normans (1061-91). The so-called <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> (1061-1244) continued with interruptions for nearly two hundred years; among those who shared in them were <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, as Peter of Amiens and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freising</a>; rulers of the greatest nations of Western Europe, as the German emperors, <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>; the French kings, St. Louis and Philip II, and the English <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard the Lion-Hearted</a>. Orders of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, as the Order of St. John, were formed to take part in these expeditions. The original aim of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, the freeing of Palestine from the control of non-Christians, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, was not attained. But the power of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> was weakened for a long time to come; the civilization of Western Europe, moreover, gained from the Orient the best the East had to give and thus was greatly aided in its development.

<p>A more lasting success, however, followed the attempts, patterned on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, to carry on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of conversion and conquest in those territories of northeastern Europe peopled by tribes that had lapsed from the Faith or that were still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; among such <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were the Obotrites, <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomeranians</a>, Wiltzi, Sorbs, Letts, Livonians, <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>. The preparatory work was done in the twelfth century by missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Orders. They were aided with armed forces by Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony, Albert the Bear of Brandenburg, Boleslaw of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and St. Erik IX of Sweden. From the beginning of the thirteenth century <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> were undertaken against Livonia, Semgall, a division of the present Courland, and Esthonia; <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> conquered <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> after a struggle that lasted more than fifty years. In Lithuania <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> did not win the victory until 1368. After this only the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, in the south-eastern corner of the Continent, were a cause of alarm to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Europe for centuries. The decline of the power of the Eastern Empire drew the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> over the Bosporus; in 1365 they had control of <a href="../cathen/01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>; in the course of the fourteenth century the Serbs, Bulgars, Macedonians, and the inhabitants of Thessaly became their subjects. In 1453 the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> took Constantinople, in 1461 Trebizond, in 1480 even <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a> in Apulia; after 1547 they owned half of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. It was not until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that their possessions were reduced to their present boundaries, thus limiting <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> to a small part of the population of Europe.

<p>At the beginning of modern times a great change took place in the boundaries of the European States. The cause was that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> movement known as the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which placed in opposition to the unity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Western Europe the numerous religious associations that together form <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The apostasy of the various countries and cities, which began soon after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> first appeared, was brought about by the most varied causes, described elsewhere, and was facilitated by the violent procedure of the petty princes who had absolute sovereign power over their subjects. The first of the ruling princes to make the change was <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, Grand Master of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> (1525); he was followed by the Elector John of Saxony, Philip, Landgrave of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> (1527), and at almost the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> by nearly all the German imperial cities. The movement soon gained the northern countries, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and the Baltic provinces; these all gave their adherence (1530) to the so-called Augsburg Confession, while the upper German imperial cities, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Lindau, Memmingen, held to the Tetrapolitan Confession of the so-called Reformed Church founded by <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> and especially strong in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The Reformed Church also found adherents in the Palatinate, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century in Hesse-Cassel and Brandenburg. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> was established in 1549 in Great Britain; in 1559 the French Reformed Church adopted the "Confessio Gallicana"; in 1560 the Scotch Reformed the "Confessio Scottica"; from 1592 the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> adopted a <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> form of government. Since 1562 the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> has held to the "Confessio Belgica," and the Reformed Church in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> since 1567, to the "Confessio Hungarica." Soon the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, called into life by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-63) to prevent the loss of the whole of middle Europe, appeared; its success was assured by the aid of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. In this way various princes and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were desirous of doing their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> were enabled to hold their countries to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the Duke of Cleves, the Electors of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Basle, the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, but especially the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the Hapsburg dynasty within their Austrian provinces. Soon the hostility between the two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> parties grew so bitter that a trifling incident sufficed to bring on a terrible religious conflict, the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> (1616-48). Two religious confessional leagues confronted each other in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>: the Catholic League, which was formed in 1609 among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> States of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> and had for its leader the vigorous Duke Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and the Union in which, from 1609, most of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and cities combined under the leadership of Frederick IV of the Palatinate. Foreign powers &#151; <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> &#151; also took part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The result of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, confirmed in the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, laid the foundation of confessional relations as they now exist. Neither internal commotions nor seemingly mighty political revolutions, such as the illuminism of the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">French Encyclopedists</a> and the German neo-classicists, the temporary supremacy of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, with its consequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, greatly changed these relations. The present condition as developed during the course of the nineteenth century and up to the present time is as follows.
<h2>Present condition of religion in Europe</h2>
<h3 id="A">Relations of the different states to the religious communions</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> the formation of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> and their religious worship are subject to the legislation of the several States. Some States allow complete freedom, as <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha; others supervise religious worship, as Baden, <a href="../cathen/15527a.htm">Waldeck</a>, and Mecklenburg; others again make the establishment of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> depend on the Government, as in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, <a href="../cathen/13495a.htm">Saxe-Meiningen</a>, and Alsace-Lorraine. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the Evangelical Churches are regarded as privileged and public corporations. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> is the State Church, its head being the king; the fundamental principles are defined by Parliament. There is a similar arrangement for the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> State Church in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> where, however, the organization is somewhat freer. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is, since 1869, no longer a State Church. The Dissenters, who in 1689 were only conditionally tolerated, have now equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the Separation Law of 9 December, 1905, brought about the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> and provided for the formation of <em>Associations cultuelles</em> for the exercise of religion. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the Constitution originally declared the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> religion the religion of the State, but gradually all privileges have been withdrawn from it; besides the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>, the Evangelical <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensian</a> Church, the National <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> and the Jewish communities are organized as Churches with separate constitutions. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the State religion is the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, Jewish, and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> forms of worship are recognized by the granting of salaries from the State to those having <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charges. Outside of these any <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community is a private association. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> grants equal protection to all confessions. So does <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, excepting that in this country a more exacting control is exercised over the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>. In <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> the <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Evangelical Lutheran Church</a> is the State Church, at least inasmuch as its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are paid by the State and subject to removal by the State; other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities have no claim to state support. The case is the same in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, where, in addition, the condition is laid down that the king, the members of the Council of State, and foreigners who are appointed teachers at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, all subscribe to some evangelical confession. ln <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> this ordinance is enforced for the head of the State. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the Churches and religious associations recognized by law are as follows: the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Greek</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Churches, the Evangelical Churches of the Augsburg and Helvetic Confessions, the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, the religious association of the Russian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Lipovani and the Oriental <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> in Bukowina, the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, and the Moravian Brethren (<em>Herrnhuter</em>). The expenses of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek</a> Churches are met from a fund controlled by the State and obtained from the secularization of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">Church property</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> was originally the state religion; the State grants in addition free exercise to other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> confessions and to the Jewish <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Croatia-Slavonia recognizes only the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Greek</a> Churches, the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Churches, and the Jewish <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In Bosnia and Herzegovina the ruling confessions are the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek</a> and <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> Churches, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>.

<h3 id="B">Organization of the religious communions</h3>

<p>The Evangelical Church distinguishes three forms of organization: (a) The episcopal, in which the ruler of the country with the aid of a subordinate <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> exercises <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. This is the form in force in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and Finland. (b) The consistorial organization, in which the ruler is aided by a consistory made up of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular members. This form is found in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxony-Altenburg, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Schwarzburg-Sonderhausen, the two principalities of <a href="../cathen/12799b.htm">Reuss</a>, <a href="../cathen/13523c.htm">Schaumburg-Lippe</a>, <a href="../cathen/09401a.htm">L&uuml;beck</a>, <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01341c.htm">Alsace-Lorraine</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. (c) The synodal form of organization and similar <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> associations which are based on assemblies of elected representatives and the ordinances passed by these. This form of organization is in existence in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and other German States, where the consistorial system is not in force. The synodal organization also exists among the non-Anglican Churches in Great Britain, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, among the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; also in connexion with the episcopal form of church government in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and Finland. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, called in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church of England</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, is episcopal in government; in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the episcopal and synodal systems are united. The head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the king. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> are divided into the two church provinces of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of All <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; under Canterbury are 28 suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; York consists of an archdiocese and 9 suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> has 2 <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>: Armagh, which has the primacy of all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and Dublin with 10 suffragans; <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> has 7 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The organization of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> varies in different countries. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the Tsar, who appoints the members of the Holy Synod, the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> body. In Turkey the Oecumenical Patriarch is the head; under him are 10 or 12 <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. In Rumania a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> is the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; in Servia a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> the church government is vested in an <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, aided by <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and archpriests. The Holy Synod of Greece consists of five <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> named by the king. In the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Monarchy there are 3 provinces of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>: the Austrian, or Province of Czernowitz, with the suffragan Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> and Cattaro, the Archdiocese of Karlowitz (<a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a>-<a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>), with 6 suffragans, and the Archdiocese of Herrmannstadt, with 2 suffragans. Bosnia and Herzegovina have each a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>.
