<h1>Eusebius Amort</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Bibermuehle in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 15 November, 1692; d. at Polling, 5 February, 1775. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and at an early age joined the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Polling, where he spent most of his life as a teacher of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and canon law, a tireless student in many departments of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lore, and an investigator of natural phenomena. He was foremost among the German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the eighteenth century as a guide and an inspirer of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> youth, and may be considered a model of lifelong devotion to all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> that befit an <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastic</a>. As early as 1722 he founded, and with some interruptions carried on for several years, an influential review, "Parnassus Boicus, oder Neuer&ouml;ffneter Musenberg." An academy formed by him at Polling became in time the model on which was based the Academy of Sciences of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. He spent the years 1733-35 at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence he returned to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> enriched with precious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired by intense study in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> and by intercourse with many learned men. Thenceforth he counted among his correspondents such scholars as <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04191a.htm">Father Concina</a>, Cardinals Leccari, Galli, <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Orsi</a>, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, and others. For a period of forty years his pen was never idle, and from it unceasingly poured forth learned volumes and brochures filled with rare and choice learning.

<p>It has been truly said that his seventy volumes, if distributed in an orderly collection, would resemble a general encyclopedia. As a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, he is best known by his solid work "Philosophia Pollingana" (Augsburg, 1730) and by his "Wolfiana Judicia de philosophi&acirc; et Leibnitian&acirc; physic&acirc;" (Frankfurt, 1736). As a <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> he won applause by his "Demonstratio critica religionis catholicae nova, modesta, facilis" etc. (Venice, 1744), written to promote the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by his "De origine, progressu, valore et fructu indulgentiarum accurata notitia historica, dogmatica, critica" (Augsburg, 1735). His most extensive work, "Theologia eclectica, moralis et scholastica," published at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (1752) in four folio volumes, and later at Bologna (1753) in twenty-four octavo volumes, merited the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a revision by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. He wrote also "Theologia moralis inter rigorem et laxitatem media" (Augsburg, 1739), "Ethica Christiana" (Augsburg, 1758), and other moral treatises. <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> admired his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07089a.htm">Gury</a> calls him a "probabilista moderatus doctrina et sapientia clarus"; others (e.g. Toussaint) accuse him of an inclination to rigorism in practice. He translated into Latin the "Dictionnaire des cas de conscience" of Pontas (Venice, 1733), but modified its Gallican tone and rigoristic views.

<p>Of his canonical works the most important is his "Vetus Disciplina canonicorum et regularium" (Venice, 1748), "Elementa juris canonici veteris et moderni" (Ulm, 1757), both valuable for their wealth of historical material. In the latter he defends <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> against the attacks of contemporary jurists and statesmen. The best known of his works is entitled "De revelationibus, visionibus et apparitionibus privatis regulae tutae ex Scriptur&acirc;, Conciliis, Sanctis Patribus aliisque optimis auctoribus collectae, explicatae atque exemplis illustratae (Augsburg, 1744). It was directed against the "Mystic City of God," the famous work of the Spanish <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, <a href="../cathen/01229a.htm">Maria de Agreda</a>, and brought him into conflict with several of her <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> defenders. This learned scholar found time to prepare for the people a number of devotional works. His <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-books</a>, "Kurz und Gut" and "Brevier eines guten Christen," went through many editions. He also compiled select lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and wrote a German treatise (Venice, 1756) on the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, besides a smaller and a larger <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. In the discussions waged during the first half of the eighteenth century concerning the authorship of the "De Imitatione Christi," Amort stood forth as an ardent supporter of the claims of <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, though his seven works on the subject, praised for their "rare learning and judicious temper," failed to silence the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> champions of Jean Gersen. The more important are: "Scutum Kempense" (Cologne, 1725); "Plen&acirc; et succinct&acirc; informatio de statu totius controversiae" (Augsburg, 1725), and "Certitudo moralis pro Th. Kempensi" (Ratisbon, 1764). On his portrait by Jungwirth was engraved "Litterarum maxime sacrarum per Bavariam restaurator eximius." The visitor to Bibermuehle may now contemplate a marble monument in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> in whom industry, erudition, critical skill, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> were united in a high degree.
