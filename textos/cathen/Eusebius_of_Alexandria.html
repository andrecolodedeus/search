<h1>Eusebius of Alexandria</h1>  

<p>Ecclesiastical writer and author of a number of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> well known in the sixth and seventh centuries and of much ascetical and dogmatic value. There has been much dispute regarding the details of his life and the age in which he lived. <a href="../cathen/06349b.htm">Galland</a> (Vet. Patr. Biblioth., VIII, 23) says: "de Eusebio qui vulgo dicitur episcopus Alexandr&aelig; incerta omnia" (Concerning Eusebius, commonly called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> there is nothing sure). His writings have been attributed to Eusebius of <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a>, and others. According to an old biography said to have been written by his notary, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> John, and discovered by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a>, he lived in the fifth century and led a monastic life near Alexandria. The fame of his virtues attracted the attention of Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, who visited him with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and in 444, when dying, had him elected his successor, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though much against his will. Eusebius displayed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the exercise of his office and did much good by his preaching. Among those he converted was a certain Alexander, a man of senatorial rank. After having ruled his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for seven or, according to another account, for twenty years, he made Alexander his successor and retired to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, whence Cyril had summoned him and there died in the odor of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.

<p>While <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> seems to have established the existence of a Eusebius of Alexandria who lived in the fifth century, it had been objected than neither the name of Eusebius or his successor Alexander, appears in the list of the occupants of that ancient see. <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> is mentioned as the immediate successor of Cyril. Nor does the style of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> seem on the whole in keeping with the age of Cyril. It may be noted, however, that the biographer of Eusebius expressly states that the Cyril in question is the great opponent of Nestorius. Various solution of the difficulty have been proposed. Thilo (Ueber die Schriften des Eusebius v. Alexandrian U. des Eusebius von Emesa, Halle, 1832) thinks that the authorship of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> is to be assigned either to a certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> &mdash; one of four brothers &#51; of the fifth century, or to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Justinian I, who took an active part in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> strifes of the sixth century. <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> suggests that after the death of Cyril, there were two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> leader, and Eusebius, the head of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. The <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> cover a variety of subjects, and the author is one of the earliest patristic witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/07143d.htm">descent of Christ into Hell</a>. A list of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> with the complete text is given by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> (Spicilegium Romanum IX). They may also be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., LXXXVI. The "Sermo de Confusione Diaboli" was published with an introduction by Rand in "Modern Philology", II, 261.
