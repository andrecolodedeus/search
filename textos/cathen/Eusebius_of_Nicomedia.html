<h1>Eusebius of Nicomedia</h1>  

<p>Bishop, place and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 341. He was a pupil at Antioch of <a href="../cathen/09409a.htm">Lucian the Martyr</a>, in whose famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he learned his <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> doctrines. He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Berytus; but from ambitious motives he managed to get transferred, contrary to the canons of the early Church, to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, the residence of the Eastern Emperor Licinius, with whose wife, <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a>, sister of Constantine, he was in high favor.

<p>Arius, when he was condemned at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, by Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see, took refuge at Ca&aelig;sarea, where he was well received by the famous <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> and historian <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, and wrote to Eusebius of Nicomedia for support. The letter is preserved. In it the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> explains his views clearly enough, and appeals to his correspondent as to a "fellow Lucianist". Eusebius put himself at the head of the party, and wrote many letters in support of Arius. One is preserved, addressed to Paulinius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. We learn from it what Eusebius's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was at this time: the Son he says is "not generated from the substance of the Father", but He is "other in nature and power"; He was created, and this is not inconsistent with his Sonship, for the wicked are called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/isa001.htm#vrs2">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#vrs18">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>) and so are even the drops of dew (<a href="../bible/job038.htm#vrs28">Job 38:28</a>); He was begotten by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. This is pure <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, borrowed from the letters of Arius himself, and possibly more definite than the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of St. Lucian.

<p>Alexander of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to address a circular to all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He had hoped, he says, to cover the matter in silence, "but Eusebius, who is now at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, considering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> affairs to be in his hands, because he has not been condemned for having left Berytus and for having coveted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Nicomediam is the leader of these <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, and has sent round a document in their support, in order that he might seduce some of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> into this disgraceful <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. . . . If Eusebius should write to you, pay no attention". Eusebius replied by assembling a council in his own province, which begged all the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to communicate with Arius, and to use their influence with Alexander in his favor. At the request of Arius, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a> and others met together in Palestine, and authorized him to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which he had governed in Alexandria.

<p>The situation changed when Constantine had conquered Licinius in 323. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor began by comprising Arius and Alexander in common disapproval. Why could not they agree to differ about subtleties of this kind, as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> did? A letter in this sense to the patriarch was ineffectual; so Constantine preferred the side of authority, and wrote an angry rebuke to Arius. In the case of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, he had obtained a decision from a "general" council, at Arles of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his then dominions. He now summoned a larger council, from around the world of which his victorious arms had made him master. It met at Nic&aelig;a in 325. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were nearly all Easterns; but a Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a>, who was in the emperor's confidence, took a leading part, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was represented. Constantine ostentatiously declared at the council went no further than the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a> makes it clear that he spoke on the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and his friends put forward an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but it had only about seventeen supporters from among three hundred members of the council, and it was hooted by the majority. The formula which was eventually adopted was resisted for some time by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> contingent, but eventually all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed, with the exception of the two Egyptians who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by Alexander.

<p>Eusebius of Nicomedia had bad luck. Though he had signed the creed, he had not agreed to the condemnation of Arius, who had been, so he said, misrepresented; and after the council he encouraged in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> some <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> whom Constantine had invited to Constantinople with a view to their conversion. Three months after the council, the Emperor sent him like Arius into exile, together with Theognis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nic&aelig;a, accusing him of having been a supporter of Licinius, and of even having approved of his persecutions, as well as of having sent spies to watch himself. But the banishment of the intriguer lasted only two years. It is said that it was Constantia, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Licinius, who induced Constantine to recall Arius, and it is probable that she was also the cause of the return of her old friend Eusebius. By 329 he was in high favor with the emperor with whom he may have had some kind of a relationship, since Ammianus Marcellinus makes him a relative of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>.



<p>From this time onward we find Eusebius at the head of a small and compact party called, by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, the Eusebians <em>peri ton Eusebion</em>, whose object it was to undo the work of Nic&aelig;a, and to procure the complete victory of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. They did not publicly recall the signatures that had been forced from them. They explained that Arius had repented on any excess in his words, or had been misunderstood. They dropped the Nicene formul&aelig; as ambiguous. They were the leaders of a much larger party of conservative <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, who wished to stand well with the emperor, who reverenced the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Lucian and the great <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and were seriously alarmed at any danger of <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>. The campaign opened with a successful attack on Eustathius of Antioch, the principal <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the East properly so called. He had been having an animated controversy with <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a>, in which he had accused that learned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> retorted with a charge of <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>. Eustathius was deposed and exiled, for alleged disrespectful expressions about the emperor's mother, St. Helena, who was greatly devoted to the memory of St. Lucian. It is said he was also charged with immorality and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the whole case was got up by the Eusebians. The great see of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was filled in 328 by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, who had taken a leading part in Nic&aelig;a. Small in stature, and young in years, he was at the head of a singularly united body of nearly a hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and his energy and vivacity, his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and determination marked him out as the one foe the Eusebians had to dread. The Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> had now signed an ambiguous formula of submission, and Eusebius of Nicomedia wrote to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, asking him to reinstate them, adding a verbal message of threats. The Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, had only been partially healed by the mild measures decreed at Nic&aelig;a, and the schismatics were giving trouble. Constantine was induced by Eusebius to write to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> curtly telling him he should be deposed, if he refused to receive into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> any who demanded to be received. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> explained why he could not do this, and the emperor seems to have been satisfied. Eusebius then joined hands with the Meletians, and induced them to trump up charges against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. They first pretended that he had invented a tribute of linen garments, which he extracted. This was disproved, but Athanasiuis himself was sent for to the court. The Meletians then brought up a charge which did <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for many years, that he had ordered a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Macaarius to overturn an altar and break up a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> belonging to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Ischyras, in the Mareotis, though in fact Ischyras had never been a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and at the time alleged could not have been pretending to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, for he was ill in bed. It was also said the <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had assisted a certain Philumenus to conspire against the emperor, and had given him a bag of gold. Again the accusers were refuted and put to flight. The saint returned to his Church with a letter from Constantine, in which the emperor sermonized the Alexandrians after his wont, urging them to peace and unity. But the question of the broken <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> was not dropped and the Meletians further got hold of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Arsenius, whom they kept in hiding while they declared that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had put him to death; they carried about a severed hand, which they said was Arsenius's cut off by the patriarch for the purpose of magic. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> induced Ischyras to sign a document denying the former charge, and managed to discover the whereabouts of Arsenius. Constantine in consequence wrote a letter to the patriarch declaring him innocent.

<p>Eusebius had stood apart from all these <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusations, and he was not disheartened by so many failures. He got the Meletians to demand a synod, and represented to Constantine that it would be right for peace to be obtained before the assembling of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to celebrate the dedication of the new Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This was in 335. A synod met at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, whose history need not be detailed here. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> brought some fifty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with him, but they had not been summoned, and were not allowed to sit with the rest. A deputation was sent to Mareotis to inquire into the question of Ischyras and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and the chief enemies of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> were chosen for the purpose. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> was tumultuous, and even the Count Dionysius, who had come with soldiers to support the Eusebians thought the proceedings unfair. It remains a mystery how so many well-meaning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were deceived into condemning <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. He refused to await their judgement. Extricating himself with difficulty from the assembly, he led away his Egyptians, and betook himself directly to Constantinople, where he accosted the emperor abruptly, and demanded <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. At his suggestion, the Coucil of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> was ordered to come before the emperor. Meanwhile Eusebius had brought the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on to Jerusalem, where the deliberations were made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> by the reception back into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the followers off Arius. The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had drawn up a protest, attributing all that had been done at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> to a conspiracy between Eusebius and the Meletians and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> asserts that the final act at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had been Eusebius's aim all along; all the accusations against himself had tended to get him out of the road in order that the rehabilitation of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> might be effected.

<p>Eusebius prevented any of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from going to Constantinople, save those he could trust, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a>, Theognis of Nic&aelig;a, Patrophilus of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a> and the two young Pannonian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, who were to continue Eusebius's policy long after his death. They carefully avoided renewing the accusations of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and sacrilege, which Constantine had already examined; and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> tells us that five <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reported to him that they rested their case on a new charge, that he had threatened to delay the corn ships from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> which supplied Constantinople. The emperor was enraged. No opportunity of defense was given, and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was banished to Gaul. But in public, Constantine said that he had put in force the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. Constantine the Younger, however, declared later that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had intended to save <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> from his enemies by sending him away, and that before dying he had had the intention of restoring him. The leader of the Meletians John Arkaph, was similarly exiled. Eusebius wanted him no further, and hence did not care to protect him. One triumph was yet wanting to Eusebius, the reconciliation of Arius, his friend. This was to be consummated at length at Constantinople, but the designs of man were frustrated by the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Arius died suddenly under peculiarly humiliating conditions on the eve of the day appointed for his solemn restoration to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of New Rome.

<p>Until 337 the Eusebians were busy obtaining, by <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who supported the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Of these the best known are Paul of Constantinople, Aselepas of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and Marcellus <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>. In the case of Marcellus they had received considerable provocation. Marcellus had been their active enemy at Nic&aelig;a. At <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> he had refused to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and he presented a book to the emperor in which the Eusebians received harsh words. He was convicted, not without grounds, of Sabellianizing, and took refuge in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 22 May, 337 <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> died at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, after having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place. His brothers and all but two of his nephews were at once <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, in order to simplify the succession, and the world was divided between his three sons.

<p>Arrangement was effected between them by which all the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> returned, and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> came back to his flock. Eusebius was in reality a gainer by the new regime. Constantius, who was now Lord of all the East, was but twenty years old. He wished to manage the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he seems to have fallen a prey to the arts of the old intriguer Eusebius, so that the rest of his foolish and obstinate life was spent in persecuting <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and in carrying out Eusebius's policy. Never himself an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, Constantius held <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> to lie somewhere between <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who were ready to disguise their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to some extent, were therefore able to obtain from him a favor, which he denied to the few uncompromising <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who rejected his generalities.

<p>The see of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> had remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> during the absence of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. Eusebius now claimed to put the Synod of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> in force, and a rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was set up in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Pistus, one of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom Alexander had long ago <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Until now the East alone had been concerned. The Eusebians were the first to try to get <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the West on their side. They sent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and embassy of two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who carried with them the decisions of the council of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and the supposed <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> of which the accused himself had been unable to get a sight. Instead of at once granting his communion to Pistus, Pope Julius sent the documents to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, in order that he might prepare a defense. The latter summoned a council of his suffragans. More than eighty attended, and sent Julius a complete defense of their patriarch. The arrival of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius's</a> envoys bearing his letter struck terror into the minds of the ambassadors of the Eusebians. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> fled, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> could think of nothing better than to beg Julius to call a council, and be judge himself. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> consented on the grounds that in the case of one of the chief churches, such as Alexandria, it was right and customary that the matter should be referred to him. He therefore wrote summoning both the accusers and the accused to a council of which he was willing that they should determine the place and time.

<p>Thus it was not <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> who appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but the Eusebians, and that simply as a means of withdrawing from an awkward predicament. Pistus was not a success, and Constantius introduced by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> a certain Gregory, a Cappadocian, in his place. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, after addressing a protest to the whole Church against the methods of Eusebius, managed to escape with his life, and at once made his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obey the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> summons. His accusers took good care not to appear. Julius wrote again, fixing the end of the year (339) as the term for their arrival. They detained the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> until the fixed time had elapsed, and sent them back in January 340, with a letter full of studied and ironical politeness, of which <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> had preserved us the tenor. He says:

<blockquote><p>Having assembled at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, they wrote an answer to Julius, elaborately worded and rhetorically composed, full of irony, and containing terrible threats. They admitted in this letter that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was always honored as the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Apostles, and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the Faith from the beginning, although its teachers had settled in it form the East. But they thought that they ought not to take a secondary place because they had less great and populous churches, since they were superior in virtue and intention. They reproached Julius with having communicated with <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and complained that this was an insult to their synod, and that their condemnation of him was made null; and they urged that this was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and contrary to ecclesiastical law. After thus reproaching Julius of ill usage, they promised, if he would accept the deposition of those whom they had deposed, and the appointment of those whom they had <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, to grant him peace and communion, but if he withstood their decrees, they would refuse to do so. For they declared that the earlier Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had made no objection when <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> was driven out of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. But they wrote nothing to Julius concerning their acts, which were contrary to the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>, saying that they many <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> reasons to allege in excuse, but that it was superfluous to make any defense against a vague and general suspicion that they had done wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>The traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had been schooled by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and had always been the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the Faith is interesting in the mouths of those who were denying his right to interfere in the East, in a matter of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; for it is to be remembered that neither then, or at any time, was <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. This claim of independence is a first sign of the breach which began with the foundation of Constantinople as New Rome, and which ended in the complete separation of that city and all its dependencies from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion. For Eusebius had not contented himself with Nicomedia, now that it was no longer the capital, but managed to get St. Paul of Constantinople exiled once more, and had seized upon that see, which was evidently, in his view, to be set above Alexandria or Antioch, and to be in very deed a second <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The Roman council met in the autumn of 340. The Eusebians were not represented, but many Easterns, their victims, who had taken refuge at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, were there from Thrace, C&oelig;ls-Syria, Ph&oelig;nicia and Palestine, besides <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and Marcellus. Deputies came to complain of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Others explained that many <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had wished to come, but had been prevented and even beaten or <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. At the wish of the council the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote a long letter to the Eusebians. It is one of the finest letters written by any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and lays bare all the deceits of Eusebius, which is as unsparing as it is dignified. It is probably that the letter did not trouble Eusebius much, safe as he was in the emperor's favor. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that by the death of Constantine II, Constans, the protector of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, had inherited his dominions, and was now far more powerful than Constantius. But, Eusebius had never posed as an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and in 341 he had a fresh, triumph in the great Dedication Synod of Antioch, where a large number of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and conservative <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ignored the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>, and showed themselves quite at one with the Eusebian party; though denying they were ever followers of Arius, who was not even a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>!

<p>Eusebius died, full of years and honors, probably soon after the council; At all events he was dead before that of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>. He had arrived at the summit of his hopes. He may really have believed <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but clearly his chief aim had ever been his own aggrandizement, and the humiliation of those who had humbled him at Nic&aelig;a. He had succeeded. His enemies were in exile. His creatures satin the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch. He was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the imperial city, and the young emperor obeyed his counsels. If Epiphanius is right in calling him an old man even before Nic&aelig;a he must now have reached a great age. His work lived after him. He had trained a group of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who continued his intrigues, and who followed the court from place to place throughout the reign of Constantius. More than this, it may be said that the world suffers to this day from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wrought by this worldly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
