<h1>Eustathius of Sebaste</h1>  

<p>Born about 300; died about 377. He was one of the chief founders of monasticism in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and for a long time was an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>. He was censured because of the exaggerated asceticism of his followers, hesitated all his life between various forms of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and finally became a leader of the <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachians</a> condemned by the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">First Council of Constantinople</a> (381). Eustathius was apparently the son of Eulalius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> (the Roman province). He studied under Arius (Basil, Ep. cxxxiii, 3; cxxliv, 3; cxlxiii, 3), and was known from the beginning as one who sympathized with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and then founded a community of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Partly because of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> common at that time (Fortescue, The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, London, 1908, pp. 57, 94) that no one could be both a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and partly also because of the extravagance of his community, he was suspended from his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by a synod at Neo-C&aelig;sarea. Late, in 340, a synod at <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangra</a> condemned his followers (<em>to&#249;s per&#236; Eust&aacute;thion</em>) for exaggerated and extravagant asceticism. These <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> forbade marriage for any one, refused to communicate with married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and taught that no married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can be saved; they <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and would not do so on the appointed fast-days; they claimed special grace for their own conventicles and dissuaded people from attending the regular services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was evidently a movement like that of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a> and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. Against these abuses the council drew up twenty canons, but without directly censuring Eustathius (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Conciliengesch.", 1st ed., II, 777 sq.; Braun, "Die Abhaltung der Synode von Gangra" in "Hist. Jahrb.", 1895, pp. 586 sq.). <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (<a href="../fathers/26013.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.14.36</a>) says that Eustathius submitted to this council and gave up his eccentricities. However, a synod at Antioch (341?) condemned him again for "perjury" (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, IV, xxiv, 9), perhaps because he had broken his promise made on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. About the year 356 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>. St. Basil was at that time (357-358) studying the life of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> before founding his own community at Amnesus, and he was much attracted by Eustathius's reputation as a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> leader of monasticism. For years, till about 372 or so, Basil believed in and defended his friend. But Eustathius was anything but a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Once, apparently in 366, he persuaded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, 352-366) of his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> by presenting a confession of the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, IV, xii); otherwise he wavered between every kind of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">semi-Arianism</a> and signed all manner of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and contradictory formul&aelig;. In 385 a synod at <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Melitene</a> deposed him, it seems rather for the old question of his rigorism than for <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Meletius (later the famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>) succeeded him at <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> still acknowledged Eustathius. He wandered about, was present at many <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (at <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> in 359, later at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>, Pamphylia, etc.&mdash;Socrates, IV, xii, 8), and signed many formul&aelig;. If one can speak of any principle in so inconsistent a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, it would seem that Eustathius was generally on the side of one of the forms of <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arianism</a>, opposed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the one hand and to extreme <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> on the other. St. Basil found him out and broke with him definitively at last (about 372 or 373). By this time Eustathius had taken up the cause of the people who denied the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> nature of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26012.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.45.6</a>; Basil, Ep. cciii, 3). We hear of him last about 377; he was then a very old man (Basil, Ep. cciv, 4; xxiii, 3). Besides his activity as a founder of monasticism in Roman <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Paphlagonia (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, III, xiv, 36, Eustathius had merit as an organizer of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, builder of almshouses, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, refuges, etc. (Epiphanius, H&aelig;r., lxxv, 1; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, III, xiv, 36).
