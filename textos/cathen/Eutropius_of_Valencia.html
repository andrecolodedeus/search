<h1>Eutropius of Valencia</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; d. about 610. He was originally a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <em>Monasterium Servitanum</em>, generally believed to have been situated in the province of Valencia, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It was founded some time in the sixth century by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Donatus who had been driven from Roman Africa during one of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> persecutions. The rule he introduced must have been based on that in use among the African <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, which has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the members of this community to be connected with the Augustinians, without, however, sufficient warrant. The <em>Monasterium Servitanum</em> is known only through the references of Sts. Isidore and Ildephonsus to its founder and one of his disciples, Eutropius, who succeeded as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>.

<p>Eutropius is known as the author of three letters, one to Licinianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthagena, and two to Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Iturbica. In the first, which has been lost, he inquires the reason for anointing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> children with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a>. This letter is known through St. Isidore. The same saint mentions a letter to Bishop Peter, the text of which has been preserved, which he says every <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> should read. The title is "De destructione monachorum et ruina monasteriorum". In response to a suggestion of some candidates for his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, he points out that the number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is a small matter compared with their earnestness. He may be criticized for his severity in enforcing the rule and in reprimanding the guilty, but he can easily justify himself, as his whole care consists in applying the rules the founders of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> laid down. And thus the reproaches made against him fall back on their authors. In any case he will not swerve from his course; he is indifferent to the criticisms of men. He cannot allow the faults of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to go unchecked. The Scriptures and the Fathers agree that correction is one of the first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of him who is charged with the guidance of others, and negligence on this head would only lead to serious irregularities. The second letter to Bishop Peter touches on the seven deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Like Cassian, Eutropius enumerates eight: <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sadness, faint-heartedness, vanity, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. He analyzes them, traces the links that unite them, and emphasizes their results. A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should resist these enemies with all his strength, persuaded that of himself he cannot be victorious, but that he needs the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As Eutropius develops his thought the teaching of Cassian becomes more and more evident. Eutropius was still at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> when he wrote these letters. It was not till 589 that he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, and his death cannot be set down earlier than 610. These are the dates found in Florez. Nothing is known of his work during his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>. Historians have usually called him saint, but it does not appear that he was ever <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cult. His letters are to be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "P.L.", LXXX, 9-20.
