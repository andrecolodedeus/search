<h1>Evangeliaria</h1>  

<p>Liturgical books containing those portions of the Gospels which are read during Mass or in the public offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The name does not date back earlier than the seventeenth century. The Greeks called such collections <em>Euaggelion</em>, "Gospel", or <em>eklogadion tou euaggeliou</em>, "Selections from the Gospel".

<p>The collection of readings from the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> and the Epistles known as <em>Apostolos</em>, "Apostle", or <em>praxapostolos</em>. In churches of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, the lessons from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the Epistles from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and portions of the Gospels are usually grouped in the same book under the name <em>Comes, Liber comitis, Liber comicus</em> (from <em>comes</em>, companion), or <em>Lectionarium</em>. Separate Evangeliaria are seldom to be met with in Latin. Tables indicating passages to be read, as well as the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days on which they are to be read, are called by the Greeks "Evangelistarium", a name sometimes given to the Evangeliaria proper; they are also called "Synaxarium", and by the Latins are known as "Capitulare". Although the word <em>Evangeliarium</em> is of recent origin, it has been universally adopted. The word <em>Lectioniarium</em> is employed, however, to denote either the collection of passages from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, including the Gospels, or else these passages alone without the corresponding Gospels.
<h3>Origin and use of evangeliaria</h3>

<p>Following the custom of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>, the Scriptures of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were read at the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> assemblies. According as the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">Canon of the New Testament</a> was decided on, certain extracts from it were included in these readings. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> tells us that in his day, when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> met together, they read the Memoirs of the Apostles and the writings of the Prophets (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter67"><em>First Apology</em> 67</a>). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and other writers bear witness to the same custom; and in the West the order of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> existed as early as the third century. For want of precise testimony we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the particular passages were decided on. Most likely the presiding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> chose them at the assembly itself; and it is obvious that on the occurrence of certain festivals the Scripture relating to them would be read. Little by little a more or less definite list would naturally result from this method. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> delivered at Antioch exhorts his hearers to read beforehand the Scripture passages to be read and commented on in the Office of the day (Homilia de Lazaro, iii, c. i). In like manner other Churches would form a table of readings. In the margin of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> text it was customary to note the Sunday or festival on which that particular passage would be read, and at the end of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, the list of such passages, the Synaxarium or Capitulare, would be added. Transition from this process to the making of an Evangeliarium, or collection of all such passages, was easy. Gregory is of opinion that we possess fragments of Evangeliaria in Greek <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, and that we have very many from the ninth century onwards (according to Gregory they number 1072). In like manner, we find Lectionaries in the Lain Churches as early as the fifth century. The Comes of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> dates from before <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (P.L., XXX, 487-532). From the tenth century onwards we find the Gospel lessons, together with the Epistles and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, united in a new <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical book</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>.
<h3>Evangeliaria and the text of the New Testament</h3>

<p>Evangeliaria have very little importance for the critic of the Gospel text. At the time when the various Gospel passages began to be collected in book-form for use in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reunions, the various <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the Gospel text and its translations were already in existence; and those Evangeliaria simply reproduce the particular text favoured by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which compiled it. They have even exercised an unfortunate influence on the more recent <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Gospels; certain additions of a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> nature (e.g., <em>in illo tempore; dixit Dominus</em>) which were set at the beginning or end of a reading, have found their way into the text itself. But in the official text of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and in editions of the Greek text of today, owing to the labours of Tischendorf and of Westcott and Hort, these <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> glossaries are very rare. We notice one example in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text: <a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7:31</a> (<em>ait autem Dominus</em>).
<h3>The Evangeliaria and liturgy</h3>

<p>It is especially from a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> point of view that the study of Evangeliaria is interesting. The general method of Greek Evangeliaria in uniform. The first part contains the Gospels of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> beginning with <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; the second part gives the Gospels for the festivals of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> beginning with 1 September. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Churches of the West</a> the distribution of the Gospel pericopes was more divergent because of the various rites. And the ceremonial followed in the reading of the Gospel presents many differences of usage between one church and another, which it would be too long to treat of here.
<h2>Ornamentation of <em>evangeliaria</em></h2>

<p>From the beginning the books used in the liturgy, and more particularly the Gospel <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, were highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, and therefore text and cover were often richly ornamented. From an artistic point of view the distinction between Evangeliaria strictly so called and Gospel <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> is of little importance and is generally disregarded. It consists merely in the fact that the illuminations of the Evangeliaria occur as a rule at those passages set apart for the greater festivals of the year. The <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> oath-book of Anglo-Saxon kings, which King Athelstan received, it would appear, from his brother-in-law, <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, and which he in turn presented to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, is ornamented with figures of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> freely copied from those that adorn the Evangeliarium of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> preserved at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. We are acquainted with Gospels in rolls only from seeing them in miniatures, especially as emblems of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, until well into the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>The roll of the <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Book of Joshua</a> (ninth-tenth century: Vatican Library) is a specimen of what Evangeliaria in this form with miniatures were like. The roll-form remained long in use for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>Costly Evangeliaria are noted above all for their clear ad careful writing. They have helped to perpetuate and propagate certain styles of caligraphy.

<p>The Greek uncial is used in many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the ninth and tenth centuries; and the Latin uncial is also employed, especially in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, far into the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> for Gospel and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works. The copying of the Gospels influenced largely the writings of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Anglo-Saxon scribes, and effected the spread of these characters over the Continent and the development of the Caroline minuscule and the semi-uncial of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. The copyists of the Gospels made great use of other helps to beautify their penmanship, such as the use of purple parchment, of liquid gold and silver, and various coloured inks. The part played by Evangeliaria in the history of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is very great. Especially noteworthy are the miniature insets to the Canons of Eusebius, or tables of Gospel concordance. Illuminated initial letter differed according to the various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of writing; the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scribes used artistic knots and loops, the Merovingian and Lombard writers preferred animal forms, especially fish.

<p>Illuminated scenes, of interest to the iconographist, are often to be met in these copies of the Gospel text. Frequently it is the figure of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> that stands at the head of his Gospel; the donor, or rather a sketch showing the donation of the book, is often found in miniatures from the days of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> to the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The prince is shown receiving from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> the Evangeliarium he will use whenever he assists at the holy offices in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church (cf. the picture of Charles the Bald in the Vivien Bible, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>). But in the tenth and eleventh centuries the prince is shown offering the precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to Christ or to the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the church or <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (cf. the Evangeliarium at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> showing the Emperor Henry II offering the book to Christ).

<p>Among the more famous Evangeliaria may be mentioned the following: the portion of an Evangeliarium from <a href="../cathen/14014b.htm">Sinope</a> (sixth century: in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>); the Evangeliarium of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a> (about 600) in Greek uncials; the Syrian <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of Rabula (586, at Florence) and Etschmiadzin (miniatures of the sixth century); the Evangeliarium of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>) in Lain uncials; the Book of Kells (seventh to ninth century, at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>); the Book of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> (eighth century, in the British Museum, London) of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> workmanship; the Irish-Continental Evangeliaria of St. Gall (about 800); the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Evangeliarium of Godescalc (about 782, in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>); the Ada Codex (ninth century, at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>); the Evangeliaria of Echternach (tenth century, at Gotha), and of the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Uta (about 1002, at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>). Valuable Evangeliaria were carefully treasured, and when used in the offices were placed on a strip of cloth or on a cushion. The back leaf of the binding was usually left plain, but the front cover was enriched with all the skill of the goldsmith. One of the most ancient bindings or covers we possess is that offered by Queen Theodelinda (600) to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Monza. At times plaques of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, resembling <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, were set into these bindings. The earliest of them were of Oriental or Italian origin, and bear isolated figures of Christ or the Blessed Virgin, etc. A number of them, to be found in the countries along the Rhine and the Meuse and in Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (tenth and eleventh centuries), have the scene of the Crucifixion.
