<h1>Evariste R&eacute;gis Huc</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missionary and traveller; born at Caylus (Tarn-et-Garonne), 1 June, 1813; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 March, 1860. He entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> (<a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>) 5 Sept., 1836, was sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1839, and landed at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, whence he proceeded to the newly created (1840) Vicariate of Tartary-Mongolia, where he resided until 1844. During this year Bishop Martial Mouly, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, ordered Huc and his brother missionary Joseph Gabet, his senior by five years (born 4 Dec., 1808), to make a journey of exploration through the territory included in the mission in order to study the customs of the nomadic Mongol tribes to be evangelized.

<p>Accordingly, on 3 Aug., 1844, the two missionaries left their home, called by them Vall&eacute;e-des-Eaux-Noires (Valley of the Black Waters), a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> station about three hundred miles north of Peking, a young lama being the only companion of their long and adventurous expedition. They passed through Dolon-nor, Kwei-hwa-ch'eng, the Ordo country, Ning-hia, Ala-shan, crossed the Great Wall, and reached Si-ning, in the Kan-Su Province; they visited the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Kun-Bum, and having joined on 15 October a Tibetan embassy on its return journey from Peking, they finally arrived by the way of Ku-ku-nor, Tsaidam, and the mountains Bayan-Kara, at Lhasa, the capital of <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, 29 Jan., 1846, the journey having taken eighteen months. Huc and Gabet were well treated by the Tibetans, but, unfortunately, the Chinese imperial commissioner, Ki-shan, was hostile to them. Ki-shan had been governor-general of the Chi-li province and had entered into negotiations with Captain Charles Elliot. during the Opium War, first at Ta-ku, then at Canton; his action being disapproved, he was degraded, sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, reprieved, as is often the case in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and sent to Tibet as imperial commissioner. Through his influence Huc and Gabet were expelled. from Lhasa, 26 February, 1846, under the charge of a Chinese escort, and were conducted to Ta-Tsien-lu; well received by the Viceroy of Ch'eng-tu, they had to endure severe treatment through the Hu-Pe and Kiang-si provinces. The end of September, 1846, they arrived at Canton, where they were received by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> consul, who advised the French consul at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> of the return of his countrymen. Since the travels of the Englishman, Thomas Manning, in Tibet (1811-1812), no foreigner had visited Lhasa. The authenticity of Huc's journey was disputed with some appearance of jealousy by the Russian traveller, Prjevalsky, but the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> has been fully vindicated by Col. Henry Yule (in translation of Prjevalsky, "Mongolia", London, 1876), and especially by Prince Henri d'Orl&eacute;ans, who travelled over part of the same ground.

<p>It must be borne in mind that both Huc and Gabet had written relations printed in the "Annales de la Propagation de la Foi" and the "Annales de la Congr&eacute;gation de la Mission" before the now-famous "Souvenirs d'un voyage dans la Tartarie et le Tibet" was published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1850. The writer of this article collected a number of official papers from the Macao consulate which leave no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of the travellers. The success of the "Souvenirs" was great, and the work was translated into English, German, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, Spanish, Italian, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a>, and Russian. Huc was induced to publish a sequel under the title of "L'Empire Chinois" (Paris, 1854), of no value whatever; a later and more useful book is his "Le Christianisme en Chine, en Tartarie et au Tibet" (Paris, 1857-8). Huc left his congregation 26 Dec., 1853. He took an active part in the negotiations that led to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Cochin-China in 1858.
