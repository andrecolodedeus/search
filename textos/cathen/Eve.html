<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Eve</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>hawwah</em>).

<p>The name of the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the wife of Adam, the mother of Cain, Abel, and Seth. The name occurs only five times in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. In <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs20">Genesis 3:20</a>, it is connected etymologically with the verb meaning "to live": "And Adam called the name of his wife Eve [<em>hawwah</em>]: because she was the mother of all the living". The <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> rendering in this passage is <em>Zoe</em> (=life, or life-giver), which is a translation; in two other passages (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs1">Genesis 4:1</a> and <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs25">25</a>) the name is transliterated <em>Eua</em>. The Biblical data concerning Eve are confined almost exclusively to the <a href="../bible/gen002.htm">second</a>, <a href="../bible/gen003.htm">third</a>, and <a href="../bible/gen004.htm">fourth chapters of Genesis</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">ADAM</a>).

<p>The first account of the creation (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm">Genesis 1</a>, "P") sets forth the creation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in general, and states simply that they were created male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>. The second narrative (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm">Genesis 2</a>: "J") is more explicit and detailed. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is represented as forming an individual man from the slime of the earth, and breathing into his nostrils the breath of life. In like manner the creation of the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her relation to man is described with picturesque and significant imagery. In this account, in which the plants and animals appear on the scene only after the creation of man, the loneliness of the latter (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs18">Genesis 2:18</a>), and his failure to find a suitable companion among the animals (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs20">Genesis 2:20</a>), are set forth as the reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> determines to create for man a companion like unto himself. He causes a deep sleep to fall upon him, and taking out one of the ribs, forms it into a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who, when she is brought to him, is recognized at once as bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. A discussion of the arguments in favor of the historical, or the more or less allegorical character of this narrative would be beyond the scope of the present notice. Suffice it to say that the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">biblical</a> account has always been looked upon by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> commentators as embodying, besides the fact of man's origin, a deep, practical and many-sided significance, bearing on the mutual relationship established between the sexes by the Creator.

<p>Thus, the primitive institution of monogamy is implied in the fact that one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is created for one man. Eve, as well as Adam, is made the object of a special creative act, a circumstance which indicates her natural equality with him, while on the other hand her being taken from his side implies not only her secondary r&ocirc;le in the conjugal state (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 11:9</a>), but also emphasizes the intimate union between husband and wife, and the dependence of the latter on the former "Wherefore a man shall leave <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh." The innocence of the newly created couple is clearly indicated in the following verse, but the narrator immediately proceeds to relate how they soon acquired, through actual transgression, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and with the sense of shame which had been previously unknown to them. In the story of the Fall, the original cause of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the serpent, which in later Jewish tradition is identified with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm#vrs24">Wisdom 2:24</a>). He tempts Eve presumably as the weaker of the two, and she in turn tempts Adam, who yields to her seduction. Immediately their eyes are opened, but in an unexpected manner. Shame and remorse take possession of them, and they seek to hide from the face of the Lord.

<p>For her share in the transgression, Eve (and womankind after her) is sentenced to a life of sorrow and travail, and to be under the power of her husband. Doubtless this last did not imply that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> essential condition of equality with man was altered, but the sentence expresses what, in the nature of things, was bound to follow in a world dominated by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its consequences. The natural dependence and subjection of the weaker party was destined inevitably to become something little short of slavery. But if <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was the occasion of man's transgression and fall, it was also decreed in the Divine counsels, that she was to be instrumental in the scheme of restoration which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> already promises while in the act of pronouncing sentence upon the serpent. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has suffered defeat, and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> painful are its consequences, but henceforth there will be enmity between her and the serpent, between his seed and her seed, until through the latter in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the future Redeemer, who will crush the serpent's head, she will again be victorious.

<p>Of the subsequent history of Eve the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> gives little information. In <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs1">Genesis 4:1</a>, we read that she bore a son whom she named Cain, because she got him (literally, "acquired" or "possessed") through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--this at least is the most plausible interpretation of this obscure passage. Later she gave birth to Abel, and the narrative does not record the birth of another child until after the slaying of Abel by his older brother, when she bore a son and called his name Seth; saying: "God hath given me [literally, "put" or "appointed"] another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew".

<p>Eve is mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Book of Tobias</a> (<a href="../bible/gen008.htm#vrs8">8:8</a>; Septuagint, <a href="../bible/gen008.htm#vrs6">8:6</a>) where it is simply affirmed that she was given to Adam for a helper; in <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs3">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where reference is made to her seduction by the serpent, and in <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs13">1 Timothy 2:13</a>, where the Apostle enjoins submission and silence upon <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, arguing that "Adam was first formed; then Eve. And Adam was not seduced, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being seduced, was in the transgression".

<p>As in the case of the other <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> personages, many rabbinical legends have been connected with the name of Eve. They may be found in the "Jewish Encyclopedia", s.v. (see also, ADAM), and in Vigouroux, "Dictionnaire de la Bible", I, art. "Adam". They are, for the most part, puerile and fantastic, and devoid of historical value, unless in so far as they serve to illustrate the mentality of the later Jewish writers, and the unreliability of the "traditions" derived from such sources, though they are sometimes appealed to in critical discussions.
