<h1>Evesham Abbey</h1>  

<p>Founded by <a href="../cathen/05329a.htm">St. Egwin</a>, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, about 701, in Worcestershire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The founder's charter of endowment, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 714, records that a herdsman of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, named Eoves, was one day favoured with a vision of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. <a href="../cathen/05329a.htm">St. Egwin</a>, being informed, visited the spot and there the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> appeared to him also, commanding him to erect in that place a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at once set about the task, being liberally assisted in the work by Ethelred and <a href="../cathen/04092d.htm">Kenred</a>, successive kings of Mercia, and others. The derivation of the name Evesham is accounted for by the above legend. It is stated, though contemporary charters make the fact <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05329a.htm">St. Egwin</a> resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in order to become first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the new foundation, which he ruled until his death in 717. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and his shrine, beautified by subsequent <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, became in after years one of the richest and most popular in the West of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are recorded as having taken place there. In 941, after the havoc wrought by the Danes, the few remaining <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had survived were ejected and secular canons installed in their place. Their possession of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, however, did not last long, for in 960 <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> and <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">St. Ethelwold</a>, then engaged upon their great reform of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, restored the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> to their own. A second expulsion occurred in 977 and it was not until 1014 that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> effected their final return. With the Norman conquest and the consolidation of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Evesham grew and prospered, and enjoying royal favour became one of the most important <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Black Monks in the country, so much so, indeed, that the jealousy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> was aroused.

<p>As in the case of many other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> they claimed <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of visitation and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authority over the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The dispute continued for a long time, but eventually the exemption from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, originally obtained by <a href="../cathen/05329a.htm">St. Egwin</a>, was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1206. In this as in other matters, the internal history of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, as recorded in the "Evesham Chronicle", differs only in detail from that of any other great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house of the same period. A succession of worthy <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, seldom broken, guided its fortunes wisely and religiously through the eight centuries of its existence. The use of abbatial <em>pontificalia</em> was obtained in 1160 by Abbot Adam from the reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the height of its prosperity the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was one of the largest and most stately in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It had two dependent "cells" &mdash; Penwortham, in Lancashire, and Alcester, in Warwickshire &mdash; besides another in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were also the patrons of seventeen neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; they had a seat in the House of Lords; and they exercised <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> within the bounds of the monastic territory. The great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, which, besides the magnificent shrine of <a href="../cathen/05329a.htm">St. Egwin</a>, contained fifteen altars, was commenced in the eleventh century by Abbot Walter and gradually completed by several subsequent <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. It was cruciform, with a central tower, and was nearly 300 feet in length. The previous campanile having fallen, after being struck by lightning, a magnificent bell tower, still standing, was built by Abbot Clement Lichfield about 1533.

<p>Within the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> precincts and under the very shadow of its minster, were two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, erected by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> for the use of the people of the town which had grown up around its walls. That of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> dates from the thirteenth century and that of All Saints is of a century later. The last of the great <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Evesham, Clement Lichfield, who reigned from 1514 to 1539, added chantries to both of these churches. Unwilling to yield to the rapacity of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, when the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was threatening, he resigned his abbacy, acting, it is said, at Cromwell's suggestion. His unworthy successor was Philip Hawford, who surrendered the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> into the king's hands in the same year, 1539. For this service he was rewarded with a pension of &pound;240, and afterwards became first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Dean of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> may still be seen. The revenues of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at the time of its suppression are given by Dugdale as &pound;1183. The demolition of the buildings commenced almost immediately, and the ruins became, as in the case of so many others, a stone quarry for the neighbourhood. Besides the two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and the bell tower, only a gateway, a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> arch, the almonry, and a few other isolated fragments remain intact to show what manner of building the once glorious abbey of Evesham was.
