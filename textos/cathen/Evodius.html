<h1>Evodius</h1>  

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> after St. Peter. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> mentions him thus in his "History": "And Evodius having been established the first [<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>] of the Antiochians, Ignatius flourished at this time" (III, 22). The time referred to is that of <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, of whom <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has just spoken. Harnack has shown (after discarding an earlier theory of his own) <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> possessed a list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Antioch which did not give their dates, and that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to synchronize them roughly with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. It seems certain that he took the three episcopal lists of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and Antioch from the "Chronography" which <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> published in 221. The <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle of Eusebius"</a> is lost; but in Jerome's translation of it we find in three successive years the three entries <ul> <li>that Peter, having founded the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, is sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he perseveres as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for 25 years; <li>that Mark, the interpreter of Peter, preaches <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Alexandria; and <li>that Evodius is <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. </ul> This last year is given as Claudius III by the Codex Freherianus, but by the fifth-century Bodleian Codex (not used in Schoene's edition) and the rest as Claudius IV (A.D. 44). The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> translation has Claudius II. We have no mention of Evodius earlier than that by Africanus; but the latter is confirmed by his contemporary, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who calls Ignatius the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after Peter (Hom. IV, in Luc., III, 938A). It is curious that the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of Evodius should not have been given in the "Chronography" in the same year as the founding of the Antiochian Church by Peter, and Hort supposed that the three entries must have belonged to a single year in <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">Eusebius</a>. But the evidence is not in favour of this simplification. The year of the accession of Ignatius, that is of the death of Evodius, was unknown to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, for he merely places it in the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a> together with the death of Peter and the accession of <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> 14-68), while in the "History" he mentions it at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> reign.

<p>The fame of Ignatius has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> later writers, such as <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, to speak of him as though he were the immediate successor of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Jerome (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 16</a>) and <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (H.E. VI, 8) call him the "third" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after St. Peter, but this is only because they illogically include Peter among his own successors. Theodoret and Pseudo-Ignatius represent Ignatius as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Peter. The difficulty which thus arose about Evodius was solved in the Apostolic Constitutions by stating that Evodius was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Peter and Ignatius by Paul. The Byzantine chronographer, <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">John Malalas</a> (X, 252), relates that as Peter went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and passed through the great city of Antioch, it happened that Evodus (<em>sic</em>), the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and patriarch, died, and Ignatius succeeded him, he attributes to Evodius the invention of the name <em>Christian</em>. Salmon does not seem to be justified in supposing that <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">Malalas</a> ascribes any of this information to Theophilus, the second century <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. We may be sure that Evodius is an historical personage, and really the predecessor of St. Ignatius. But the dates of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and death are quite uncertain. No early witness makes him a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.

<p>The Greeks commemorate together "Evodus" and Onesiphorus (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs16">2 Timothy 1:16</a>) as of the seventy disciples and as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> on 29 April, and also on 7 September. Evodius was unknown to the earlier Western <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> the Hieronymian, and those of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and Florus; but Ado introduced him into the so-called "Martyrologium Romanum parvum" (which he forged not long before 860) and into his own work, on 6 May. His source was Pseudo-Ignatius, whom he quotes in the "Libellus de fest. Apost.", prefixed to the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> proper. From him the notice came to Usuard and the rest, and to the present Roman Martyrology.
