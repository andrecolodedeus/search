<p>DIOCESE OF EVREUX (EBROICENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the Department of Eure, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; suffragan of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. A legend purporting to date from a certain Deodatus, who is said to have been converted and then later <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by St. Taurinus, makes the latter first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Evreux. According to this legend St. Taurinus was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by St. Clement and sent into Gaul as a companion to St. Denis. According to Mgr. Duchesne this legend arose about the ninth century, when Abbot Hilduin of Saint-Denis was intent on proving the identity of Dionysius the Areopagite with Dionysius (Denis), first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in the time of Charles the Bald (ninth century) St. Taurinus was held in high esteem at Evreux; still earlier, Bishop Landulphus, who seems to have occupied the See of Evreux at the beginning of the seventh century, had built the basilica in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.

<p>It is also impossible to fix the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the reign of St. Gaud, who died a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> at St. Pair, in the Cotenin. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Evreux is Maurusio, who was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 511. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Evreux are: St. Landulphus, St. Eternus, and St. Aquilinus (seventh century); Gilbert (1071-1112), sent by William the conqueror to <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, who preached the funeral oration over the Conqueror; Gilles de Perche (1170-79), sent by Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Jean (1181-92), a friend of Henry II, who in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (1190) <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Berengaria Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Guillaume de Contiers (1400-18), an active member of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>; <a href="../cathen/02241b.htm">Jean de la Balue</a> (1465-67), who later became a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of Louis XI; Claude de Saintes, the Apologist (1575-91); Du Perron (1593-1606), a great factor in the <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of Henry IV. Thomas Lindet (1743-1823), a member of the Convention, was appointed constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Evreux from March, 1791, to November, 1792. The following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the diocese: St. Maximus and St. Venerandus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, at Acquigny on the Eure; St. Leufroy (Leufredus), founder of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at La-Croix Saint-Ouen (Audoenus), who died 21 June, 738, and his brother St. Aifroy (Agofredus), who succeeded him.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Evreux is one of the oldest in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; its octagonal <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> was built at <a href="../cathen/02241b.htm">Cardinal Balue's</a> expense; the church of Gisors has fine <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, among them a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> by Jean Goujon. There are <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the shrine of Notre-Dame de la Couture at Bernay (since the tenth century); to that of Notre-Dame des Arcs at Pont de l'Arche; and to a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of <a href="../cathen/04066a.htm">St. Clotilda</a> <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Andelys. Previous to the anti-Congregations law of 1901, there were <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> at Evreux. Communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> devoted to teaching and the relief of the poor were: the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, an institute founded in 1878 at Etr&eacute;pagny, which has three houses in the English West Indies; and especially the Sisters of Providence of Evreux, an order founded in 1700 by Justine Duvivier and her brother Father Duvivier in a small hamlet called Caer. It was organized by Father James, an <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a> missionary, and re-established in 1804 by Charlotte Le Mesle; it had several houses in the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> in charge of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were in 1900: 2 cr&egrave;ches, 10 day-nurseries, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for boys, 12 for girls, 3 workrooms, 19 homes for the aged, 11 dispensaries, 2 houses of retreat, and 1 insane asylum. The Diocese of Evreux comprised in 1905 (close of the Concordat period) 334,781 inhabitants, 37 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 545 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 25 vicariates paid by the State.
