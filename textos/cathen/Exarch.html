<h1>Exarch</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Exarchos</em>).

<p>A title used in various senses both civilly and ecclesiastically.
<p>In the civil administration of the Roman Empire the exarch was the governor or viceroy of any large and important province. The best-known case is that of the Exarch of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, who, after the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, ruled from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (552-751) in the name of the emperor at Constantinople. In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language an exarch was at first, a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended beyond his own (metropolitical) province, over other <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. Thus, as late as the time of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> are still called exarchs (can. ix). When the name "patriarch" became the official one for the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Antioch (and later of Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>), the other title was left as the proper style of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> who ruled over the three remaining (political) <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian's</a> division of the Eastern Prefecture namely the Exarchs of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> (at Ephesus) of Cappadocia and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> (at Caesarea), and of Thrace (at <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>). The advance of Constantinople put an end to these exarchates, which fell back to the state of ordinary <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> (Fortescue, Orth. <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, 21-25). But the title of exarch was still occasionally used for any <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (so at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> in 343, can. vi). Since the use of all these titles became gradually fixed with definite technical meanings, that of exarch has disappeared in the West, being replaced by the names "Apostolic vicar" and then "primate". A few cases, such as that of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I</a> named Exarch of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> in 1157, are rare exceptions.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christendom</a> an exarch is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who holds a place between that of patriarch and that of ordinary <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The principle is that, since no addition may be made to the sacred number of five <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is independent of any one of these five should be called an exarch. Thus, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> was declared autocephalous (at Ephesus in 431), its <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> receives the title of Exarch of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. The short-lived <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Churches of Ipek (for Servia), Achrida (for <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>) Tirnova (for Rumania), were governed by exarchs though these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> occasionally usurped the title of patriarch (Forteseue, Orth. <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, 305 sq. 317 sq., 328 sq.). On the same principle the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> is an exarchy though in this case as in that of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> modern Orthodox usage generally prefers the (to them) unusual title, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">"archbishop"</a> (<em>Archiepiskopos</em>). When the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> constituted their national Church (1870), not quite daring to call its head a patriarch, they made him an exarch. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> exarch, who resides at Constantinople, is the most famous of all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who bear the title now. Because of it his adherents throughout <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> are called exarchists (as opposed to the Greek patriarchists). It was an inaccurate use of this title when Peter the Great, after abolishing the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (1702), for twenty years before he founded the Russian Holy Directing Synod, appointed a vice-gerent with the title of exarch as president of a temporary governing commission. Since <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> destroyed the old independent Georgian Church (1802) the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Georgia (always a Russian) sits in the Holy Synod at St. Petersburg with the title of Exarch of Georgia (Fortescue, Orth. <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, 304-305). Lastly, the third officer of the court of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, who examines marriage cases (our <em>defensor matrimonii</em>), is called the exarch (ibid., 349).
