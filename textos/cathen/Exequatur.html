<h1>Exequatur</h1>  

<p>(Synonymous with REGIUM PLACET)

<p>Exequatur, as the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Van Espen defines it, is a faculty which civil rulers impart to a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, or other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> enactment in order to give it binding force in their respective territories. This faculty is conceded after ecclesiastical laws have been examined and found not derogatory to any right of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> and, therefore, suitable for <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>. Modern statesmen draw a distinction between the Exequatur and the Regium Placet. The latter, according to them, is given to episcopal acts or acts of any other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior belonging to the nation for which they are approved; while the former is conceded to enactments of a foreign power, that is, to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitutions; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as head of the whole Church, being formally considered as an authority not belonging to any particular country. In both cases, however, state authorities have the power of examining church <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and giving permission for their <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, by which permission <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decrees</a> acquire legal value and binding force.

<p>As to the origin of this supposed right of the State over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is now beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, contrary to the assertions of Gallicans and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, that no trace of it can be found in the early centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or even as late as the fourteenth century. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that during all that period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> General Councils, like those of Nic&aelig;a and Ephesus, requisitioned the sanction of State authorities for ecclesiastical laws; it was not, however, juridical, but only physical, force that was then invoked for <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decrees</a>, in order to enforce their execution by the secular arm. Moreover, had such a power in the State been at that time known, rulers of nations who were sometimes anxious to prevent the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> and execution of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitutions in their domains would have readily appealed to it, instead of resorting to more difficult and troublesome means, in order to impede in every possible way <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> from ever being introduced into their dominions, e.g. in the conflicts of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and of Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. The Regium Placet really dates from the great <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, which lasted from the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> and the election of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1378-1417). In order to guard against spurious <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> granted to some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors the faculty of examining <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitutions and ascertaining their authenticity before <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> and execution. Civil authorities felt bound to adopt the same precautionary measure, though they did not attribute such a power to themselves as a right attached to their office; apparently its use was discontinued when, after the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> condemned the Regium Placet in his Constitution "Quod antidota" (1418). In the fifteenth century, however, it was revived in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> by King John II and claimed by him as a right inherent in the crown. In the sixteenth century the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the Duke of Alcal&aacute;, made it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by law, and in the seventeenth century it was introduced into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in order to preserve the so-called Gallican Liberties, and afterwards into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and other countries.

<p>In theory this supposed right of the State was first propounded and defended as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Pasquier Quesnel</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who denied the supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; later on it was advocated by Gallicans and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, e.g. Van Espen, <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>, <a href="../cathen/09637b.htm">De Marca</a>, and Stockmans, who attributed this power to the State as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of self-defence against possible attempts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to injure the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. More recently it has been defended with particular vigour by Italian jurists and statesmen, e.g. Cavallari, Mancini, Piola, apropos particularly of the "Law of Guarantees" passed in 1871 by the Italian Government in favour of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. However, not only is it historically <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, as shown above, that such a right has been exercised from time immemorial, but it is also juridically <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that such power naturally belongs to the State, particularly as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of self-defence. The <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of that claim and the consequent usurpation of authority by the State appear manifest in the light of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If the binding force of church <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> depended on the approval and consent of the State, it would no longer be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> received legislative power directly from her Divine Founder, and that whatever is bound or loosed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on earth, will be bound or loosed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>). Again, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would, in that case, immediately cease to be a supreme, self-sufficient, and perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and would be deprived of her characteristics of unity, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, catholicity, and <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a>. Moreover, the use of the Exequatur to prevent possible usurpation of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> is contrary not only to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> but also to natural social law and is, therefore, an abuse of power, even if exercised by a State not professing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. A possible conflict of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of two <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and the fear of a consequent injury to their respective <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> do not entitle one of them to impede the free exercise of its ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by the other. Differences, if they arise, may be settled by private mutual understanding or arbitration. It is needless to say that the fear of any usurpation or conflict on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is unfounded, as appears from her <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and history.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as a matter of fact, never claimed the power of revising and approving civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> before <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, although, indeed, past experience would justify her in fearing on the part of the State usurpation of her powers. She contents herself with condemning civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> after <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, if they are injurious to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. We need not wonder, then, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always condemned the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and use of the Regium Placet. <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> first condemned it in his Constitution "Intenta Salutis" and after him a great number of pontiffs, down to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in Propositions 28 and 29 of the Syllabus "Quanta Cura" and in the Allocution "Luctuosis Exagitati" (12 March, 1877), also the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in the Constitution "De Ecclesi&acirc; Christi". To avert animosities and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has made minor concessions in favour of the State as to the exercise of the Regium Placet. In some other instances she has tolerated its acknowledgment by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, particularly to enable them to take possession of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and other temporalities. At present the Exequatur, or Regium Placet, is seldom, if ever, used, at least in its fullness, by modern civil rulers. In the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies it was abolished by the Concordat of 1818, and in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by that of 1855. It must likewise be regarded as abolished in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. According to Aichner, it exists still, but in a mitigated form, in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and some parts of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the strict Exequatur, i.e. previous to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitutions, is not in use, but it is retained in a mild form for the possession of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. According to the "Law of Guarantees" (13 July, 1871), <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who have been provided with <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> must present the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of their appointment to the State authorities; after approval the latter concede the Exequatur and put the incumbents of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in possession of the temporalities hitherto controlled by the government. In this form the Exequatur is at present tolerated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, though it is not devoid of inconveniences, as <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> complained in a letter written to his Secretary of State Cardinal Nina (27 August, 1878).
