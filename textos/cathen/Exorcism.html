<h1>Exorcism</h1>  

<p>(<em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/04713a.htm">DEMONOLOGY</a>, <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">DEMONIACS</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">EXORCIST</a>, <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">POSSESSION</a>.)

<p>Exorcism is (1) the act of driving out, or warding off, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or evil <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a>, from persons, places, or things, which are believed to be <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> or infested by them, or are liable to become victims or instruments of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; (2) the means employed for this purpose, especially the solemn and authoritative <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or any of the higher power in which he is subject.

<p>The word, which is not itself <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">biblical</a>, is derived from <em>exorkizo</em>, which is used in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> (Genesis 24:3 = cause to swear; III(I) Kings 22:16 = adjure), and in Matthew 26:63, by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> thee by the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. . ." The non-intensive <em>horkizo</em> and the noun <em>exorkistes</em> (<a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>) occur in Acts 19:13, where the latter (in the plural) is applied to certain strolling <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who professed to be able to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Expulsion by <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> is, therefore, the primary meaning of exorcism, and when, as in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> usage, this <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> is in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, exorcism is a strictly religious act or <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a>. But in ethnic religions, and even among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the time when there is evidence of its being vogue, exorcism as an act of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> is largely replaced by the use of mere <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> means, to which non-Catholic writers at the present day sometimes quite unfairly assimilate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> exorcism. <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">Superstition</a> ought not to be confounded with <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, however much their history may be interwoven, nor <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic</a>, however white it may be, with a legitimate religious rite.
<h2>In ethnic religions</h2>

<p>The use of protective means against the real, or supposed, molestations of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> naturally follows from the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in their existence, and is, and has been always, a feature of ethnic religions, savage and civilized. In this connection only two of the religions of antiquity, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, call for notice; but it is no easy task, even in the case of these two, to isolate what bears strictly on our subject, from the mass of mere <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic</a> in which it is embedded. The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> ascribed certain diseases and various other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and believed in the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magical</a> charms and incantations for banishing or dispelling them. The dead more particularly needed to be well fortified with <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic</a> in order to be able to accomplish in safely their perilous journey to the underworld (<em>see</em> Budge, Egyptian Magic, London, 1899). But of exorcism, in the strict sense, there is hardly any trace in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> records.

<p>In the famous case where a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> was expelled from the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ministry was unavailing, and the god Khonsu himself had to be sent the whole way from <a href="../cathen/14562c.htm">Thebes</a> for the purpose. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> gracefully retired when confronted with the god, and was allowed by the latter to be treated at a grand banquet before departing "to his own place" (op. cit. p. 206 sq.).

<p><a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic</a> was largely bound up with medicine, certain diseases being attributed to some kind of <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">demoniacal possession</a>, and exorcism being considered easiest, if not the only, way of curing them (Sayce, Hibbert Lect. 1887, 310). For this purpose certain formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> were employed, in which some god or goddess, or some group of deities, was invoked to conjure away the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil one</a> and repair the mischief he had caused. The following example (from Sayce, op. cit., 441 seq.) may be quoted: "The (possessing) <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> which seizes a man, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> (ekimmu) which seizes a man; The (seizing) <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> which works mischief, the evil <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, Conjure, O spirit of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; conjure, O spirit of earth." For further examples see King, <em>Babylonian Magic and Sorcery</em> (London, 1896).
<h2>Among the Jews</h2>

<p>There is no instance in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> being expelled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. In Tobias 8:3, is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who "took the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and bound him in the desert of upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>"; and the instruction previously given to young <a href="../cathen/14749c.htm">Tobias</a> (<a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs18">6:18-19</a>), to roast the fish's heart in the bridal chamber, would seem to have been merely part of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> plan for concealing his own identity. But in <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">extra-canonical</a> <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Jewish literature</a> there are incantations for exorcising <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, examples of which may be seen in <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">Talmud</a> (Schabbath, xiv, 3; Aboda <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a>, xii, 2; Sanhedrin, x, 1). These were sometimes inscribed on the interior surface of earthen bowls, a collection of which (estimated to be from the seventh century A.D) is preserved in the Royal Museum in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>; and inscriptions from the collection have been published, translated by Wohlstein in the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie" (December, 1893; April, 1894).

<p>The chief characteristics of these <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> exorcisms is their naming of names believed to be efficacious, i.e., names of good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which are used either alone or in combination with El (=<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>); indeed reliance on mere names had long before become a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and it was considered most important that the appropriate names, which varied for different times and occasions, should be used. It was this <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, no doubt, that prompted the sons of Sceva, who had witnessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> successful exorcisms in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, to try on their own account the formula, "I conjure you by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preacheth", with results disastrous to their credit (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs13">Acts 19:13</a>). It was a popular Jewish <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, accepted even by a learned cosmopolitan like <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a> had received the power of expelling <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and that he had composed and transmitted certain formul&aelig; that were efficacious for that purpose. The <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Jewish historian</a> records how a certain Eleazar, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Emperor Vespasian</a> and his officers, succeeded, by means of a <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magical</a> ring applied to the nose of a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">possessed person</a>, in drawing out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> through the nostrils &#151; the virtue of the ring being due to the fact that it enclosed a certain rare root indicated in the formula&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, and which it was exceedingly difficult to obtain (Ant. Jud, VIII, ii, 5; cf. Bell. Jud. VII, vi, 3).

<p>But <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic</a> apart, it is implied in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> answers to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who accused Him of casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by the power of <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, that some <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in His time successfully exorcised <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name: "and if I by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, by whom do your children cast them out?" (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs27">Matthew 12:27</a>). It does not seem reasonable to understand this reply as mere irony, or as a mere <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> implying no admission of the fact; all the more so, as elsewhere (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs37">Mark 9:37-38</a>) we have an account of a person who was not a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name, and whose action <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> refused to reprehend or forbid.
<h2>Exorcism in the New Testament</h2>

<p>Assuming the reality of <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">demoniac possession</a>, for which the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is pledged, it is to be observed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appealed to His power over <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> as one of the recognised signs of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiahship</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs23">Matthew 12:23, 28</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs20">Luke 11:20</a>). He cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, He declared, by the finger or spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not, as His adversaries alleged, by collusion with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of demons</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs24">Matthew 12:24, 27</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs22">Mark 3:22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs15">Luke 11:15, 19</a>); and that He exercised no mere <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> power, but a personal authority that was properly His own, is clear from the direct and imperative way in which He commands the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> to depart (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs24">Mark 9:24</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs25">1:25</a> etc.): "He cast out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a> with his word, and he healed all that were sick" (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs16">Matthew 8:16</a>). Sometimes, as with the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanean</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the exorcism took place from a distance (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs22">Matthew 15:22 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/mar007.htm#vrs25">Mark 7:25</a>). Sometimes again the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a> expelled were allowed to express their recognition of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as "the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs24">Mark 1:24</a>) and to complain that He had come to torment them "before the time", i.e the time of their punishment (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs29">Matthew 8:29 sqq</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs28">Luke 8:28 sqq.</a>). If <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">demoniac possession</a> was generally accompanied by some disease, yet the two were not confounded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. In Luke 13:32, for example, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master Himself</a> expressly distinguishes between the expulsion of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> and the curing of disease.


<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also empowered the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">Disciples</a> to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in His name while He Himself was still on earth (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs1">Matthew 10:1 and 8</a>; <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs7">Mark 6:7</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs1">Luke 9:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs17">10:17</a>), and to believers generally He promised the same power (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17</a>). But the efficacy of this <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> power was conditional, as we see from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> themselves were not always successful in their exorcisms: certain kinds of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">spirits</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> explained, could only be cast out by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs15">Matthew 17:15, 20</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs27">Mark 9:27-28</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs40">Luke 9:40</a>). In other words the success of exorcism by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name, is subject to the same general conditions on which both the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the use of <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismatic power</a> depend. Yet conspicuous success was promised (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs18">Acts 16:18</a>; <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs12">19:12</a>), and, no doubt, the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">Disciples</a>, made use of regularly, as occasion arose, of their exorcising power, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has continued to do so uninterruptedly to the present day.
<h2>Ecclesiastical exorcisms</h2>

<p>Besides exorcism in the strictest sense &#151; i.e. for driving out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ritual, following early traditions, has retained various other exorcisms, and these also call for notice here.
<h3 id="A">Exorcism of the possessed</h3>

<p>We have it on the authority of all <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early writers</a> who refer to the subject at all that in the first centuries not only the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay Christians</a> also were able by the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to deliver <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a> or energumens, and their success was appealed to by the early Apologists as a strong argument for the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a>, <a href="../fathers/0126.htm"><em>First Apology</em> 6</a>; <a href="../fathers/01282.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 30</a> and <a href="../fathers/01286.htm">85</a>; <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minutius Felix</a>, <a href="../fathers/0410.htm"><em>Octavius</em> 27</a>; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04161.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> I.25</a>; <a href="../fathers/04167.htm">VII.4</a>; <a href="../fathers/04167.htm">VII.67</a>; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0301.htm"><em>Apology</em> 22, 23</a>; etc.). As is clear from testimonies referred to, no <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magical</a> or <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> means were employed, but in those early centuries, as in later times, a simple and authoritative <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and more especially in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified, was the usual form of exorcism.

<p>But sometimes in addition to words some symbolic action was employed, such as breathing (<em>insufflatio</em>), or <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying of hands</a> on the subject, or making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of cross</a>. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> flying from "the touch and breathing of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>" (<a href="../fathers/0127.htm"><em>Second Apology</em> 6</a>) as from a flame that burns them, adds <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../fathers/310120.htm"><em>Catechetical Lectures</em> 20.3</a>). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> mentions the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying of hands</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (Paulinus, Vit. Ambr., n. 28, 43, P.L, XIV, 36, 42), <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem Syrus</a> (<a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, De Vit. Ephr., P.G., XLVI, 848) and others used this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in exorcising. The <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, that briefest and simplest way of expressing one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Crucified</a> and invoking His Divine power, is extolled by many <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> for its efficacy against all kinds of demoniac molestation (Lactantius, <a href="../fathers/07014.htm"><em>Divine Institutes</em> IV.27</a>; Athanasius, <a href="../fathers/2802.htm"><em>On the Incarnation of the Word</em> 47</a>; Basil, In Isai., XI, 249, P.G., XXX, 557, <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../fathers/310113.htm"><em>Catechetical Lectures</em> 13.3</a>; <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Carm. Adv. iram, v, 415 sq.; P.G., XXXVII, 842). The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> further recommend that the <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> and accompanying <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should be couched in the words of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Writ</a> (Cyril of Jerusalem, <a href="../fathers/310100.htm"><em>Procatechesis</em> 9</a>; <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Ad Marcell., n. 33, P.G., XXVII, 45). The present <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of exorcism as given in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> fully agrees with <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">patristic</a> teaching and is a proof of the continuity of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> in this matter.
<h3 id="B">Baptismal exorcism</h3>

<p>At an early age the practice was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of exorcising <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> as a preparation for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. This did not imply that they were considered to be obsessed, like <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>, but merely that they were, in consequence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> (and of personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in case of adults), subject more or less to the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whose "works" or "pomps" they were called upon to renounce, and from whose dominion the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was about to deliver them.

<p>Exorcism in this connection is a symbolical anticipation of one of the chief effects of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">sacrament of regeneration</a>; and since it was used in the case of children who had no personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> could appeal to it against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> as implying clearly the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> (Ep. cxciv, n. 46. P.L., XXXIII, 890; C. Jul. III, 8; P.L., XXXIV, 705, and elsewhere). <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../fathers/310100.htm"><em>Procatechesis</em> 14</a>) gives a detailed description of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> exorcism, from which it appears that anointing with exorcised <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">oil</a> formed a part of this exorcism in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">East</a>. The only early <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> witness which treats unction as part of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> exorcism is that of the Arabic Canons of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (n. 19, 29). The <em>Exsufflatio</em>, or out-breathing of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> by the candidate, which was sometimes part of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, symbolized the renunciation of his works and pomps, while the <em>Insufflatio</em>, or in-breathing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by ministers and assistants, symbolised the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Most of these ancient <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> have been retained by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to this day in her <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> for solemn <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.
<h3 id="C">Other exorcisms</h3>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or fallen angels retain their natural power, as intelligent beings, of acting on the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and using material objects and directing material forces for their own wicked ends; and this power, which is in itself limited, and is subject, of course, to the control of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>, is believed to have been allowed a wider scope for its activity in the consequence of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Hence places and things as well as persons are naturally liable to diabolical infestation, within limits permitted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and exorcism in regard to them is nothing more that a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the name of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to restrain this diabolical power <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernaturally</a>, and a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His willingness to do so on behalf of His servants on earth.

<p>The chief things formally exorcised in <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> are <a href="../cathen/15564a.htm">water</a>, <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">oil</a>, and these in turn are used in personal exorcisms, and in <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> places (e.g. churches) and objects (e.g. <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altars</a>, <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, <a href="../cathen/02418b.htm">church bells</a>) connected with <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">public worship</a>, or intended for <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotion</a>. <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">Holy water</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramental</a> with which the ordinary <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are most familiar, is a mixture of exorcised <a href="../cathen/15564a.htm">water</a> and exorcised <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>; and in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is besought to endow these material elements with a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power of protecting those who use them with faith against all the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. This kind of indirect exorcism by means of exorcised objects is an extension of the original <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; but it introduces no new principle, and it has been used in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the earliest ages.
