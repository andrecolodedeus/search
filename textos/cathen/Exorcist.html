<h1>Exorcist</h1>  

<p>(<em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/04713a.htm">DEMONOLOGY</a>, <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">DEMONIACS</a>, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">EXORCISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">POSSESSION</a>.)

<p>(1) In general, any one who <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcises</a> or professes to <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs13">Acts 19:13</a>); (2) in particular, one <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for this office, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to which is the second of the four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>.

<p>The practice of <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> was not confined to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in the early ages, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0301.htm"><em>Apology</em> 23</a>; cf. <a href="../fathers/0302.htm"><em>On Idolatry</em> 11</a>) and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/04167.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VII.4</a>). The latter expressly states that even the simplest and rudest of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> sometimes cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, by a mere <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a> (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs17">Mark 15:17</a>), and urges the fact as a proof of the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the inability of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to resist it. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, a specially <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> order of exorcists (or of <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">door-keepers</a>) has never been established but in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, these three <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> with that of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> as a fourth) were instituted shortly before the middle of the third century. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> (261-252) mentions in his letter to Fabius that there were then in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forty-two <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, and fifty-two exorcists, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">readers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">door-keepers</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>), and the institution of these <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">orders</a>, and the organization of their functions, seems to have been the work of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius's</a> predecessor, <a href="../cathen/05742d.htm">Pope Fabian</a> (236-251).

<p>The fourth <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (398), in its seventh <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canon</a>, prescribes the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> for exorcist; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to give him the book containing the formulae of <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, saying, "Receive, and commit to <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, and possess the power of <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposing hands</a> on <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">energumens</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">baptized</a> or <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>"; and the same <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> has been retained, without change, in the <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">Roman Pontifical</a> down to the present day, except that instead of the ancient Book of Exorcisms, the <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">Pontifical</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, is put into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. From this form it is clear that one of the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of exorcists was to take part in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>. That <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcised</a> every day, for some time before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, may be inferred from <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canon</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">council</a>, which prescribed the daily <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> by the exorcists. A further <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is precribed in canon 92, viz: to supply food to, and in a general way to care for, <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">energumens</a> who habitually frequented the Church. There is no mention of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">energumens</a>, for the obvious reason that the official ministrations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were not intended for them. But even after the institution of this order, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> was not forbidden to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, much less to the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nor did those who <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcised</a> always use the forms contained in the Book of Exorcisms. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitutions</a> (<a href="../fathers/07158.htm">VIII.26</a>) say expressly that "the exorcist is not <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>", i.e. for the special office of exorcist, but that if anyone possess the <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismatic power</a>, he is to be recognized, and if need be, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>. This is the practice which has survived in the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>.

<p>As an example of the discretion allowed in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, in the use of the means of <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcising</a>, we may refer to what <a href="../cathen/14332a.htm">Sulpitius Severus</a> relates of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> (Dial., III (II), 6; P.L., XX, 215), that he was in the habit of <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">casting out demons</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> alone without having recourse to the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> or the formulae usually employed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. After a time, as conditions changed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the office of exorcist, as an independent office, ceased altogether, and was taken over by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in major <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">orders</a>, just as the original functions of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> have with the lapse of time passed to a great extent into the hands of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and according to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are authorized to use the <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcising</a> power conferred by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. The change is due to the facts that the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumenate</a>, with which the office of exorcist was chiefly connected, has ceased, that infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has become the rule, and that with the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the disappearance of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demonic</a> power has been curtailed, and cases of obsession have become much rarer. It is only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries labouring in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> lands, where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is not yet dominant, who are likely to meet with fairly frequent cases of <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possession</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries authentic cases of <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possession</a> sometimes occur and every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, especially if he be a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, is liable to be called upon to perform his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as exorcist. In doing so, he is to be mindful of the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial</a> or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, which for most part require that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be consulted and his authorization obtained before <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> is attempted. The chief points of importance in the instructions of the Roman Ritual, prefixed to the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> itself, are as follows:

<ul> <li>Possession is not lightly to be taken for granted. Each case is to be carefully examined and great caution to be used in distinguishing genuine <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possession</a> from certain forms of disease. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who undertakes the office should be himself a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of a blameless life, intelligent, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and he should prepare for the work by special <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">acts</a> of <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, particularly by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and a <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs20">Matthew 17:20</a>). <li>He should avoid in the a course of the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> everything that savours of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and should leave the medical aspects of the case to qualified physicians. <li>He should admonish the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">possessed</a>, in so far as the latter is capable, to dispose himself for the <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confession</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a>, and while the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> is in progress to excite within himself a lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and a patient resignation to His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> will. <li>The <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> should take place in the Church or some other sacred place, if convenient; but if on account of sickness or for other legitimate reasons, it takes place in a private house, witnesses (preferably members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>) should be present: this is specially enjoined, as a measure of precaution, in case the subject is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <li>All idle and curious questioning of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> should be avoided, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and aspirations should be read with great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">fervour</a>, and with a <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of power and authority. <li>The <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is not to be brought near the body of the obsessed during <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> for fear of possible irreverence; but the <a href="../cathen/04533a.htm">crucifix</a>, <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and, where available, <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are to be employed. <li>If expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> is not obtained at once, the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> should be repeated, if need be, several times. <li>The exorcist should be <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vested</a> in <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, and violet <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>. </ul>
