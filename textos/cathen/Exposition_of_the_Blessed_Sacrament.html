<h1>Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament</h1>  

<p><em>Exposition</em> is a manner of honouring the Holy Eucharist, by exposing It, with proper solemnity, to the view of the faithful in order that they may pay their devotions before It. We will speak later of the conditions which constitute proper solemnity, but something must first be said of the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> of the practice.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>There can be no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the practice of exposition came in the wake of that most epoch-making <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> development, the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation of the Host</a> in the Mass. The <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> itself, of which we first hear in its present sense about the year 1200, was probably adopted as a practical protest against the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11763b.htm">Peter Comestor</a> and Peter the Chanter, who held that the bread was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the Mass until the words of institution had been spoken over both <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>. Those who believed that when the words <em>"Hoc est enim corpus meum"</em> had been pronounced, the bread was at once changed into the flesh of our Lord, supported their opinion by adoring the Sacrament, and holding It up for the adoration of the people, without waiting for the words to be spoken over the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, this elevation became a matter of synodal precept, probably before the year 1200. Before long it came to be regarded as a very meritorious act to look upon and salute the Body of the Lord. In this way, even before the middle of the thirteenth century, all kinds of fanciful promises were in circulation regarding the special privileges enjoyed by him, who, on any day, saw the Body of his Maker. He was believed to be protected from sudden death, or from loss of sight. Further, on that day he would be duly nourished by the food he took, and would grow no older, with many other extravagances. The development of these popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> was also probably much assisted by a legendary element current in the romances of the <a href="../cathen/06719a.htm">Holy Grail</a>, then at the height of their popularity. What is certain is, that among all classes the seeing the Host, at the moment It was lifted on high in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, became a primary object of devotion, and various devices &#151; for example, the hanging of a black curtain at the back of the altar, or the lighting of torches held behind the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or server &#151; were resorted to, to make the looking upon the Body of Christ more easy.

<p>Whether the institution of the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> with its procession, an innovation due to the visions of the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> contemplative, <a href="../cathen/08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a> Cornelion, is to be regarded as the cause, or rather the effect, of this great desire to behold the Body of Christ is somewhat <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. But the evidence points to it as an effect rather than as a cause, for, even before the close of the twelfth century, we find a well-authenticated story of the last moments of <a href="../cathen/14329c.htm">Maurice de Sully</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, according to which, being unable on account of sickness to receive <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Holy Viaticum</a>, he satisfied his devotion by having the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> brought to him to gaze upon. An exactly similar incident is recorded of <a href="../cathen/08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a> herself, when upon her death-bed. This also seems to show that the devout longing of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to gaze upon the Sacred Host was not confined to the time of Mass. Moreover, we find it debated among scholastic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as early as the thirteenth century, whether the looking upon the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host was permissible to those in the state of grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and it was commonly decided that far from being a new offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such an act was praiseworthy, if it were done with a reverent intention, and was likely to obtain for the sinner the grace of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> contrition.

<p>In the fourteenth century, we find the practice of Exposition already established, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The "Septililium" of Blessed Dorothea of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> who died a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>, at an advanced age, in 1394, not only bears witness to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> extraordinary desire to see the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, a desire which was sometimes gratified as often as a hundred times in one day, but also incidentally mentions that in certain churches near Dantzig, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was reserved all day long in a transparent <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> like Dorothea could come to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> before It. The practice undoubtedly spread very widely, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. In the fifteenth century, we find numerous synodal decrees passed, prohibiting this continuous and informal Exposition, as wanting in proper reverence. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> enacted at Cologne in 1452, under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas de Cusa</a>, altogether forbids the reserving, or carrying of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in such <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrances</a>, except during the octave of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. An earlier <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> passed at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, in 1416, speaks of permission having previously been given "for the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Body of Jesus Christ</a>, on some few days of the week, to be visibly exposed and shown to public view". But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> declares that he has perceived, that, "by this frequent exposition, the indevotion of the multitude only becomes greater and reverence is lessened". It is clear that these prohibitions did not eradicate the custom, but they seem to have led to a curious compromise, by which the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, throughout a great part of central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, was reserved in "Sakramentshauschen" (Sacrament houses), often beautifully carved of stone, and erected in the most conspicuous part of the church, near the sanctuary. There the Sacred Host was kept in a transparent vessel, or <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a>, behind a locked metal door of lattice work, in such a way that the Host could still be dimly seen by those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> outside. In the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Vadstena in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, the motherhouse of the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a>, we have record of the erection of such a Sacrament House in 1454, in the following terms: "Circa festum Epiphaniae erectum est ciborium, sive columna, pro Corpore Christi, et monstrancia ibi posita cum lampade".

<p>Another custom which seems to have been very prevalent in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, before the close of the fifteenth century, was the practice of exposing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> during the time of Mass, apparently to add solemnity to the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> thus offered. Numerous <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permissions for such Exposition will be found in the "Regest" of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>. (See e.g. 3 Nov., 1514; 20 Nov., 1514, etc.) This practice is still a very favourite one in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, though it seems directly to contravene the spirit of many directions in the official <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"Caeremoniale Episcoporum"</a> prescribing that the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> should, when possible, be removed from the altar at which High Mass is to be celebrated (<a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">Caer. Episc.</a> I, XII, 8-9). Before the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the abuse of such frequent expositions, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and elsewhere, seems to have been very much checked, if not entirely eliminated. In the sixteenth century and subsequently, the development of popular devotion in this matter have been much more restrained, and they have always been subject to strict episcopal supervision. The practice of the <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours' Devotion</a>, and the service now known as Benediction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, are treated separately, and the reader may be referred to the articles in question. But a good many other varieties of services, involving Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> for a longer or shorter period, began to prevail in the time of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> and <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. Of one such variety known as the <em>Oratio sine intermissione</em>, and dating at least from 1574, a full account will be found in the "Acta Mediolanesis Ecclesiae". Not very long after this, we begin to come across various religious institutes founded, with the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, for the express purpose of maintaining the perpetual adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. See the article <a href="../cathen/01152a.htm">PERPETUAL ADORATION</a>, where details are given. In most of these cases we may assume that the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed upon the altar, though in some religious institutes of this kind the exposition is only continued by day.
<h2>Conditions regulating exposition</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> distinguishes between private and public Expositions of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; and though the former practice is hardly known in northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, or in America, it is clearly within the competence of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to permit such private exposition for any good reason of devotion, by opening the tabernacle door and allowing the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> containing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> to be seen by the worshipers. There is, however, in this case no <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroning</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> or use of a <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a>. Public Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> may not take place without the permission, express or implied, or the ordinary. In English-speaking countries, a <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a> is almost always used when the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is set upon Its throne, but in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, one frequently sees simply the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, covered of course with its veil. A certain solemnity and decorum in the matter of lights upon the altar, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, music, and attendance of worshipers is also required, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are directed to refuse permission for public Exposition where these cannot be provided for.

<p>When Mass is celebrated, or the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> recited, at the altar upon which the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed, a new set of <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> comes into force, <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">birettas</a> are not worn, genuflexions on both knees are made before the altar, the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and water are not blessed, the celebrant's hand is not <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a>, etc. The <em>Caeremoniale</em> seems only to contemplate the case of Mass before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> exposed during the octave of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, and at the Mass of Deposition of the <em>Quarant' Ore</em>, but, as already noticed, in many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, local custom has made these Masses before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> of very common occurrence. For the candles that ought to burn upon the altar, and for the ritual to be followed the reader may be referred to the articles BENEDICTION, and <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">FORTY HOURS' DEVOTION</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> directions dealing with such matters as the use of electric light, the arrangement of the throne, etc., are given in detail in manuals like that of Hartmann, or works upon Pastoral Theology such as that of Schulze.
