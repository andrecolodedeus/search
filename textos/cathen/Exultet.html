<h1>Exultet</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in praise of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> sung by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in the liturgy of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> the title of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is "Praeconium", as appears from the formula used at the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>: "ut digne et competenter annunties suum Paschale praeconium . Outside <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the use of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> appears to have been very ancient in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and perhaps, from the reference by St. Augustine (<a href="../fathers/120115.htm"><em>City of God</em> XV.22</a>), in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> attributes its introduction in the local <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>. The formula used for the "Praeconium" was not always the "Exultet", though it is perhaps <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to say that this formula has survived, where other contemporary formulae have disappeared. In the "Liber Ordinum", for instance, the formula is of the nature of a benediction, and the Gelasian Sacramentary has the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Deus mundi conditor", not found elsewhere, but containing the remarkable "praise of the bee &#151; possibly a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Vergilian reminiscence &#151; which is found with more or less modification in all the texts of the "Praeconium" down to the present day. The regularity of the metrical <em>cursus</em> of the "Exultet" would lead us to place the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its composition perhaps as early as the fifth century, and not later than the seventh. The earliest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in which it appears are those of the three Gallican Sacramentaries: &#151; the Bobbio <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (seventh century), the Missale Gothicum and the Missale Gallicanum Vetus (both of the eighth century). The earliest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Gregorian Sacramentary (Vat. Reg. 337) does not contain the "Exultet", but it was added in the supplement to what has been loosely called the Sacramentary of Adrian, and probably drawn up under the direction of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>.

<p>As it stands in the liturgy, it may be compared with two other forms, the Blessing of Palms, and the Blessing of the Baptismal Font. The order is, briefly: <ul><li>An invitation to those present to join with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in the invocation of the blessing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the praises of the candle may be worthily celebrated. This invitation, wanting in the two <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> just mentioned, may be likened to an amplified "Orate fratres", and its antiquity is attested by its presence in the Ambrosian form, which otherwise differs from the Roman. This section closes with the "Per omnia saecula saeculorum", leading into . . . <li><a href="../cathen/05114a.htm">"Dominus vobiscum</a> etc., "Sursum corda etc., "Gratias agamus" etc. This section serves as the introduction to the body of the "Praeconium", cast in the Eucharistic form to emphasize its solemnity. <li>The "Praeconium, proper, which is of the nature of a Preface, or, as it is called in the Missale Gallicanum Vetus, a <em>contestatio</em>. First, a parallel is drawn between the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> of the Old and the New Covenants, the candle being here a type of the <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">Pillar of Fire</a>. And here the language of the liturgy rises into heights to which it is hard to find a parallel in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature. We are drawn out of cold dogmatic statement into the warmth of the deepest <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, to the region where, in the light of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam may be regarded as truly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> fault". Secondly, the candle itself is offered as a burnt-sacrifice, a type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, marked by grains of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> as with the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">five glorious wounds</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. And, lastly, the Praeconium ends with a general intercession for those present, for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rulers. For these last the text as it stands cannot now be used. The head of the Holy Roman Empire alone could be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for in this formula, and the resignation (1804) of the prerogatives of that august position, by the Emperor Francis II of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, has left that position unfilled to the present day.</ul>

<p>It remains to notice three accessories of the "Exultet": the ceremonial carried on during its performance; the music to which it has been sung; and the so called "Exultet-rolls" on which it was sometimes written. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is vested in a white <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, the rest of the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are vested in purple. The affixing of five grains of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at the words <em>incensi hujus sacrificium</em> has probably arisen from a misconception of the meaning of the text. The lighting of the candle is followed by the lighting of all the lamps and candles of the church, extinguished since the close of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>. The chant is usually an elaborate form of the well-known recitative of the Preface. In some uses a long bravura was introduced upon the word <em>accendit,</em> to fill in the pause, which must otherwise occur during the lighting of the candle. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the Praeconium was sung from long strips of parchment, gradually unrolled as the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> proceeded. These "Exultet Rolls" were decorated with illuminations and with the portraits of contemporary reigning sovereigns, whose names were mentioned in the course of the "Praeconium". The use of these rolls, as far as is known at present, was confined to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The best examples date from the tenth and eleventh centuries.
