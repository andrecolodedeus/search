<h1>Ezekiel</h1>  

<p>Ezekiel, whose name, Yeh&eacute;zq'el signifies "strong is God", or "whom <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">God</a> makes strong" (Ezek. i, 3; iii, 8), was the son of Buzi, and was one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who, in the year 598 B.C., had been deported together with Joachim as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki024.htm#vrs12">2 Kings 24:12-16</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/eze033.htm#vrs21">Ezekiel 33:21</a>, <a href="../bible/eze040.htm#vrs1">40:1</a>). With the other exiles he settled in Tell-Abib near the Chobar (Ezek. i,1; iii, 15) in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, and seems to have spent the rest of his life there.In the fifth year after the captivity of Joachim, and according to some, the thirtieth year of his life, Ezekiel received his call as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (Ezek. i, 2, 4 etc) in the vision which he describes in the beginning of his prophecy (Ezek. i,4; iii, 15). From Ezek. xxix, 17 it appears that he prophesied during at least twenty-two years.

<p>Ezekiel was called to foretell <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> faithfulness in the midst of trials, as well as in the fulfilment of His promises. During the first period of his career, he foretold the complete destruction of the kingdom of Juda, and the annihilation of the city and temple. After the fulfilment of these predictions, he was commanded to announce the future return from exile, the re-establishment of the people in their own country and, especially, the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>, the second <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, so that the people would not abandon themselves to despair and perish as a nation, through contact with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whose gods had apparently triumphed over the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. This is the principal burden of Ezekiel's prophecy, which is divided into three parts. After the introduction, the vision of the calling of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (Ezek. i-iii, 21), the first part contains the prophecies against Juda before the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Ezek. iii, 22-xxiv). In this part the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declares the hope of saving the city, the kingdom, and the temple to be vain, and announces the approaching judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon Juda. This part may be subdivided into five groups of prophecies. <ul><li>After a second revelation, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> discloses to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> His course of action (iii, 22-27), the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretells by symbolic acts (iv, v) and in words (vi-vii), the siege and capture of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the banishment of Juda. <li>In a prophetic vision, in the presence of the elders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reveals to him the cause of these punishments. In spirit he witnesses the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> practiced in and near the temple (viii); <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> commands that the guilty be punished and the faithful be spared (ix); <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> majesty departs from the temple (x), and also, after the announcement of guilt and punishment, from the city. With this the judgment which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> communicates to the exiles ends (xi). <li>In the third group (xii-xix) many different prophecies are brought together, whose sole connection is the relation they bear to the guilt and punishment of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Juda. Ezekiel prophesies by symbolic actions the exile of the people, the flight of Sedecias, and the devastation of the land (xii, 1-20). Then follow Divine revelations regarding <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophecies, and disbelief in the very presence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> prophecy. This was one of the causes of the horrors (xiii, 21-xiv, 11), to be visited upon the remnant of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (xiv, 12-23). The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> likens <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the dead wood of the vine, which is destined for the fire (xv); in an elaborate denunciation he represents Juda as a shameless harlot, who surpasses Samaria and Sodom in malice (xvi), and in a new simile, he condemns King Sedecias (xvii). After a discourse on the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (xviii), there follows a further lamentation over the princes and the people of Juda (xix). <li>In the presence of the elders the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> denounces the whole people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for the abominations they practiced in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the Wilderness, and in <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a> (xx). For these Juda shall be consumed by fire, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> shall be exterminated by the sword (xxi). Abominable is the immorality of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (xxii), but Juda is more guilty than <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has ever been (xxiii). <li>On the day on which the siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> began, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> represents, under the figure of the rusty pot, what was to befall the inhabitants of the city. On the occasion of the death of his wife, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbids him to mourn openly, in order to teach the exiles that they should be willing to lose that which is dearest to them without grieving over it (xxiv). </ul>

<p>In the second part (xxv-xxxii), are gathered together the prophecies concerning the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He takes, first of all, the neighbouring peoples who had been exalted through the downfall of Juda, and who had humiliated <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The fate of four of these, the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edomites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, is condensed in chapter xxv. He treats more at length of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and its king (xxxvi-xxviii,19), after which he casts a glance at <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> (xxviii, 20-26). Six prophecies against <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> follow, dating from different years (xxix-xxxii. The third part (xxxiii-xlviii), is occupied with the Divine utterances on the subject of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> restoration. As introduction, we have a dissertation from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in his capacity of authorized champion of the mercy and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after which he addresses himself to those remaining in Juda, and to the perverse exiles (xxxiii). The manner in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will restore His people is only indicated in a general way. The Lord will cause the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shepherds to perish; He will gather in, guide, and feed the sheep by means of the second <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> (xxxiv).

<p>Though Mount Seir shall remain a waste, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall return unto its own. There <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will purify His people, animate the nation with a new spirit, and re-establish it in its former splendour for the glory of His name (xxxv-xxxvii). <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, though dead, shall rise again, and the dry bones shall be covered with flesh and endowed with life before the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Ephraim and Juda shall, under the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">second David</a>, be united into one kingdom, and the Lord shall dwell in their midst (xxxvii). The invincibleness and indestructibility of the restored kingdom are then symbolically presented in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon <a href="../cathen/06628a.htm">Gog</a>, his inglorious defeat, and the annihilation of his armies (xxxviii-xxxix). In the last prophetic vision, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shows the new temple (xl-xliii), the new worship (xliii-xlvi), the return to their own land, and the new division thereof among the twelve tribes (xlvii-xlviii), as a figure of His foundation of a kingdom where He shall dwell among His people, and where He shall be served in His tabernacle according to strict rules, by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of His choice, and by the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">prince of the house of David</a>.

<p>From this review of the contents of the prophecy, it is evident that the prophetic vision, the symbolic actions and examples, comprise a considerable portion of the book. The completeness of the description of the vision, action and similes, is one of the many causes of the obscurity of the book of Ezekiel. It is often difficult to distinguish between what is essential to the matter represented, and what serves merely to make the image more vivid. On this account it happens that, in the circumstantial descriptions, words are used, the meaning of which, inasmuch as they occur in Ezekiel only, is not determined. Because of this obscurity, a number of copyist mistakes have crept into the text, and that at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> has some of them in common with the earliest Hebrew text we have. The Greek version, however, includes several readings which help to fix the meaning. The genuineness of the book of Ezekiel is generally conceded. Some few consider chapters xl-xlviii to be <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, because the plan there described in the building of the temple was not followed, but they overlook the fact that Ezekiel here gives a symbolic representation of the temple, that was to find spiritual realization in <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">God's new kingdom</a>. The Divine character of the prophecies was recognized as early as the time of Jesus the son of Sirach (Eccles. xlix, 10, 11). In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, there are no verbatim references, but allusions to the prophecy and figures taken from it are prominent. Compare St. John x etc. with Ezek. xxxiv, 11 etc.; St. Matthew xxii, 32, with Ezek. xvii, 23. In particular St. John, in the Apocalypse, has often followed Ezekiel. Compare Apoc. xviii-xxi with Ezek. xxvii, xxxviii etc., xlvii etc.
