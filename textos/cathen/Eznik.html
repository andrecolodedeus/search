<h1>Eznik</h1>  

<p>A writer of the fifth century, born at Golp, in the province of Taikh, a tributary valley of the Chorokh, in Northern <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. He was a pupil of Isaac, the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, and of Mesrop. At their request he went first to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, then to Constantinople to perfect himself in the various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and to collect or copy Syriac and Greek <a href="../cathen/09627a.htm">manuscripts of the Bible</a>, and the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> after the Council of Ephesus (431), and is probably identical with Eznik, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bagrevand, who took part in the Synod of Artashat in 449. In addition to his labours in connection with the new version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15367a.htm">V<font size=-2>ERSIONS OF THE</font> B<font size=-2>IBLE</font></a>) and various translations, he composed several works, the principal of which is his remarkable treatise "Against the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">Sects</a>". It was written between 441 and 449, and contains four books or chapters. In the first, against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, Eznik combats the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of matter and the substantial existance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In the second he refutes the chief doctrines of Parseeism. The third is directed against the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> (Pythagoreans, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, Peripatetics, <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>), the writer taking his arguments from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> rather than from reason. The fourth book is an exposition and refutation of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionism</a>. In the work Esnik displays much acumen and an extensive erudition. He was evidently as familiar with Persian as with Greek literature. His <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> diction is of the choicest classical type although the nature of his subject matter forced him to use quite a number of Greek words. The work "Against the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">Sects</a>" was first published at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> in 1762; again, much more correctly and from several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1826 and in 1865. An indifferent French translation was made by LeVaillant de Florival, "R&eacute;futation des diff&eacute;rentes sectes", etc. (Paris, 1853). A good German translation is that by J. M. Schmid, "Eznik von Kolb, Wider die Sekten" (Leipzig, 1900). Langlois published a general introduction to the whole treatise and a translation of part of book II (section 5, 1-11, containing Magism) in his "Collection des historiens anciens et modernes de l'Arm&eacute;nie", II, pp. 371 sq. Eznik is also the author of a short collection of moral <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, printed with his more important treatise.
