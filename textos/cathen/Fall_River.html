<p>DIOCESE OF FALL RIVER (RIVERORMENSIS), U.S.A.

<p>A suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Province of Boston</a>; comprises the counties of <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, Barnstable, Dukes, and Nantucket, with the towns of Marion, Mattapoisett and Wareham in Plymouth county, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, an area of 1194 square miles. It was created 12 March, 1904, by a division of the <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Diocese of Providence</a>, which had included the entire <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">State of Rhode Island</a> and a portion of south-eastern <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and has the distinction of being the first diocese erected by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>. The total population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 309,438, of which 151,633 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Among the latter are Americans, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, Poles, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, with some few Greeks and Syrians. The heavy immigration in years past of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a> people has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> them to far outnumber the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of other nationalities; but this immigration is now at a standstill, while that of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> and Poles is steadily on the increase. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, by reason of recent creation, has no history of its own, its records being included in the history of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, and Providence, in each of which its territory has successively been included.

<p>WILLIAM STANG, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born in 1854 in Langenbr&uuml;cken, in the Grand Duchy of Baden, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received in the gymnasia of his native land and the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> at Saint-Nicolas, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. In October, 1875, he began the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the American College, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1878. In September of the same year he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America, to labour in the <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Diocese of Providence</a>, where his first assignment was to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1884 he assumed charge of St. Ann's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Cranston, Rhode Island. Shortly after he was named <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, positions which he ably filled until 1895. In April of that year he went to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> to become vice-rector of the American College. <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown University</a>, in 1887, had conferred upon him the degree of doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; but a greater recognition awaited him. In August, 1898, the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as the governing board of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, to which the American College is affiliated, named him professor of fundamental <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> in the schola minor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In April, 1899, he returned to <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, to become head of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> Apostolate Band. While still head of the latter, in 1901, he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Edward's church, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, and on 12 March, 1904, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the newly erected See of Fall River. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, 1 May, 1904. In the short space of two years and nine months he proved himself to be a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, indefatigable worker, and charitable to an extreme. He died 2 February, 1907, in St. Mary's Hospital, Rochester, Minnesota. Bishop Stang was the author of a number of works, notably: "Pastoral Theology" (1896); "Historiographia Ecclesiastica" (1897); "Business Guide for Priests" (1899); "Pepper and Salt" (1901); "Socialism and Christianity" (1905); "Medulla Fundamentalis Theologiae Moralis" (1906). He also left many pamphlets and essays and contributed frequently to the "American Ecclesiastical Review".

<p>DANIEL FRANCIS FEEHAN, the second incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, was b. in 1855, at Athol, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. His classical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies were pursued in St. Mary's College, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, from which he was graduated in June, 1876. During the three following years he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at St. Joseph's Seminary, Troy, New York, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 20 December, 1879. Parish work in West Brighton and Fitchburg in the <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Diocese of Springfield</a> engaged his energies until 1889, when he was made permanent <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Bernard's, Fitchburg. He was in charge there when, on 2 July, 1907, he was appointed second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fall River, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 19 September following.

<p>The diocese has a well-equipped <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system. There are 28 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with a staff of 191 teachers and an enrolment of 10, 451 pupils, 4464 boys and 5987 girls. There are three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by the Religious of the Holy Union of the Sacred Hearts, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, and the Sisters of Jesus and Mary, respectively. A boarding college for boys and young men pursuing classical and commercial courses is under the guidance of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart. The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have a well-established commercial day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with a register of 363 pupils. An industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionary Sisters of Mary.

<p>Charity is also well organized. A large <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, St. Ann's, at Fall River, is presided over by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters of Charity of the Presentation. Three <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> directed by the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, the Sisters of Charity (Grey Nuns), and the Sisters of St. Francis, respectively, shelter 600 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. In connexion with one of these asylums is maintained a home for the aged. Admirable work has also been done by the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a>.

<p>There are 108 secular and 20 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> labouring in the diocese. Of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> 57 are English-speaking, 30 French-speaking, 15 Portuguese, 5 Poles, and 1 Italian. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers of the Sacred Hearts, and the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have communities, as also have the Sisters of Charity (Grey Nuns), <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters of Charity of the Presentation, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionaries of Mary, Sisters of the Holy Ghost, Sisters of Holy Cross and Seven Dolors, Religious of the Holy Union of the Sacred Hearts, Sisters of Jesus and Mary, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> (Le Puy), and Sisters of St. Francis.
