<h1>Family of Harlay</h1>  

<p>An important <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of parliamentarians and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who deserve a place in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Achille de Harlay</h2>

<p>Born At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 7 March, 1536; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 October, 1619. Councillor of the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1558, president to the Parlement in 1572, "first president" (<em>premier president</em>) in 1582, he was the typical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and Gallican parliamentarian of the old regime. De la Vall&eacute;e, his panegyrist, calls him the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Cato. He opposed the League when its action in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> became revolutionary (see <a href="../cathen/06074a.htm">G<font size=-2>UISE,</font> T<font size=-2>HE</font> H<font size=-2>OUSE OF</font></a>); he incited the protest of the Parlement against the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1585, which declared Henry of Bourbon, the future Henry IV, stripped of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the throne. Throughout the <em>Jour des Barricades,</em> and after the assassination of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> by order of Henry III, Harlay displayed great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> before the excited members of the League; he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by them in the Bastille till after the death of Henry III. Under Henry IV his memories of the League led him to take the initiative in the condemnation of certain <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (e.g. Mariana, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>) whom he considered an obstacle to royal absolutism. These opinions of Harlay explain his attempt after the assassination of Henry IV, to implicate the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> as responsible for that deed.
<h2 id="section2">Achille de Harlay</h2>

<p>Baron de Sancy, b. in 1581; d. 29 November, 1646. He belonged to a younger branch of the house of Harlay. Bishop-elect of Lavaur he gave up the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> in 1601, on the death of his elder brother, to follow a military career. Marie de Medici, the queen regent, sent him in 1611 as ambassador to Constantinople, his mission being to protect the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> establishments from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> fanaticism. His secretary and dragoman, Deays, has left a journal in which de Sancy is represented as prodigal, debauched, and negligent of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, but an attentive study of his embassy gives quite another <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of him. At the end of 1617 he was the victim of a very annoying incident. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, exasperated by the escape of the Polish <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> Koreski, accused Sancy of having been his accomplice, put several of his secretaries to the torture, and held him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for five days. In consequence of these events Sancy was recalled to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government apologized to Louis XIII. At Constantinople, nevertheless, Sancy had been useful to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, whom he defended against the vexatious proceedings of the Porte. He had also been helpful to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Himself a polyglot, he applied himself to the discovery of rare <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and for this purpose sent to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> M. d'Orgeville, a doctor of the Sorbonne. Sancy was thus enabled to bring home, among other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> in four languages&#175;Hebrew, Chaldean, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a>, and Persian&#175;and several works of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>. Having fallen ill in 1619, Sancy, who had known <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a> at Constantinople, resolved to enter the Oratory. He later supported with his own money the houses of the Oratory at Dieppe, <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and figures among the twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Oratory whom Henrietta of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, when she had become Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, brought to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> with her in 1625. It was to him that <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a>, on leaving <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, committed the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the queen. Sancy, who was certainly back in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the end of 1628, seconded the policy of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, and when in 1629 <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> thought of issuing his "M&eacute;moires", he entrusted that charge to Sancy. The Italian historian, Vittorio Siri, quoting in his unedited "M&eacute;moire" passages found in exactly the same form in the "M&eacute;moires" of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, says that he borrowed them from the "Historia manoscritta del vescovo di San Malo" (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> history of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St-Malo). Robert Lavoll&eacute; compared the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the "M&eacute;moires" of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> and the autograph letters of Sancy, and found that the handwriting in both was the same. Sancy, who in fact became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St-Malo in 1631, was therefore the editor of the "M&eacute;moires" of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. This discovery, made in 1904, has greatly increased his renown.
<h2 id="section3">Charlotte Harlay de Sancy</h2>

<p>(1569-1652), sister of the foregoing, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the Marquis de Bl&eacute;aut&eacute;, assisted <a href="../cathen/09667b.htm">Madame Acarie</a> to establish the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and was in 1604, under the name of Marie de J&eacute;sus, one of the first religious of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, of which she became <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Fran&#231;ois de Harlay</h2>

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1585; died 22 March, 1653. He belonged to the branch of the Harlays which, by its union with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Marck-Bouillon, was allied with the princely houses of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Victor, he became in 1616 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and so remained until 1651, when he resigned in favour of his nephew. His episcopate was notable for the establishment in his archdiocese of a large number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, which aided the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and also for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, for which he manifested great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and which he inaugurated in 1617 in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Jumi&#232;ges. The Ch&#226;teau de Gaillon, which Cardinal Georges d'Amboise had bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, became under the episcopate of Harlay a sort of centre for the study of the Scriptures and religious questions. It was the seat of an academy whose members were to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves as apologists of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. It possessed also a printing-press which published some of Harlay's writings. Under Harlay, also, the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the chapter of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> was opened to the public. Harlay took a successful part in certain polemics against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In 1625 he published the "Apologia Evangelii regem", and in 1633 "Le myst&#232;re de l'Eucharistie expliqu&eacute; par Saint Augustin avec un avis aux ministres de ne plus entreprendre d'all&eacute;guer Saint Augustin pour eux". His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> extended beyond his archdiocese. He joined with Pierre de Marca in the re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in B&eacute;arn, where the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> had made great progress. Even his most ill-disposed contemporaries&#175;like Mme des Loges, who said that Harlay's brain was a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> upside-down, and Vigneul Marville, who spoke of his "well of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> so deep that it was impossible to see a drop"&#175;were compelled to recognize at least the prodigious erudition of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Fran&#231;oise de Harlay-Chanvallon</h2>

<p>The nephew of the foregoing; b. 14 August, 1625; d. at Conflans, 6 August, 1695. From <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Jumi&#232;ges, he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> in 1651. <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> was unfavourable to this appointment, concerning which Anne of Austria had consulted him, but one day, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was absent from the council, <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> de P&eacute;r&eacute;fixe, tutor of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, put through the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>. Desiring to play a political r&ocirc;le, Harlay laboured to further the policy of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, and obtained from <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis XIV</a> <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin's</a> recall from exile. In 1671 he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and each week <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> discussed with Harlay and P&#232;re LaChaise the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Harlay the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Archdiocese of Paris</a> was made a ducal peerage for him and his successor. He possessed real talent as an orator, and played an important part in the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01795a.htm">A<font size=-2>SSEMBLIES OF THE</font> F<font size=-2>RENCH</font> C<font size=-2>LERGY </font></a>), notably in the Assembly of 1682, at which his influence was supreme. It was at his instigation that Le Tellier, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, was entrusted with the report on the conflict between the king and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Charonne, and decided that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should have secured information from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It was probably he who, early in 1685, blessed at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> the marriage of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a>. During his episcopate, in 1683, the foundation-stone was laid of the S&eacute;minaire des Missions Etrang&#232;res. Under him appeared the "Synodicon Parisiense", a collection of all the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held by his predecessors, and it was at his command that the oratorian, G&eacute;rard Dubois, undertook to write the "Historia Ecclesi&aelig; Parisiensis". The character of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> gave rise to much discussion, and unpleasant rumours were current concerning his death. "There are but two little trifles", wrote Mme de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, "which render praise of him difficult: his life and his death." Harlay's opposition of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and his active share in the religious policy of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> may have excited the eulogy of the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a>, P&#232;re Armand Jean, S.J., declares that "he administered his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with more show and cleverness than edification, that his attitude in the Assembly of 1682 was reprehensible, and that he was not less blameworthy in his private life".
