<h1>Family of Hurter</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Friedrich Emmanuel von Hurter</h2>

<p>Convert and historian, b. at Schaffhausen, 19 March, 1787; d. at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a>, 27 August, 1865. From 1804 to 1806 he attended the University of Gottingen, and in 1808 was appointed to a country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The appearance in 1834 of the first volume of the life of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, on which he had been working for twenty years, caused a profound sensation in both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> circles, and was soon translated into French, English, Italian, and Spanish. Hurter was chosen in 1835 <em>antistes</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the canton of Schaffhausen, and later president of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> board, in which capacities he laboured with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. During many years his manifest sympathy and intimacy with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and his disinterested efforts to assist <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> roused the antagonism of his colleagues who took the first pretext to let loose a storm of abuse against Hurter. As a result he resigned his dignities in 1841, lived in retirement for three years, and in 1844 went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where on 16 June he made his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> being the signal for renewed attacks. In 1846 he was appointed imperial counsellor and historiographer at the Court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and took up the task assigned him, the life of Emperor Ferdinand II, which, however, was withheld from the press by the court censors, but appeared later at Schaffhausen. The Revolution of 1848 involved the loss of Hurter's position at Court, to which, however, he was restored in 1852. Till his death he laboured for the spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, especially in connexion with the foreign mission field; he was also in close touch with the greatest scholars of the day. He was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a commander of the Order of St. Gregory, and was a member of the academics of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. In addition to his "Leben Innocenz III" (4 vols., Hamburg, 1834-42), Hurter was the author of "Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten aus dem lezen Dezennium des 18 Jahrhunderts" (1840); "Geburt and Widergeburt" (Schaffhausen, 1845-46), an autobiography; "Geschichte Kaiser Ferdinands II. und seiner Eltern" (Schaffhausen, 1850-65); "Philipp Lang, Kammerdiener Kaiser Rudolfs II. (Schaffhausen, 1851); "Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte Wallensteins" (Freiburg im Br., 1855); "Franz&ouml;sische Feindseligkeiten gegen Oesterreich zur Zeit des dreizigj&auml;hrigen Krieges" (Vienna, 1859); "Wallensteins vier letzte Lebensjahre" (1862).
<h2 id="section2">Heinrich von Hurter</h2>

<p>Son of the preceding, b. at Schaffhausen, 8 August 1825; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 30 May 1895. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1851, and later appointed to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Besides volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, his writings include; "Konzil und Unfehlbarkeit" (1870); "Sch&ouml;nheit und Wahrheit der katholischen Kirche" (9 vols., 1871-78); "Friedrich von Hurter und seine Zeit" (2 vol., 1876).
<h2 id="section3">Hugo von Hurter</h2>

<p>Distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; b. at Schaffhausen, 11 January, 1832; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1855. From 1849 to 1856 he studied at the Germanicum in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was made doctor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1857 he entered into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and in 1858 was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a>. His chief works are: "Theologiae dogmaticae compendium" (3 vols., Innsbruck, 1876-78; 11th ed., 1903); "Nomenclator litterarius theolgiae catholicae" (3 vols., Innsbruck, 1871-86; 3rd ed., 5 vols., 1903); "Medulla theologiae dogmaticae" (2 vols., Innsbruck, 1870; 7th ed., 1902). He also edited the collection "Selecta opuscula SS. Patrum" (54 vols., 1868-92).
