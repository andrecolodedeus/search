<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Family of Lamoignon</h1>  

<p>Illustrious in the history of the old magistracy, originally from Nivernais. Owing to the nearness of the University of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, the Lamoignons, in the sixteenth century, had the benefit of the excellent juridical instruction given there.
<h2>Charles de Lamoignon (1514-73)</h2>

<p>The pupil of the renowned jurisconsult Alciat.
<h2>Chr&eacute;tien de Lamoignon (1567-1636)</h2>

<p>Son of the preceding, was a pupil of Cujas. Both this and the foregoing were members of the Parlement of Paris.
<h2>Marie des Landes (1576-1651)</h2>

<p>Wife of Chr&eacute;tien de Lamoignon, was associated in work with St. Vincent de Paul, who called her the mother of the poor; and she founded an association for the deliverance of those <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>.
<h2>Madeleine de Lamoignon (1609-87)</h2>

<p>Daughter of Chr&eacute;tien, whom <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> prepared for her first communion, also assisted St. Vincent de Paul. Owing to her co-operation the saint was able to found the Hotel-Dieu and establish the institution for foundlings. When she died, a contemporary said, "The poor have lost one hundred thousand crowns."
<h2>Guillaume de Lamoignon (1617-77)</h2>

<p>Guillaume de Lamoignon, having become in 1644 master of requests in the Parlement, took an active part in the Fronde of the Parlement against <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>. He became first president of the Parlement in 1658. The great work which he did towards preparing the codification of French <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> has made him famous. A distinguished member of the Society of the Holy Sacrament, he was greatly devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. He induced <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert</a> to give up his cherished <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of putting back to twenty-seven the age for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the years required for <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to twenty for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and twenty-seven for the men. He had certain Gallican tendencies, and in 1663 he spoke before the Parlement in favor of the "liberties of the Gallican church" against a thesis suspected of ultramontanism. A nephew of Bishop Potier of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, a close friend of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Hermant, Lamoignon was supposed to sympathize with Port Royal, but he chose Rapin, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, as tutor for his sons, whom he also brought into close acquaintance with <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>. When in 1664 the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> deferred to the Parlement a confutation of <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal's</a> "Provinciales" written by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which condemned this book nevertheless spared the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On this occasion Lamoignon said to the king that he had been "a witness of the unfair outbursts of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> in all the differences they had with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; and this <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> party, which was being formed in the kingdom on the dissemination of the new teaching, was but a cabal which would become pernicious to the State". It was Lamoignon who, having as first president to settle the dispute that had arisen at the Sainte-Chapelle between the <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> and the treasurer regarding a desk, furnished <a href="../cathen/02623a.htm">Boileau</a> with the account of this incident from which the latter evolved the celebrated poem of the "Lutrin".
<h2>Chr&eacute;tien-Fran&ccedil;ois de Lamoignon (1644-1709)</h2>

<p>Son of the foregoing, was a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>.
<h2>Nicolas Lamoignon-B&acirc;ville (1648-1724)</h2>

<p>Brother of the preceding, intendant of Poitou (1682-85), and of Languedoc (1685-1718), made himself famous by the measures he adopted against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of these provinces, and by the manner in which he associated himself with the religious policy of Louvois, of which the revocation of the Edict of Nantes was the culminating point. But it is without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that Voltaire accused him of having instigated this revocation. "I never counselled the <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revocation</a> of the Edict of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>", he wrote to his brother in 1708. On the contrary he considered that "in religion hearts must be attacked, for it is there that it resides", and immediately after the revocation he sent for <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a> to come and evangelize the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. From 1702 to 1704 he helped in the repression of the uprising of the <a href="../cathen/03218a.htm">Camisards</a>, occasioned in the Cevennes by English and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> influences.
<h2>Malesherbes (1721-94)</h2>

<p>Malesherbes, who defended Louis XVI and died on the scaffold, was the grandson of Chr&eacute;tien-Fran&ccedil;ois de Lamoignon.
