<h1>Family of d'Ailleboust</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Louis d'Ailleboust</h2>

<p>Sieur de Coulanges, third Governor of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> 31 May, 1660. He came to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1643. He was an associate of the <em>Compagnie de Montr&eacute;al</em>, aided <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> in founding <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, building the first fortifications, and was commandant of the city from October, 1646, to May, 1647. Sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he obtained help and important reforms in favor of the colonists. He succeeded <a href="../cathen/10543a.htm">Montmagny</a> as Governor General, arriving at Qu&eacute;bec 20 August, 1648. He formed a flying camp of forty soldiers to guard the communications between the capital and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. During his term of office, the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> missions of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> were destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Br&eacute;beuf, Lalemant, Daniel, <a href="../cathen/06388b.htm">Garnier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03551a.htm">Chabanel</a>, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (1648-49). He settled the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> refugees on the Island of Orl&eacute;ans, and tried to establish an alliance and commercial relations with New England. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Druillettes</a> has left an account of the embassy sent on this occasion. On the 21st of October, 1651, <a href="../cathen/09043a.htm">Jean Lauzon</a> succeeded d Ailleboust as governor, and the latter was not sorry to resign a post in which he had been left without support. In reward of his services, several important seigniories were granted him (Argentenaye, Coulanges, Saint Villemer). He retired to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where he took to farming, and was the first to sow French grain in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In 1665 he accompanied <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he induced the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> to assume possession of the Island of Montreal, and to Send missionaries thither. He also persuaded the Sisters of l'Institut Saint Joseph, of Lafl&egrave;che, to take charge of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu. Returning to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> with four <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, d Ailleboust was entrusted with the interior administration of the colony (18 September, 1657; 4 July, 1658) until the arrival of d Argenson. He laid (23 March, 1658) the first stone of the church of Sainte Anne de Beaupr&eacute;, the place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> which has since become so famous. He died leaving a name as a good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, a man of judicious and impartial mind.
<h2 id="section2">Barbe d'Ailleboust</h2>

<p>(N&eacute;e de Boulogne). Date of birth unknown; died 1685. Wife of the foregoing; followed her husband to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in order to devote her life to the instruction of the Indians. She learned the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> language, which she taught to the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a>, Sister Bourgeois, and Barbe d'Ailleboust, rivals in virtue, have given <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> examples worthy of the great ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the death of her husband, with whom she had lived in continence, in order to fulfill a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made in early life, she withdrew to the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where she divided her time between <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. In 1663, with the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Father Chaumonot</a>, she founded the Confraternity of the Holy Family, a devotion which spread all over <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and did much to preserve good <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. Mgr. de Laval subsequently invited her to Qu&eacute;bec, and gave her the general management of this <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">pious confraternity</a>, which was canonically erected 14 March, 1664; and still exists. In 1675, the Bishop had a little book printed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, instructing the members of the confraternity as to the virtues which they should practice, and the rules they should follow (La solide d&eacute;votion &agrave; la Sainte Famille). He also established the feast of the Holy Family, and caused a mass and office to be drawn up which are proper to the Diocese of Qu&eacute;bec. Madame d'Ailleboust, who was endowed with great talents, with charms of mind and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, was sought in marriage by the Governor, de Courcelles, and by the Intendant, <a href="../cathen/14438a.htm">Talon</a>, but she was faithful to her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. She died at the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, in Qu&eacute;bec, whither she had retired, to which she had given her fortune, and where she is held in veneration.
<h2 id="section3">Charles Joseph d'Ailleboust</h2>

<p>Sieur des Musseaux, nephew of the foregoing; b. 1624; d. 1700; came to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1650, where he commanded the flying column organized to protect the settlements against <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> attacks, and was Commandant of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> from October, 1651, to September, 1653, during the absence of <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a>, whom he accompanied to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1653-56). Argenson, the Governor, who had confidence in d'Ailleboust's worth, suggested him to the King as his lieutenant in 1658. He was made civil and criminal judge of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, a position which he held until 1693. A good soldier, a prudent administrator, an upright judge d'Ailleboust at his death left, by his marriage with Catherine le Gardeur de Tilly, several children who took service, and distinguished themselves, in the colonial army. They founded the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of d'Argenteuil, de Cussy, de Perigny, and de Manthet; names borrowed from Champagne, and still, found in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, near Auxerre (Yonne). The d'Ailleboust <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was confirmed in its rank of nobility by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, registered at Qu&eacute;bec in 1720. Some of its descendants still live at the village of <a href="../cathen/03458a.htm">Caughnawaga</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>.
