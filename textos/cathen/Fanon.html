<h1>Fanon</h1>  

<p>A shoulder-cape worn by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone, consisting of two pieces of white silk ornamented with narrow woven stripes of red and gold; the pieces are nearly circular in shape but somewhat unequal in size and the smaller is laid on and fastened to the larger one. To allow the head to pass through there is made in the middle a round opening with a vertical slit running down farther. The front part of the fanon is ornamented with a small cross <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> in gold.

<p>The fanon is like an <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>; it is, however, put on not under but above the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wears it only when celebrating a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>, that is, only when all the pontifical <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> are used. The manner of putting on the fanon recalls the method of assuming the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a> universal in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and still observed by some of the older orders (see <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">AMICE</a>). After the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has vested the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the usual <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, the cingulum and sub-cinctorium, and the <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, he draws on, by means of the opening, the fanon and then turns the half of the upper piece towards the back over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> head. He now vests the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, tunicle, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, then turns down that part of the fanon which had been placed over the head of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, draws the front half of the upper piece above the tunicle, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, and finally arranges the whole upper piece of the fanon so that it covers the shoulders of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> like a collar.

<p>The fanon is mentioned in the oldest known Roman Ordinal, consequently its use in the eighth century can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. It was then called <em>anabolagium</em> (<em>anagolagium</em>), yet it was not at that period a vestment reserved for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This limitation of its use did not appear until the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> began to put the vestment on under the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> instead of over it, that is, when it became customary among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to use the fanon as an ordinary <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>. This happened, apparently in imitation of the usage outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, between the tenth and twelfth centuries; however, the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> cannot be given. But it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that as early as the end of the twelfth century the fanon was worn solely by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as is evident from the express statement of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216). The vestment was then called an <em>orale</em>; the name of fanon, from the late Latin <em>fano</em>, derived from <em>pannus</em>, (<em>penos</em>), cloth, woven fabric, was not used until a subsequent age. Even as early as the eighth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wore the fanon only at solemn high Mass. The present usage, according to which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is vested, in addition to the fanon, with an <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a> under the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, did not appear, at the earliest, until the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>As to the form of the fanon and the material from which it was made in early times no positive information exists. Late in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was made of white silk, as is shown by the <a href="../cathen/08084a.htm">inventory</a> of the year 1295 of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasure, as well as by numerous works of art; the favourite ornamentation was one of narrow stripes of gold and of some colour, especially red, woven into the silk. Up into the fifteenth century the fanon was square in shape; the present collar-like form seems to have appeared about the sixteenth century or even later.
