<h1>Faustus of Riez</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez (<em>Rhegium</em>) in Southern Gaul (Provence), the best known and most distinguished defender of Semipelagianism, b. between 405 and 410, and according to his contemporaries, Avitus of Vienne and Sidonius Apollinaris, in the island of Britain; d. between 490 and 495. Nothing, however, is known about his early life or his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He is thought by some to have been a lawyer but owing to the influence of his mother, famed for her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, he abandoned secular pursuits while still a young man and entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a>. Here he was soon <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and because of his extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was chosen (432) to be head of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in succession to Maximus who had become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez. His career as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> lasted about twenty or twenty-five years during which he attained a high reputation for his wonderful gifts as an extempore preacher and for his stern asceticism. After the death of Maximus he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez. This elevation did not make any change in his manner of life; he continued his ascetic practices, and frequently returned to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a> to renew his fervour. He was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> advocate of monasticism and established many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In spite of his activity in the discharge of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he participated in all the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussions of his time and became known as a stern opponent of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in all its forms. For this, and also, it is said, for his view, stated below, of the corporeity of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he incurred the enmity of Euric, King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, who had gained possession of a large portion of Southern Gaul, and was banished from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His exile lasted eight years, during which time he was aided by loyal friends. On the death of Euric he resumed his labours at the head of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and continued there until his death. Throughout his life Faustus was an uncompromising adversary of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, whom he styled <em>Pestifer</em>, and equally decided in his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestination</a> which he styled "erroneous, blasphemous, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, fatalistic, and conducive to immorality". This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in its most repulsive form had been expounded by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> named Lucidus and was condemned by two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, Arles and Lyons (475). At the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who composed these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and especially Leontius of Arles, Faustus wrote a work, "Libri duo de Grati&acirc; Dei et humanae mentis libero arbitrio", in which he refuted not only the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">Predestinarians</a> but also those of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> (P.L., LVIII, 783). The work was marred, however, by its decided Semipelagianism, for several years was bitterly attacked, and was condemned by the Synod of Orange in 529 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, Freiburg, 1908, no. 174 sqq. - old no. 144; P.L., XLV, 1785; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VIII, 712). Besides this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, Faustus maintained that the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in a certain sense corporeal, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone being a pure spirit. The opposition to Faustus was not fully developed in his lifetime and he died with a well-merited reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. His own flock considered him a saint and erected a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Faustus wrote also: "Libri duo de Spiritu Sancto" (P.L., LXII, 9), wrongly ascribed to the Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paschasius. His "Libellus parvus adversus Arianos et Macedonianos", mentioned by Genadius, seems to have perished. His correspondence (<em>epistulae</em>) and sermons are best found in the new and excellent edition of the works of Faustus by Engelbrecht, "Fausti Reiensis praeter sermones pseudo-Eusebianos opera. Accedunt Ruricii Epistulae" in "Corpus Scrip. eccles. lat.", vol. XXI (Vienna, 1891).
