<h1>Fa&ccedil;ade</h1>  

<p>The face or front of any building. In <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">ecclesiastical architecture</a> the term is generally used to designate the west front; sometimes the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> fronts. For ritualistic reasons, the church architect was everywhere compelled to treat the end wall of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> as the grand fa&ccedil;ade.
<h2>Early Christian period</h2>

<p>The fa&ccedil;ades of the churches of the early period were generally built on the model of the old Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, and were constructed according to Roman methods, and largely formed of columns and other features taken from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a> buildings. Their interest is principally from an arch&aelig;ological point of view. The fa&ccedil;ades of the early Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> were exceedingly simple in their upper surfaces. There were but two types; the central gable, following usually the outline of the structure behind it, and the screen fa&ccedil;ade, usually made to overhang for purposes of protection, and formed by a gradual projection of the courses of brick both forward and sideways. In the more important churches the entire surface was concealed by a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> composition extending from summit to portico. Such were St. John Lateran's, St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's</a>, St. Mary Major's, etc. This converted the fa&ccedil;ade above the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> into a blaze of colour. Toward the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> more windows were sometimes opened in the fa&ccedil;ade. At St. Peter's, in the thirteenth century, beside the wheel window in the gable, there were two rows of three tall mullioned windows, the lower row being flanked by two more. The lower part of the fa&ccedil;ade was always covered by a projecting portico, consisting either of one side of the quadrangular atrium, or of an independent arcade or <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a>. The wall space underneath was usually broken by as many doors as there were <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> to the church, normally three, sometimes five. In the minor <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> there was but a single door, and in exceptional cases, as at St. Peter's, there was a supplementary door for special occasions.

<p><a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> fa&ccedil;ades as a rule were left comparatively plain, partly, no doubt, on account of their location and surroundings. A Byzantine church usually stood apart in a close, and when possible trees were planted about to give shade. In towns, the church, its grounds, etc., were generally surrounded with walls. It was entered through a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> forecourt or atrium, in the centre of which stood the phiale, or fountain, where the required ablutions were made. Across the lower portion of the front of the church stretched the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> or <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a>, which sometimes had a <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> or portico in front of it. Many churches had a double <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a>, the outer one being called the eso-narthex, generally appointed for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> communicated with the church by means of three doors; that in the centre being large and often richly ornamented. The two others, situated one on each side, were small and not remarkable. The central door was called the Beautiful Gate, sometimes the royal or basilican gate.

<p>In the larger churches, above the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> there was often an enclosed upper gallery for the accommodation of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, called the gyn&aelig;conitis. This gallery was enclosed partly by the outside wall or walls and partly by grilles, and was reached by a staircase for the use of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> only. From the outside it was lighted by a series of narrow windows, generally covered by round arches, or one or more double windows were formed by the interposition of a pillar. As a rule the windows are small and grouped together, or else they are of considerable width, and divided into three lights by columns or by thin strips of unmoulded marble. The lower portion of the windows was often filled with thin slabs of translucent marble, sculptured on the outside, which allowed the light to shine through to a certain extent. Especially in the Neo-Byzantine style, there are occasionally <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a>, balconies and machicolations, which give relief to the general flatness. These features are well marked with the grace peculiar to the East. Examples at Constantinople, Sts. Sergius and Bacchus (527-532), and Sancta Sophia (532-537). The church of the Virgin at Misitra and the Catholicon, at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> (both uncertain, 11th to 13th century), and St. Mark's, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1100-1350). Examples of Italian Byzantine are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Palermo and <a href="../cathen/03476a.htm">Cefal&ugrave;</a>. The present fa&ccedil;ade of St. Mark's, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, is a later casing upon the original Byzantine fa&ccedil;ade, and stands alone as regards its style, although generally classed as Byzantine. The first appearance of the Byzantine in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was the church of San Vitale, at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Kiev, and Novgorod, are among the best known examples.

<p>Lombardic (sometimes called Lombard Romanesque) fa&ccedil;ades were the most unfortunate part of Lombard churches. The designing of fa&ccedil;ades to the basilican plan and section gave much trouble to many different <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of architecture, but by none was it treated with such signal failure as by the Lombards. In declining to attach the campaniles to the church, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> rejected what apparently was the only possible solution. The continuous shape of the gable was used by the Pavians, even in churches where the aisle roofs were much lower than those of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. "False" fa&ccedil;ades, like that of San Michele Maggiore, resulted in designs that obviously belied the basilican section. Even before this, it had been the custom, where the three <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> had been expressed, to raise the walls of the fa&ccedil;ade much above the actual roof of the church, perhaps with a view to make the church appear externally larger than it really was. This <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> continued to be practised in the churches of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and indeed throughout all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, so that it finally became characteristic of Italian church architecture. On the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> fa&ccedil;ade thus obtained, ornament, utterly irrelevant for the most part, was spread with a more or less lavish hand. The fa&ccedil;ade of S. Ambrogio, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, with its great open arches is, perhaps, the most successful one the Lombards ever erected.



<p>Romanesque fa&ccedil;ades. Their characteristics, as a whole, may be summed up as follows: <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">Buttresses</a> formed as pilaster strips of slight projection, connected at the top by horizontal mouldings, or by a row of semicircular arches resting on a corbel-table projecting from the wall. Semicircular arches, resting on rudely formed capitals, also occur. Door and window openings are very characteristic. The principal, upon which the jambs were formed, was in receding planes, or rectangular recesses, known as "orders", in which were placed circular columns or shafts. The arches followed the same method, being built in concentric rings. A continuous abacus often occurs over these columns, and the profile of the jamb is carried round the semicircular portion of the arch. The characteristic rose (or wheel) window occurs over the principal doorway of the fa&ccedil;ade. Mouldings were often elaborately carved. The carving and ornaments are derived from many types of the vegetable and animal kingdom, and treated in a conventional way. Local influences were instrumental in producing different local characteristics.

<p>In Central Italian Romanesque, beauty in detail was more sought after than completeness of style. Byzantine influence was strong, especially in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, the latter possessing a distinct style of its own, sometimes called <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a>. San Miniato's, in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, is interesting as marking the period of transition, in the eleventh century, from the Basilican to the Romanesque type. In Northern Italian Romanesque, arcades are restricted to the tops of gables. The general character is less refined, owing to the use of stone and brick instead of marble. Details show a breaking away from Classic precedent. In <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, hunting and other scenes reflecting the life of the northern invaders are frequent, and in these a grotesque element is prevalent. S. Antonio's, in <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, is an example.

<p>Southern Italian Romanesque shows Byzantine and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> influence, as instanced in <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>, and the Martorana Church, in <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>. The detail of these buildings is always refined and graceful, which may be due to some extent to the Greek descent of the inhabitants of this part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Southern French Romanesque is remarkable for its rich decorative fa&ccedil;ades. <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">Buttresses</a> are generally mere strips, of slight projection, and the fa&ccedil;ades were arranged in stories, with window lights in pairs or groups. Imposing western entrances are characteristic of this period. The west fronts of the churches of the Charente District, in Aquitania, were elaborately treated with carved ornament representing foliage or figures of men and animals. On the ground story the capitals so treated were often continued as a rich, broad frieze. German Romanesque bears a strong resemblance to that of North <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the fa&ccedil;ades the most richly ornamented parts are the doorways and capitals; there is also a wealth of circular and octagonal turrets and arcaded galleries. Examples: The church of the Apostles, at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of Worms, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Spires.
<h2>Gothic facades</h2>

<p>The first in point of dignity is undoubtedly that of Notre-Dame de Paris; in richness, those of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The fa&ccedil;ade of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, of which only the three lower stories are of the thirteenth century, would doubtless have been the noblest of all Gothic fa&ccedil;ades, had it been finished according to the original design. The great French Gothic fa&ccedil;ades are often criticized on the ground that they somewhat disguise the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of the edifice which they enclose; and it is, perhaps, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that an entirely satisfactory design for a western fa&ccedil;ade was hardly ever realized in a large <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>. As a rule, the fa&ccedil;ade rarely wholly expresses the form of the building which it encloses, except in buildings of a very simple character. In the fa&ccedil;ades of smaller churches where the towers are omitted, as at Nesle, Auvers, Heronville, and Champagne, the whole structural form of the building is expressed as fully as it can be. The west fronts of Senlis, Paris, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> sufficiently illustrate the development and the characteristics of the French Gothic western fa&ccedil;ade.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the Anglo-Norman western fa&ccedil;ade was, as a rule, both inappropriate as a termination to the building, and ill-composed as an independent <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> design. Very few early fa&ccedil;ades remain. The most important extant fronts of the thirteenth century are those of Lincoln, <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, Wells, and <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>. The fa&ccedil;ade of Lincoln exhibits four different styles of architecture &mdash; the work of as many different periods of construction. The portals of English churches are in general insignificant and diminutive, and those of Wells are especially so. The fa&ccedil;ade of <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> is entirely unrelated to the building which it encloses. As a rule, the west front in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is devoid of Gothic character; but among exceptions is the western fa&ccedil;ade of Ripon <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the early pointed architecture of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, western towers, when they occur, are less imposing than those of the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The western Gothic fa&ccedil;ades in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> call for no extended remarks. The fa&ccedil;ade of the Lorenzkirche of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, dating probably from the second half of the thirteenth century, exhibits a strange combination of Romanesque and Gothic features. Towards the close of the thirteenth century, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the west front began to receive more elaborate and peculiar treatment. Acute open gables over the portals, free-standing mullions and tracery over the face of the wall above, and tall open gallery in front of the openings of the second stories of the towers, are among the new features. Entrances are often north or south, instead of being at the west end. Towers with spires were much used, open-work tracery in the spires is very characteristic. The typical examples of German Gothic are <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> Gothic fa&ccedil;ades show the influence of Roman tradition in their classic forms of construction and decoration, which was so great that the verticality which marks the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> in the north of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> does not pervade the Italian examples, to anything like the same extent. From the absence of vertical features and shadows in the fa&ccedil;ade, flatness is the predominating characteristic. There was a general absence of pinnacles. Stone or marble of different colours, carried in systematic band-courses or patterns throughout the design, gives a special character, as at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, etc. A large central circular window was a general feature. Windows are often semicircular-headed, and have shafts with square capitals of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinthian</a> type, often twisted and inlaid with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> known as "cosmatesque".

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Gothic fa&ccedil;ades exhibit a variety of treatment; but in very few cases is the French form closely followed. The front of the early church of San Pedro of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> is an entirely <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> design of simple character. The fa&ccedil;ade of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> is composed in the French manner. Toledo is a mixture of Gothic and <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and the west front of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> dates from the thirteenth century, the later work being characterized by extreme, and even wild, ornamentation. Traceried open-work spires, as in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, were favoured, those at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> being worthy of attention.

<p><a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> fa&ccedil;ades agree essentially in <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> treatment, growing out of a close contact with ancient monuments, though with no strict conformity to them. Examples in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>: S. Lorenzo and Santo Spirito, in Florence; Santa Maria della Pace, S. Andrea's, The Gesu, S. Peter's, St. John Lateran's, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; S. Maria dei Miracoli, S. Zaccaria and S. Maria della Salute, in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; and the Certosa of Pavia. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>: St. Eustache, St. Etienne du Mont, the church of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, the Pantheon and the Madeleine, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. German <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>: St. Michael's at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and the Frauenkirche at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>: <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> at Salamanca; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, Santiago, <a href="../cathen/09565b.htm">Malaga</a>, and Carmona. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>: St. Paul's, London.
