<h1>Feast of Corpus Christi</h1>  

<p>(Feast of the Body of Christ)</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> on the Thursday after <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a> to <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> commemorate the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>.

<p>Of <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, which commemorates this great event, mention is made as <em>Natalis Calicis</em> (Birth of the Chalice) in the Calendar of Polemius (448) for the 24th of March, the 25th of March being in some places considered as the day of the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This day, however, was in <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, a season of sadness, during which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are expected to be occupied with thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Lord's Passion</a>. Moreover, so many other functions took place on this day that the principal event was almost lost sight of. This is mentioned as the chief reason for the introduction of the new <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Transiturus."

<p>The instrument in the hand of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> was <a href="../cathen/08556c.htm">St. Juliana</a> of <a href="../cathen/04379c.htm">Mont Cornillon</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. She was born in 1193 at Retines near <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphaned</a> at an early age, she was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian nuns</a> of <a href="../cathen/04379c.htm">Mont Cornillon</a>. Here she in time made her <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> and later became superioress. Intrigues of various kinds several times drove her from her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. She died 5 April, 1258, at the House of the <a href="../cathen/03790a.htm">Cistercian nuns</a> at Fosses, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at <a href="../cathen/15431c.htm">Villiers</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08556c.htm">Juliana</a>, from her early youth, had a great <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and always longed for a special <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. This desire is said to have been increased by a <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the appearance of the full moon having one dark spot, which signified the absence of such a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>. She made known her <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> to Robert de Thorete, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, to the learned <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Jacques Pantal&eacute;on</a>, at that time <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Pope Urban IV</a>. Bishop Robert was favourably impressed, and, since <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as yet had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of ordering <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, he called a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in 1246 and ordered the celebration to be held in the following year, also, that a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> named John should write the Office for the occasion. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is preserved in <a href="../cathen/02570c.htm">Binterim</a> (Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten, V, 1, 276), together with parts of the Office.

<p>Bishop Robert did not live to see the execution of his order, for he died 16 October, 1246; but the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was celebrated for the first time by the canons of St. Martin at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Jacques Pantal&eacute;on</a> became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> 29 August, 1261. The <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> Eve, with whom <a href="../cathen/08556c.htm">Juliana</a> had spent some time, and who was also a fervent adorer of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, now urged Henry of Guelders, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, to request the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to extend the celebration to the entire world. <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, always an admirer of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, published the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Transiturus" (8 September, 1264), in which, after having extolled the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a> as expressed in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, he ordered the annual celebration of Corpus Christi in the Thursday next after <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>, at the same time granting many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> for the attendance at Mass and at the Office. This Office, composed at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, is one of the most beautiful in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> and has been admired even by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>The death of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Pope Urban IV</a> (2 October, 1264), shortly after the publication of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, somewhat impeded the spread of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festival</a>. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> again took the matter in hand and, at the <a href="../cathen/15423a.htm">General Council of Vienne</a> (1311), once more ordered the adoption of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>. He published a new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which embodied that of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, successor of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, urged its observance.

<p>Neither <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> speaks of the theophoric <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> as a feature of the celebration. This <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a>, already held in some places, was endowed with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Popes</a> <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> and <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> had been accepted in 1306 at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; Worms adopted it in 1315; <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in 1316. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it was introduced from <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> between 1320 and 1325. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and some other countries the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> is held on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Corpus Christi is known in the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Syrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> of Galicia, Calabria, and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.
