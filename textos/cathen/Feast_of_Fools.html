<h1>Feast of Fools</h1>  

<p>A celebration marked by much license and buffoonery, which in many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and particularly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, during the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">middle ages</a> took place every year on or about the feast of the Circumcision (1 Jan.). It was known by many names &#151; festum fatuorum, festum stultorum, festum hypodiaconorum, to notice only some Latin variants &#151; and it is difficult, if not quite impossible, to distinguish it from certain other similar celebrations, such, for example, as the <a href="../cathen/01798b.htm">Feast of Asses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02725a.htm">Feast of the Boy Bishop</a>. So far as the Feast of Fools had an independent existence, it seems to have grown out of a special "festival of the subdeacons", which John Beleth, a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writer of the twelfth century and an Englishman by birth, assigns to the day of the Circumcision. He is among the earliest to draw attention to the fact that, as the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> had a special celebration on St. Stephen's day (26 Dec.), the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on St. John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist's</a> day (27. Dec.), and again the choristers and mass-servers on that of <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a> (28 Dec.), so the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> were accustomed to hold their feast about the same time of year, but more particularly on the festival of the Circumcision. This feast of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> afterwards developed into the feast of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (esclaffardi), and was later taken up by certain brotherhoods or guilds of "fools" with a definite organization of their own (Chambers, I, 373 sqq.). There can be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> &#151; and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> censors themselves freely recognized the fact &#151; that the license and buffoonery which marked this occasion had their origin in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> customs of very ancient date. John Beleth, when he discusses these matters, entitles his chapter "De quadam libertate Decembrica", and goes on to explain: "now the license which is then permitted is called Decembrian, because it was customary of old among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> that during this month slaves and serving-maids should have a sort of liberty given them, and should be put upon an equality with their masters, in celebrating a common festivity." (P.L. CCII, 123).

<p>The Feast of Fools and the almost blasphemous extravagances in some instances associated with it have constantly been made the occasion of a sweeping condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church. On the other hand some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers have thought it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to try to deny the existence of such abuses. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as Father Dreves has pointed out (Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, XLVII, 572), lies midway between these extremes. There can be no question that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority repeatedly condemned the license of the Feast of Fools in the strongest terms, no one being more determined in his efforts to suppress it than the great <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln. But these customs were so firmly rooted that centuries passed away before they were entirely eradicated. Secondly, it is equally certain that the institution did lend itself to abuses of a very serious character, even though the nature and gravity of these varied considerably at different epochs. In defense of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church one point must not be lost sight of. We possess hundreds, not to say thousands, of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of all countries and all descriptions. Amongst them the occurrence of anything which has to do with the Feast of Fools is extraordinarily rare. In <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> and breviaries we may say that it never occurs. At best a prose or a trope composed for such an occasion is here and there to be found in a gradual or an <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonary</a> (Dreves, p. 575). It is reasonable to infer from this circumstance that though these extravagances took place in church and were attached to the ordinary services, the official sanction was of the slenderest.

<p>The same conclusion follows from two well-known cases which Father Dreves has carefully studied. In 1199, Bishop Eudes de Sully imposed regulations to check the abuses committed in the celebration of the Feast of Fools on New Year's Day at Notre-Dame in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The celebration was not entirely banned, but the part of the "Lord of Misrule" or "Precentor Stultorum" was restrained within decorous limits. He was to be allowed to intone the prose "Laetemur gaudiis" in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and to wield the <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor's</a> staff, but this was to take place before the first <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of the feast were sung. Apart from this, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> offices proper were to be performed as usual, with, however, some concessions in the way of extra solemnity. During the second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, it had been the custom that the <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> of the fools should be deprived of his staff when the verse "Deposuit potentes de sede" (He hath put down the mighty from their seat) was sung at the Magnificat. Seemingly this was the dramatic moment, and the feast was hence often known as the "Festum 'Deposuit'". Eudes de Sully permitted that the staff might here be taken from the mock <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, but enacted that the verse "Deposuit" was not be repeated more than five times. A similar case of a legitimized Feast of Fools at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> c. 1220 is also examined by Father Dreves in detail. The whole text of the office is in this case preserved to us. There are many proses and interpolations (farsurae) added to the ordinary liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but nothing which could give offense as unseemly, except the prose "Orientis partibus", etc., partly quoted in the article <a href="../cathen/01798b.htm">FEAST OF ASSES</a>. This prose or "conductus", however, was not a part of the office, but only a preliminary to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> sung while the procession of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> moved from the church door to the choir. Still, as already stated, there can be no question of the reality of the abuses which followed in the wake of celebrations of this kind.

<p>The central <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> seems always to have been that of the old Saturnalia, i.e. a brief social revolution, in which power, dignity or impunity is conferred for a few hours upon those ordinarily in a subordinate position. Whether it took the form of the <a href="../cathen/02725a.htm">boy bishop</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> conducting the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> office, the parody must always have trembled on the brink of burlesque, if not of the profane. We can trace the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> at St. Gall in the tenth century, where a student, on the thirteenth of December each year, enacted the part of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. It will be sufficient here to notice that the continuance of the celebration of the Feast of Fools was finally forbidden under the very severest penalties by the Council of Basle in 1435, and that this condemnation was supported by a strongly-worded document issued by the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> in 1444, as well as by numerous decrees of various provincial councils. In this way it seems that the abuse had practically disappeared before the time of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">A very large number of monographs and papers in the proceedings of learned societies have been devoted to this subject. Many of these are quoted by CHAMBERS The Medieval Stage, I., 274-419 (London, 1903), who himself deals with the matter more exhaustively than any other writer. The best short article on the whole question, as Chambers attests, is that of DREVES, Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, XLVII, 571-587 (Freiburg, 1894). See also LEBER, Collection des meilleures dissertations, vols. IX an X (Paris, 1832); CL&Eacute;MENT, Histoire G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Musique Religeuse (Paris, 1890), pp. 122 sqq.; WALTER, Das Eselsfest (Vienna, 1885). There is also an excellent article by HEUSER in the Kirchenlex., s.v. Feste. For further bibliographical references consult CHEVALIER, Topo-bibliographie, s.v. Fous. Many articles written on the subject are more lampoons directed against the medieval Church, and betray a complete ignorance of the facts. An article entitled Festum Stultorum in the Nineteenth Century (June, 1905) is a typical specimen.</p></div>
