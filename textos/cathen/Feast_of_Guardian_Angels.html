<h1>Feast of Guardian Angels</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, like many others, was local before it was placed in the Roman calendar. It was not one of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> retained in the Pian breviary, published in 1568; but among the earliest petitions from particular churches to be allowed, as a supplement to this breviary, the canonical celebration of local <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a>, was a request from <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> in 1579 for permission to have a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian angels</a>. (B&auml;umer, "Histoire du Breviaire", II, 233.) B&auml;umer, who makes this statement on the authority of original documents published by Dr. Schmid (in the "T&uuml;binger Quartalschrift", 1884), adds on the same authority that "Toledo sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a rich <em>proprium</em> and received the desired authorization for all the Offices contained in it, <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a> also obtained the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> in February, 1582, for special Offices of the Blood of Christ and the Guardian Angels."

<p>So far the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Guardian Angels remained local. <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> placed it (27 September, 1608) among the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> of the general calendar as a double "ad libitum" (B&auml;umer, op. cit., II, 277). <a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a> gives us more details about this step. "Paul V", he writes, "gave an impetus to the veneration of <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">Guardian Angels</a> (long known in the East and West) by the authorization of a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> and proper office in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. At the request of Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, afterwards emperor, he made them <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in all regions subject to the Imperial power; to all other places he conceded them <em>ad libitum</em>, to be celebrated on the first available day after the Feast of the Dedication of St. Michael the Archangel. It is believed that the new <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was intended to be a kind of supplement to the Feast of St. Michael, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> on that day (29 September) the memory of all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as well as the memory of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Kalendarium", II, 502). Among the numerous changes made in the calendar by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> was the elevation of the Feast of Guardian Angels to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> double for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be kept on 2 October, this being the first unoccupied day after the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of St. Michael (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, op. cit., II, 503). Finally <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (5 April, 1883) favoured this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> to the extent of raising it to the rank of a double major.

<p>Such in brief is the history of a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> which, though of comparatively recent introduction, gives the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> authority to an ancient and cherished <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. The multiplicity of <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> is in fact quite a modern development, and that the <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian angels</a> were not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a special <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is no evidence that they were not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to and reverenced. There is positive testimony to the contrary (see Bareille in <em>Dict. de Theol. Cath.</em>, s.v. Ange, col. 1220). It is to be noted that the Feast of the Dedication of St. Michael is amongst the oldest <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> in the Calendar. There are five proper <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">collects</a> and <a href="../cathen/12384a.htm">prefaces</a> assigned to this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in the Leonine Sacramentary (seventh century) under the title "Natalis Basilicae Angeli in Salaria" and a glance at them will show that this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> included a commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in general, and also recognition of their protective office and <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercessory</a> power. In one <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">collect</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is asked to sustain those who are labouring in this world by the protecting power of his heavenly <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> (<em>supernorum . . . . praesidiis . . . . ministrorum</em>). In one of the prefaces, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is praised and thanked for the favour of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> patronage (<em>patrociniis . . . . angelorum</em>). In the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">collect</a> of the third Mass the <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercessory</a> power of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is alike appealed to (quae [oblatio] angelis tuis sanctisque precantibus et indulgentiam nobis referat et remedia procuret aeterna" (Sacramentarium Leonianum, ed. Feltoe, 107-8). These extracts make it plain that the substantial <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which underlies the modern <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Guardian Angels was officially expressed in the early <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. In the "Horologium magnum" of the Greeks there is a proper Office of Guardian Angels (Roman edition, 329-334) entitled "A supplicatory canon to man's Guardian Angel composed by John the Monk" (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, II, 503), which contains a clear expression of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that a <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian angel</a> is assigned to each individual. This <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is thus addressed "Since thou the power (<em>ischyn</em>) receivest my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to guard, cease never to cover it with thy wings" (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, II, 506).

<p>For 2 October there is a proper Office in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> and a proper Mass in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, which contains all the choice extracts from <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> bearing on the three-fold office of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to act as His messengers, and to watch over mortal men. "Let us praise the Lord whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> praise, whom the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> and <a href="../cathen/13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> proclaim Holy, Holy, Holy" (second antiphon of <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>). "Behold I will send my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who shall go before thee, and keep thee in thy journey, and bring thee into the place that I have prepared. Take notice of him, and hear his voice" (Exodus 23; capitulum ad Laudes). The Gospel of the Mass includes that pointed text from St. Matthew 18:10: "See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you that their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> always see the face of my Father who is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>." Although 2 October has been fixed for this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> in the Roman calendar, it is kept, by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privilege, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and many other places on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> (computed ecclesiastically) of September, and is celebrated with special solemnity and generally with an octave (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, II, 503). (See <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">ANGEL</a>; <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">INTERCESSION</a>.)
