<h1>Feast of the Circumcision</h1>  

<p>As Christ wished to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and to show His descent according to the flesh from Abraham. He, though not bound by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs21">Luke 2:21</a>), and received the sublime name expressive of His office, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, i.e. Saviour. He was, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says, "made under the law", i.e. He submitted to the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> Dispensation, "that he might redeem them who were under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>: that we might receive the adoption of sons" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4, 5</a>). "The Christ, in order to fulfil all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, was required to endure this humiliation, and bear in His body the stigma of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which He had taken upon Himself" (<a href="../cathen/06156b.htm">Fouard</a>, A Life of Jesus, tr., I, 54). The <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> took place, not in the Temple, though <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> sometimes so represent it, but in some private house, where the Holy Family had found a rather late hospitality. The public <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, which is now the usage, was introduced later. <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> was celebrated on 25 December, even in the early centuries, at least by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, whence the date was soon adopted in the East also. (See <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">CHRISTMAS</a>). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Saint Chrysostom</a> credits the West with the tradition, and St. Augustine speaks of it as well and long established. Consequently the Circumcision fell on the first of January. In the ages of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, however, the solemnization of the feast was almost impossible, on account of the orgies connected with the Saturnalian festivities, which were celebrated at the same time. Even in our own day the secular features of the opening of the New Year interfere with the religious observance of the Circumcision, and tend to make a mere holiday of that which should have the sacred character of a Holy Day. St. Augustine points out the difference between the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manner of celebrating the day: <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> feasting and excesses were to be expiated by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (P.L., XXXVIII, 1024 sqq.; Serm. cxcvii, cxcviii). The Feast of the Circumcision was kept at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a>, as is clearly indicated in a Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (567), in which he Mass of the Circumcision is prescribed (Con. Tur., II., can. xvii in Labbe, V, 857). The feast celebrated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the seventh century was not the Circumcision as such, but the octave of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. The Gelasian Sacramentary gives the title "In Octabas Domini", and prohibits the faithful from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and the profanities of the season (P.L., LXXIV, 1061). The earliest Byzantine <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> (eighth and ninth centuries) give for the first of January both the Circumcision and the anniversary of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>. The Feast of the Circumcision was observed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> before the death of St. Isidore (636), for the "Regula Monachorum", X, reads: "For it hath pleased the Fathers to appoint a holy season from the day of the Lord's birth to the day of His Circumcision" (P.L., LXXXIII, 880). It seems, therefore, that the octave was more prominent in the early centuries, and the Circumcision later.

<p>It is to be noted also that the Blessed Virgin Mary was not forgotten in the festivities of the holy season, and the Mass in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was sometimes said on this day. Today, also, while in both <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> the feast bears the title "In Circumcisione Domini et Octav Nativitatis", the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have special reference to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and in the Office, the responses and <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> set forth her privileges and extol her wonderful prerogatives. The psalms for <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> are those appointed for her feasts, and the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> keep her constantly in view. As <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> passed away the religious festivities of the Circumcision became more conspicuous and solemn; yet, even in the tenth century, <a href="../cathen/02062c.htm">Atto</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, rebuked those who profaned the holy season by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> dances, songs, and the lighting of lamps (P.L. CXXXIV, 43). (See also <a href="../cathen/11019a.htm">NEW YEAR'S DAY</a>.)
