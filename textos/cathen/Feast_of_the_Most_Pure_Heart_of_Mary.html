<h1>Feast of the Most Pure Heart of Mary</h1>  

<p>In its principal object this feast is identical with the feast of the "Inner Life of Mary", celebrated by the Sulpitians on 19 October. It commemorates the joys and sorrows of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, her virtues and perfections, her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Son</a> and her compassionate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. In a subordinate manner, its object is also the physical Heart of Mary, which, being part of her sinless and virginal body, is the symbol and sensible object representing the sentiments and virtues of Mary (see <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">DEVOTION TO THE HEART OF MARY</a>). The feast originated with Blessed John Eudes as the patronal feast of his congregations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and was, since 1644, kept at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Caen on 20 October. The office, which is very beautiful, was composed by Blessed John Eudes in 1641 but its text was not definitely fixed before 1672. In 1647 the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the feast was changed to 8 February, the feast being solemnized publicly for the first time, with the permission of Bishop Ragny, at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> on 8 February, 1648, In 1668 Cardinal Vend&ocirc;me approved the office, and the feast was adopted the same year by the French <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns of the Perpetual Adoration, and later by a number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, contrary to decrees of the Congregation of Rites prohibiting the feast of the Heart of Mary. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> claimed at this period the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to institute new feasts, and to compose offices and new breviaries without consulting the Roman authorities. In 1672 Blessed John Eudes could state that the feast had spread over nearly all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It was mostly kept on 8 February, but at the H&ocirc;telDieu of Quebec (since 1690) on 3 July, and at SaintMaclou, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, on the Sunday after 22 August (Office pr. 1765; triple of the first class).

<p>The Nuns of Notre Dame de Corbeil (8 Feb., 1787) were the first to obtain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction for the feast from <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (kept on 22 August as a double of the first class with octave). The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> later approved it for the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of Saint-Denys (8 Feb.), and for the Nuns of Fontevrault (Sunday after 2 July). On 22 March, 1799, it was granted to the city of Palermo (third Sunday after Pentecost); on 13 Aug., 1805, to the Clerics Regular of the Mother of God; in 1806 to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>; in 1807 to the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>; on 2 Sept., 1807, to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> for the Sunday after the Octave of the Assumption; on 19 Sept., 1807, to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. The city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> adopted the feast in 1879. In the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> it is observed on the Sunday within the Octave of the Assumption. The feast has not yet been extended to the entire Church. It is kept as the patronal feast of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>, of the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and of the Missionary Society of the Heart of Mary on the Sunday after 22 August. The feast is celebrated at <a href="../cathen/04403a.htm">Cosenza</a> (Calabria) on 7 February (earthquake, 1783), by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of May; in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> on the last Saturday in May; at Bologna, <a href="../cathen/11740a.htm">Pescia</a>, Volaterra etc., on the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in July; at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> on the last Sunday after Pentecost, etc. The office of Blessed John Eudes, universally used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for over a hundred years, was finally approved for the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a> (8 Feb.) in 1861. The office contained in the Appendix of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> was granted on 21 July, 1857; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Palermo, <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, <a href="../cathen/03430a.htm">Catanzaro</a>, etc., use that composed by <a href="../cathen/06366b.htm">P&egrave;re Gallifet</a> in 1726.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, refuge of sinners, is celebrated on the Sunday before <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> in Toscana, in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, etc.
