<h1>Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h1>  

<p>There are two such days: <ul><li>Friday before <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, major double; <li>third Sunday in September double of the second class.</ul> The object of these feats is the spiritual <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> and her compassion with the sufferings of her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Son</a>.

<p>(1) The seven founders of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Order, in 1239, five years after they established themselves on Monte Senario, took up the sorrows of Mary, standing under the Cross, as the principal devotion of their order. The corresponding feast, however, did not originate with them; its celebration was enacted by a provincial synod of Cologne (1413) to expiate the crimes of the iconoclast <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>; it was to be kept on the Friday after the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> under the title: "Commemoratio angustix et doloris B. Marix V.". Its object was exclusively the sorrow of Mary during the Crucifixion and Death of Christ. Before the sixteenth century this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was limited to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Scandinavia, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Being termed "Compassio" or "Transfixio", "Commendatio, Lamentatio B.M.V.", it was kept at a great variety of dates, mostly during Eastertide or shortly after Pentacost, or on some fixed day of a month (18 July, Merseburg; 19 July, Halberstadt, Lxbeck, Meissen; 20 July, Naumberg; cf. Grotefend, "Zeitrechnung", II, 2, 166). Dreves and Blume (Analecta hymnica) have published a large number of rhythmical offices, sequences and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> for the feast of the Compassion, which show that from the end of the fifteenth century in several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the scope of this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was widened to commemorate either five dolours, from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> to the burial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or seven dolours, extending over the entire life of Mary (cf. XXIV, 122-53; VIII, 51 sq.; X, 79 sq., etc.). Towards the end of the end of the sixteenth century the feast spread over part of the south of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; in 1506 it was granted to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Annunciation under the title "Spasmi B.M.V.", Monday after <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a>; in 1600 to the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Valencia, "B.M.V. sub pede Crucis", Friday before <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>. After 1600 it became popular in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and was termed "Dominx N. de Pietate", Friday before <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>. To this latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the feast was assigned for the whole <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> (1674). By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 22 April 1727, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> extended it to the entire <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, under the title "Septem dolorum B.M.V.", although the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> retain the original character of the feast, the Compassion of Mary at the foot of the Cross. At both <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> the "Stabat Mater" of Giacopone da Todi (1306) is sung.

<p>(2) The second feast was granted to the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, 9 June and 15 September, 1668, double with an octave for the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in September. Its object of the seven dolours of Mary (according to the responsories of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>: the sorrow <ul><li>at the prophecy of Simeon; <li>at the flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; <li>having lost the Holy Child at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <li>meeting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> on his way to Calvary; <li>standing at the foot of the Cross; <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being taken from the Cross; <li>at the burial of Christ.</ul>

<p>This feast was extended to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1735); to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (double of the second class with an octave, 1807). After his return from his exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> extended the feast to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> (18 September, 1814), major double); it was raised to the rank of a double of the second class, 13 May, 1908. The <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> celebrate it as a double of the first class with an octave and a vigil. Also in the Passionate Order, at Florence and <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> (N.S. de las Angustias), its rank is double of the first class with an octave. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> which are now used in the Office of this feast were probably composed by the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Callisto Palumbella (eighteenth century). On the devotion, cf. Kellner, "Heortology", p. 271. The old title of the "Compassio" is preserved by the <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Diocese of Hildesheim</a> in a simple feast, Saturday after the octave of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. A feast, "B.M.V. de pietate", with a beautiful <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> office, is kept in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sorrowful mother at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Braga in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, on the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of October; in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Rio de Janeiro in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, last Sunday of May, etc. (cf. the corresponding <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>). A special form of devotion is practised in Spanish-speaking countries under the term of "N.S. de la Soledad", to commemorate the solitude of Mary on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>. Its origin goes back to Queen Juana, lamenting the early death of her husband Philip I, King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1506).

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">oriental churches</a> these <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> are unknown; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> keep a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the sorrowful Mother on Friday after the octave of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>.
