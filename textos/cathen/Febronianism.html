<h1>Febronianism</h1>  

<p>The politico-ecclesiastical system outlined by <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim</a>, Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, under the pseudonym Justinus Febronius, in his work entitled "Justini Febronii Juris consulti de Stata Ecclesi&aelig; et legitim&acirc; potestate Romani Pontificis Liber singularis ad reuniendos dissidentes in religione christianos compositus" (Bullioni apud Guillelmum Evrardi, 1763; in reality the work was published by Esslinger at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>). Taking as a basis the Gallican principles which he had imbibed from the canonist Van Espen while pursuing his studies in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim</a> advanced along the same lines, in spite of many inconsistencies, to a radicalism far outstripping traditional Gallicanism. He develops in this work a theory of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization founded on a denial of the monarchical constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The ostensible purpose was to facilitate the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by diminishing the power of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>According to Febronius (cap. i), the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> was entrusted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which holds it <em>principaliter et radicaliter</em>, but exercises it through her <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, to whom only the administration of this power is committed. Among these the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> comes first, though even he is subordinate to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a whole. The Divine institution of the primacy in the church is acknowledged (cap. ii), but Febronius holds that its connexion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> does not rest on the authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but on that of Peter and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the power to attach it to another see. The power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, therefore, should be confined to those essential <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> inherent in the primacy which were exercised by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> during the first eight centuries. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the centre with which the individual Churches must be united. He must be kept informed of what is taking place everywhere throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he may exercise the care demanded by his office for the preservation of unity. It is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to enforce the observance of the canons in the whole Church; he has the authority to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to depute <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to exercise his authority as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>. His power, as head of the whole Church, however, is of an administrative and unifying character, rather than a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. But since the ninth century, chiefly through the influence of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals of Pseudo-Isidore</a>, the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has undergone a complete transformation, in that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority has been extended beyond proper bounds (cap. iii). By a violation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, questions which at one time were left to the decision of <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> gradually came to be reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (cap. iv), as, for instance, the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, the confirmation of episcopal elections, the naming of coadjutors with the right of succession, the transfer and removal of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the establishment of new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and the erection of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> is expressly denied (cap. v), cannot, on his own authority, without a council or the assent of the entire episcopate, give forth any decisions on matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of universal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Likewise in matters of discipline, he can issue no decrees affecting the whole body of the faithful; the decrees of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> have binding power only after their acceptance by the individual churches. Laws once <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> cannot be altered at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> will or pleasure. It is also denied that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by the nature and authority of the primacy, can receive appeals from the whole Church.

<p>According to Febronius, the final court of appeal in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> (cap. vi), the fights of which exclude the pretended monarchical constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is subordinate to the general council; he has neither the exclusive authority to summon one, nor the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to preside at its sessions, and the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees do not need his ratification. Ecumenical councils are of absolute necessity, as even the assent of a majority of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, if given by the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, outside a council, does not constitute a final, irrevocable decision. Appeal from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> is justified by the superiority of the council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. According to the Divine institution of the episcopate (cap. vii), all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; they do not receive their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It is not within the province of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to exercise ordinary episcopal functions in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> other than that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> reservations regarding the granting of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, annates, and the exemption of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are thus in conflict with the primitive law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and must be abolished. Having shown, as he believes, that the existing ecclesiastical law with reference to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power is a distortion of the original constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, due chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a>, Febronius demands that the primitive discipline, as outlined by him, be everywhere restored (cap. viii). He then suggests as means for bringing about this reformation (cap. ix), that the people shall be properly enlightened on this subject, that a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> with full freedom be held, that <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a> be convened, but especially that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers take concerted action, with the cooperation and advice of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that secular princes avail themselves of the <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">Regium Placet</a> to resist decrees, that obedience be openly refused to a legitimate extent, and finally that <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> be appealed to through the <em>Appellatio ab abusu</em>. The last measures reveal the real trend of Febronian principles; Febronius, while ostensibly contending for a larger independence and greater authority for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, seeks only to render the Churches of the different countries less dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in order to facilitate the establishment of national Churches in these states, and reduce the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to a condition in which they would be merely servile creatures of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Wherever an attempt was made to put his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> into execution, it proceeded along these lines.



<p>The book was formally condemned, 27 February, 1764, by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 21 May, 1764, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> required the German episcopate to suppress the work. Ten <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, among them the Elector of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, complied. Meanwhile no steps had been taken against the author personally, who was well known in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Despite the ban of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the book, harmonizing as it did with the spirit of the times, had a tremendous success. A second edition, revised and enlarged, was issued as early as 1765; it was reprinted at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and Zurich, and translations appeared in German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. In the three later volumes, which <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim</a> issued as supplementary to the original work, and numbered II to IV (Vol. II, Frankfort and Leipzig, 1770; Vol. III, 1772; Vol. IV, Parts 1 and 2, 1773-74), he defended it, under the name of Febronius and various other pseudonyms, against a series of attacks. Later he published an abridgment under the title: "Justinus Febronius abbreviatus et emendatus" (Cologne and Frankfort, 1777). In addition to the "Judicium academicum" of the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a> (1765), refutations appeared from a large number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors, the most important being: <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, "De vi ac ratione primatus Romanorum Pontificum et de ipsorum infallibilitate in definiendis controversiis fidei" (Verona, 1766); Idem, "De potestate ecclesiastic&acirc; Summorum Pontifleum et Conciliorum generalium liber, una cum vindiciis auctoritatis pontifici&aelig; contra opus Just. Febronii (Verona, 1768; Augsburg, 1770; new ed. of both works, M&uuml;nster in W., 1845, 1847); Zaccaria, "Antifebronio, ossia apologia polemicostorica del primato del Papa, contra la dannata opera di Giust. Febronio" (2 vols., Pesaro, 1767; 2nd ed., 4 vols., Cesena, 1768-70; tr. German, Reichenberger, Augsburg, 1768); Idem, "Antifebronius vindicatus" (4 vols., Cesena, 1771-2); Idem, "In tertium Justini Febronii tomum animadversiones Romano-catholic&aelig;" (Rome, 1774); Mamachi, "Epistol&aelig; ad Just. Febronium de ratione regend&aelig; christian&aelig; reipublic&aelig; deque legitim&acirc; Romani Pontificis potestate" (3 vols., Rome, 1776-78). There were, besides, refutations written from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> standpoint, to repudiate the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that a diminution of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power was all that was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to bring the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> back into union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for instance Karl Friedrich Bahrdt, "Dissertatio de eo, an fieri possit, ut sublato Pontificio imperio reconcilientur Dissidentes in religione Christiani" (Leipzig, 1763), and Johann Friedrich Bahrdt, "Do Roman&acirc; Ecclesi&acirc; irreconciliabili" (Leipzig, 1767); Karl Gottl. Hofmann, "Programma continens examen regul&aelig; exegetic&aelig; ex Vincentio Lerinensi in Febronio repetit&aelig;" (Wittenberg, 1768).

<p>The first measures against the author were taken by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, who urged Clemens Wenzeslaus, Elector of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, to prevail on <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim</a> to recall the work. Only after prolonged exertions, and after a retractation, couched in general terms, had been adjudged unsatisfactory in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the elector forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim's</a> emended recantation (15 November, 1778). This was communicated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in consistory by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>. That this retractation was not sincere on <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim's</a> part is evident from his subsequent movements. That he had by no means relinquished his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> appears from his "Justini Febronii Jcti. Commentarius in suam Retractationem Pio VI. Pont. Max. Kalendis Nov. anni 1778 submissam" (Frankfort, 1781; German ed., Augsburg, 1781), written for the purpose of justifying his position before the public. Meanwhile; notwithstanding the prohibition, the "Febronius" had produced its pernicious effects, which were not checked by the retractation. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> advanced in the work, being in thorough accord with the absolutistic tendencies of civil rulers, were eagerly accepted by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> courts and governments of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Austrian <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; and they received further development at the hands of court <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists who favoured the scheme of a national Church. Among the advocates of the theory of Febronianism in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> professor, Franz Anton Haubs, "Themata ex histori&acirc; ecclesiastic&acirc; de hierarchi&acirc; sacr&acirc; primorum V s&aelig;culorum" (Trier, 1786); "Systema prim&aelig;vum de potestate episcopali ejusque applicatio ad episcopalia qu&aelig;dam jura in specie punctationibus I. II. et IV. congressus Emsani exposita" (Trier, 1788); and Wilhelm Joseph Castello, "Dissertatio historica de variis causis, queis accidentalis Romani Pontificis potestas successive ampliata fuit" (Trier, 1788). It was the Austrian canonists, however, who contributed most towards the compilation of a new law code regulating the relations of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, which was reduced to practice under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. Especially noteworthy as being conceived in this spirit were the textbooks on canon law prescribed for the Austrian <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and compiled by Paul Joseph von Riegger, "Institutiones juris ecclesiastici" (4 vols., Vienna, 1768-72; frequently reprinted), and Pehem, "Pr&aelig;lectiones in jus ecclesiasticum universum", also, in a more pronounced way, the work of Johann Valentin Eybel, "Introductia in jus ecclesiasticum Catholicorum" (4 vols., Vienna, 1777; placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>, 1784).

<p>The first attempt to give Febronian principles a practical application was made in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> at the Coblenz Conference of 1769, where the three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Electors of Mains, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, through their delegates, and under the directions of <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim</a>, compiled a list of thirty grievances against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, in consonance with the principles of the "Febronius" (Gravamina trium Archiepiscoporum Electorum, Moguntinensis, Trevirensis et Coloniensis contra Curiam Apostolicam anno 1769 ad C&aelig;sarem delata; printed in Le Bret, "Magazin zum Gebrauch der Staaten- und Kirchengeschichte", Pt. VIII, Ulm, 1783, pp. 1-21). More significant was the Ems Congress of 1786, at which the three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> electors and the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, in imitation of the Coblenz Congress, and in conformity with the basic principles of the "Febronius", made a fresh attempt to readjust the relations of the German Church with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with a view to securing for the former a greater measure of independence; they also had their representatives draw up the Ems Punctation in twenty-three articles; they achieved, however, no practical results. An attempt was made to realize the principles of the "Febronius" on a large scale in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, where under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> a national Church was established according to the plan outlined. Efforts in the same direction were made by Joseph's brother Leopold in his Grand-Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. The resolutions adopted at the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a>, under Bishop Scipio Ricci, along these lines, were repudiated by the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the country.
