<h1>Federico Borromeo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, cousin and successor of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> 16 August, 1564; died there, 22 September, 1631. He was the son of Giulio Cesare Borromeo and Margherita Trivulzio, members of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> aristocracy. He studied successively at Bologna and Pavia, in which latter city he was the first pupil of the Borromeo College. Eater he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for higher studies and was there strongly influenced by <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, and Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. In 1580 he began his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at the age of twenty-three, in 1587, by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>; and, in 1595, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, who personally <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him to this high office. During thirty-six years he gave the world an example of episcopal virtue, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and dignity. He was tireless in preaching and in instructing both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, was an apostle of religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and persistent reformer of all abuses, both lay and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. An almost constant conflict with the local <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> authorities, suspicious and haughty by nature, did not diminish his sweetness of temper nor his patience; the traditional <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> and authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order were defended as an inheritance of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> that he dared not abandon. <a href="../cathen/12798b.htm">Von Reumont</a> thinks that, though often right, he went at times too far, e.g. in the assertion of minute ceremonial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; it may be said, however, that in all probability it was the principle and substance of customary <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> that the fearless <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> ever intended to preserve and hand down. His affection for the people of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was made evident during the great famine and pest of 1627-28, when he fed daily 2,000 poor at the gates of his residence, and was personally an example of such absolute heroism that nearly one hundred of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (sixty-two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and thirty-three vicars) gave up their lives in attendance on the perishing multitudes. <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Allessandro Manzoni</a> has immortalized this extraordinary devotion in his "I Promessi Sposi" (The Betrothed). If Cardinal Borromeo shared the current excessive credulity in <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> and magic, he was in every other way far in advance of his time as a friend of the people and a promoter of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture and social refinement based on a practical <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He is the founder of the famous <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> opened by him in 1609, as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of writers, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of savants, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and after the Bodleian at Oxford the first genuinely public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The cares of a thickly populated diocese did not prevent him from acquiring great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> erudition or from composing some seventy-one printed and forty-six <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> books written mostly in Latin that treat of various ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. The universal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of his own and later times is echoed in the following words from the above-mentioned work of <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Manzoni</a>, engraved on the pedestal of the marble <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> that the citizens of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> erected in 1685 before the gates of the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosiana Library</a>; "He was one of those men rare in every age, who employed extraordinary intelligence, the resources of an opulent condition, the advantages of privileged station, and an unflinching will, in the search and practice of higher and better things."
