<h1>Federigo Fregoso</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, about 1480; d. 22 July, 1541; belonged to the Fregosi, one of the four great burgess <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> who from the end of the fourteenth century gave many doges to the republic. Federigo was the son of Agostino Fregoso, governor of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1488 for Ludovic Moro, and of Gentilla de Montefeltre, niece of Guidobaldo, Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. His brother, Ottaviano, was Doge of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. Having spent his youth at the court of his uncle, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, he took <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and in 1507 received from <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. But the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> having refused to recognize him because of his sympathies with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> promised him the <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">See of Gubbio</a>. At the court of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, Federigo had received a good classical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and had allied himself with such <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> as <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> and <a href="../cathen/03409c.htm">Baldassare Castiglione</a>. Every day he withdrew himself from his occupations in order to devote several hours to the study of the ancients. Nevertheless, circumstances were to make him a man of action.

<p>In 1510, after the troubles in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and the victory of the Adorni, Federigo was exiled and compelled to seek refuge at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Three years later, the Fregosi returned to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, Ottaviano was elected Doge, and Federigo, having become his chief counsellor, was placed at the head of the army, and defended the republic against internal dangers (revolts of the Adorni and the Fieschi) and external dangers (suppression of the Barbary piracy). Cortogoli, a corsair from <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, blockaded the coast with a squadron, and within a few days had captured eighteen merchantmen. Being given the command of the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet, in which <a href="../cathen/05134b.htm">Andrea Doria</a> was serving, Federigo surprised Cortogoli before Bizerta, effected a descent on the island of Djerba and returned to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> with great booty. The Fregosi had recognized <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I, King of France</a>, as Lord of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. In 1522, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> besieged the city. Federigo directed the defence and was wounded. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> having taken the city by assault, he was compelled to seek safety on a French vessel. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> accorded him a warm reception and gave him the Abbey of St. Benignus at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>. Here he devoted himself to the study of Greek and Hebrew, but he had quarrels with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who could not endure his severity, and he returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1529 he resigned the <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">See of Salerno</a> and was named <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>. In 1539 <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> made him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, with the title of St. John and St. Paul. He died at <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, in 1541, mourned by the people of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, who had named him, "the father of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>". He wrote several edifying works, and some of his letters are in the collections of <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> and <a href="../cathen/03409c.htm">Baldassare Castiglione</a>.
