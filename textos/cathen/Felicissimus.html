<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Felicissimus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Carthage who, in the middle of the third century, headed a short-lived but dangerous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, to which undue <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> importance has been given by a certain class of writers, Neander, <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, Harnack, and others, who see in it "a presbyterial reaction against episcopal autocracy". Of the chief figure in the revolt, Felicissimus, not much can be said. The movement of which he was afterwards the leader originated in the opposition of five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the church in Carthage to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> election as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. One of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, Novatus, selected Felicissimus as <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of his church in the district called Mons, and because of the importance of the office of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in the African Church, Felicissimus became the leader of the malcontents. The opposition of this faction, however, led to no open rupture until after the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in 250, when <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> was compelled to flee from the city. His absence created a situation favourable to his adversaries, who took advantage of a division already existing in regard to the methods to be followed in dealing with those who had <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> (<em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em>) during <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and who afterwards sought to be readmitted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellowship. It was easy under the circumstances to arouse much hostility to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, because he had followed an extremely rigorous policy in dealing with those <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>. The crisis was reached when <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> sent from his place of hiding a commission consisting of two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to distribute <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to those who had been ruined during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Felicissimus, regarding the activities of these men as an encroachment on the prerogatives of his office, attempted to frustrate their mission. This was reported to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, who at once <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him. Felicissimus immediately gathered around him all those who were dissatisfied with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> treatment of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a> and proclaimed an open revolt. The situation was still further complicated by the fact that the thirty years' peace preceding the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had caused much laxity in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that on the first outbreak of hostilities multitudes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had openly <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> or resorted to the expedient of purchasing certificates from the venal officials, attesting their compliance with the emperor's edict. Besides this the custom of readmitting <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellowship, if they could show tickets from confessors or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in their behalf, had resulted in widespread <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>.

<p>While <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> was in exile he did not succeed in checking the revolt even though he wisely refrained from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> those who differed from in regard to the treatment of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>. After his return to Carthage (251) he convoked a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in which the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against Felicissimus and the heads of faction was reaffirmed, and in which definite rules were laid down regarding the manner of readmitting the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>. The sentence against Felicissimus and his followers did not deter them from appearing before another council, which was held in Carthage the following year, and demanding that the case be reopened. Their demand was refused, and they sought to profit by the division in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> which had arisen from similar causes, except that in this case the charge of laxity was levelled against the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party. This proceeding and the fact that the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> had decided with so much moderation in regard to the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>, modifying as it did the rigoristic policy of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> by a judicious compromise, soon detached from Felicissimus all his followers, and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> disappeared.
