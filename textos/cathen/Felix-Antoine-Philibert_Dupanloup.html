<h1>Felix-Antoine-Philibert Dupanloup</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, b. at Saint-F&eacute;lix; Savoie, 2 June, 1802; d. at Lacombe, Is&egrave;re, 11 October, 1878. His mother, Anne Dechosal, to whom he ever remained tenderly devoted, gave him his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The better to screen his future from the disgrace of his <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a>, she took him when only seven years old to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where, by dint of work and privations, she succeeded in keeping him for some time at the Coll&egrave;ge Sainte-Barbe. After various attempts in other directions, F&eacute;lix chose the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, studying grammar at the <em>Petite Communaut&eacute;,</em> humanities at the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet, philosophy at Issy, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Saint-Sulpice. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 18 Dec., 1825, he went as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> to the Madeleine where he founded the famous Cat&eacute;chismes de l'Assomption and the Acad&eacute;mie de St-Hyacinthe, being entrusted meanwhile with the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the Duc de Bordeaux and of the Princes d'Orl&eacute;ans. The novelty and success of his catechizing methods drew upon him the ill will of his <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Transferred to Saint-Roch (1834), he soon won a reputation as <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator and director. As superior of the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint-Nicolas (1837-45), he so completely transformed the institution that admission into it was eagerly sought by members of the best <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. "During those few years", says Renan, himself a pupil of Saint-Nicolas (Souvenirs d'enfance et de jeunesse), "the old house of the rue St-Victor became the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> which sheltered the greatest number of historical or well-known names." At Saint-Nicolas Dupanloup was truly the ideal educator later described in his famous book: "La haute &eacute;ducation intellectuelle". Absorbed as he was in his professional work, he did not completely give up the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Through one of his penitents, Pauline de P&eacute;rigord, he brought about the conversion of Talleyrand (1838). A course in sacred eloquence which he had brilliantly inaugurated at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> was discontinued after the eleventh lecture, owing to the excitement occasioned by the lecturer's severe criticism of Voltaire and Villemain's unwillingness to enforce order. In 1844, in connexion with the Villemain <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> bill, which was scarcely more satisfactory to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> than its numerous predecessors, Dupanloup inaugurated with <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> and <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Ravignan</a> that long struggle for liberty of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which resulted in the <em>loi Falloux.</em> It was at his suggestion that <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Ravignan</a> wrote "De l'existence et de l'institut des J&eacute;suites", in order to put down the still active bugbear of the <em>hommes noirs</em> called up by B&eacute;renger. He also actively supported <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> in the formation of the Committee for the Defence of Religious Liberty, and when later Thiers spoke in favour of another unacceptable <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> bill, Dupanloup wrote in reply "Des associations religieuses", a pamphlet which became later the book "De la pacification religieuse". A difference of views with <a href="../cathen/01180a.htm">Archbishop Affre</a>, in connexion with the above-mentioned polemics and the direction of Saint-Nicolas, ended in Dupanloup's transfer from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to a canonicate at Notre-Dame, 1845.

<p>The four years of his canonicate were by no means years of leisure. In spite of his increasing activity in confessional and <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, he found time for public interests. The elections of 1846 sent to the French Parliament some 150 deputies friendly to liberty of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and for these Dupanloup wrote "L'&eacute;tat de la question", a moderate but clear assertion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claims. As the Salvandy project of 1847 fell short of these claims, he again published a series of pamphlet "Du nouveau projet de loi", "Des petits-s&eacute;minaires", among others; and the better to control public opinion, he undertook the work of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily paper finally purchasing "L'ami de la religion". In 1848 when Falloux, yielding to Dupanloup's persuasion, accepted a portfolio under <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">President Louis Napoleon</a>, he appointed a commission to draft an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> bill, and made Dupanloup a member. Dupanloup's courtesy and undeniable competence won over to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> view such men as <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">Thiers</a> and Cousin, thus insuring the enactment of 1850. "He made me minister against my will", said Falloux speaking of Dupanloup; "I have made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> against his will." Appointed to the <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">See of Orl&eacute;ans</a>, he took possession of it 11 Dec., 1849, and during the twenty-eight years of his episcopate showed incredible activity. His administration, minutely described by Cochard, touched on every vital interest of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: the holding of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> visitations, organization of <em>cat&eacute;chismes</em> and <em>petits-s&eacute;minaires</em> along the lines adopted in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, development of charitable works, encouragement of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, completion of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Ste-Croix, introduction of the Roman Liturgy, etc. Still his energy was not exhausted. Wherever the interests of religion were at stake, he gave them vigorous support. In the question of the classics he stood for the broader view and entered upon a lively discussion with <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>. Profiting by his membership in the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>, to which he had been elected 8 May, 1854, Dupanloup prevented the award of the <em>prix Bodin</em> to Taine's "History of English Literature<em>"</em> and opposed the admission of <a href="../cathen/09295b.htm">Littr&eacute;</a> into that body. The reorganization of "Le Correspondant", with Falloux, Foisset, <a href="../cathen/04078b.htm">Cochin</a>, and de Broglie at its head, was also largely his work. The <em>Pucelle d'Orl&eacute;ans</em> (<a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Jeanne d'Arc</a>) found in him an ardent champion; twice he pronounced her panegyric at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and it was he who introduced in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the cause of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> and raised the first funds towards a new monument in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.



<p>Dupanloup was always held in high esteem by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> people. In 1862, on the occasion of one of the periodical <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> famines, he preached a charity sermon in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-Roch at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which netted the sum of thirty thousand francs. The grateful <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> returned this with interest during the Franco-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> when they remitted to the eloquent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> the sum of two hundred thousand francs in response to his appeal for the needs of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On the occasion of the centenary (1875) of Daniel O'Connell, whom he had always admired and often praised publicly, Dupanloup was formally invited by the centenary authorities to take part in the celebration. Though too ill at the time to accept the honourable invitation, he wrote in reply two letters, memorable for their eloquence, to the Lord-Mayor of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> arid to <a href="../cathen/09484a.htm">Cardinal McCabe</a>, and which were printed in "Le Monde", 9 and 10 Aug., 1875 (Lagrange, Vie de Dupanloup, Paris, 1894, II, 347-48; III, 317). His "Letter on Slavery", written on the occasion of the Civil War in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is another evidence of Dupanloup's broad sympathy, and helps to account tor his popularity in English-speaking countries.

<p>Dupanloup's main efforts, however, were directed towards the defence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, menaced in its independence by the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and the ill-disguised connivance of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>. Salomon says (Mgr Dupanloup, p. 58): "For eight years, he did not lay down his arms. From Villafranca to Mentana, he never took off his breast-plate." During this phase of his life, besides endeavouring to enlist pontifical zouaves and to increase the <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a>, he wrote the "Protestation", against the impending spoliation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; the "Lettre &agrave; un catholique sur la brochure 'Le pape et gcongr&egrave;s'"; "La souverainet&eacute; pontificale", in which he cited a declaration made by Cousin in favour of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; two other pamphlets, one against the Convention of 15 Sept., 1864, and the other in defence of the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of 8 Dec. and of the Syllabus; several letters to Ratazzi, Minghetti, etc. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and the Franco-Prussian War exhibit Dupanloup in two very different lights. At the council he was the leader of that minority which for political reasons stood, if not against the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> itself, at least against the opportuneness of its definition. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of indiction, in which no mention was made of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, he welcomed with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and transmitted to his flock in a dignified pastoral letter; but when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiment, voiced by such organs as the "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica" and the "Univers", began to petition for the definition, he appended to his pastoral letter certain <em>observations</em> which, by making known in advance the position he intended to take, involved him in a petty controversy with <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>. Once in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he never swerved from his position but used all the resources of his fiery nature to win others over to his views. It was he who, on the eve of the final vote, advised the minority to vote neither <em>placet</em> nor <em>non-placet,</em> but to abstain and withdraw. That he appealed to the secular arm and threatened the council with diplomatic intervention has been both asserted and denied. This much is vouched for by Ollivier, then minister of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>: "No <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the minority, Dupanloup or other, ever demanded the evacuation of the pontifical territory" (Le Correspondant, 10 Dec., 1892). In <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to him it should be added that, once the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> was defined, he was neither slow to acquiesce in what he called "the victory of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" nor half-hearted in declaring his adherence. During the Franco-Prussian War Dupanloup showed himself a worthy successor of Saint-Aignan and like him won the title of <em>defensor civitatis</em>. His prestige enabled him to have the severe conditions imposed by the victors on the city of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> either withdrawn or mitigated. In gratitude his people sent him to the National Assembly. As a member he took an effective part in securing the passage of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which restored the military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> (1874) and of that which authorized the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutes (1875). He was made Senator in 1875, and one of his last public acts was to deter the French Government from officially taking notice of the centenary of Voltaire (1878). A malady which had long undermined his health resulted in his death while at the ch&acirc;teau Lacombe. His remains were laid to rest in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and his heart conveyed to Saint-F&eacute;lix, his native place. As a clause of his last will forbade any funeral oration, <a href="../cathen/02710c.htm">Bishop Bougaud</a> pronounced only a few words of eulogy, the oration being delivered in 1888 by Bishop Besson at the unveiling of Dupanloup's monument.

<p>Dupanloup was without question one of the ablest <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his day. He repeatedly refused higher positions. In many things a conservative and even a legitimist, he was one of the first who thought of appealing, in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, to <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> and public liberties before a generation no longer able or willing to recognize the Divine right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The criticisms passed on him by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of a different, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were more than offset by numerous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Briefs</a> of encouragement and episcopal letters of approval from all parts of the world. A man of action, he was also a prolific writer. A complete list of his writings is given by Lagrange, his biographer. Some of his polemical pamphlets have already been noticed. In his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> writings Dupanloup enunciates some of the most important principles which are now generally accepted. Among these are his conception of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> as a process of developing <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> activity instead of injecting <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> into the mind, and his; insistence on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the teacher to respect the freedom of the pupils and to cultivate; in them a spirit of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He advocates physical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by means of games, and warns against the danger of forcing precocious children. Education, he holds, is <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, moral, religious, and physical; but it is essentially one, and to neglect any of its purposes would be fatal.

<p>His more important works are:-- <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a>: "L'oeuvre par excellence" (1869); <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>: "L'&eacute;ducation en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral", "La haute &eacute;ducation intellectuelle" (1850), "La femme studieuse" (1869), and "Lettres sur l'&eacute;ducation des filles" (1878); historical: "Vie de Mgr Borderies" (Paris, 1904); oratorical: panegyrics of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Jeanne d'Arc</a> (1855 and 1869), St. Martin (1862), and <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> (1863); funeral orations of P&egrave;re de Ravignan (1858), the volunteers (1860), Mgr Menjaud (1861), and Lamorici&egrave;re (1865); pastoral: "Lettres pastorales et mandements" (in the archives of the episcopal palace of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>).
