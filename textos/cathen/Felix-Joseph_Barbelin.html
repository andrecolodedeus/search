<h1>Felix-Joseph Barbelin</h1>  

<p>Styled the "apostle of Philadelphia", b. at Luneville, Province of Alsace, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 30 May, 1808; d. in Philadelphia, 8 June, 1869. He was the oldest of six children, of whom five became religious, his youngest brother Ignace-Xavier being the founder of the Apostolic School at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>. He received his early training at the home of a reverend grand-uncle, and made his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of which another grand-uncle was president. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 7 January, 1831, at Whitemarsh, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, U. S. A., and for some years was stationed at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>, D. C., as disciplinarian and teacher of French. In 1836 he became assistant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> Church at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, and in 1838 was transferred to Philadelphia, thereafter the scene of his apostolic labours. For more than a quarter of a century he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Old St. Joseph's, Willing's Alley, which became, mainly during his term of office, the centre from which radiated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influences throughout the city and diocese. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was untiring. He founded St. Joseph's Hospital in his adopted city, and was the first to establish sodalities for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and for the young who were always the objects of his fatherly solicitude. In 1852 he was appointed the first President of St. Joseph's College. His many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> brought him into contact with most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city, while his charity towards all and particularly his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of children and devotion to their interests made him an object of veneration to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> alike. His memory is still held in benediction.
