<h1>Felix Hemmerlin</h1>  

<p>(MALLEOLUS) properly HEMERLI

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> at Solothurn, in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, in 1388 or 1389; died about 1460. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the collegiate church of his native town, and afterwards entered the University of Erfurt, whence in 1408 he betook himself to the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>, where he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for four years. At the beginning of 1412 he became a canon of the collegiate church of Sts. Felix and Regula at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. A little later a similar dignity was conferred upon him from the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mauritius, in Zofingen. In 1413 we find him once more at the University of Erfurt, where he won the degree of Bachelor of Canon Law. Soon after this he took part in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>. He identified himself there with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Reform party, the principles of which were thenceforth to govern his religious activities and his attitude in matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy. He became, in 1421, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> (<em>pr&oelig;positus</em>) of the collegiate church of <a href="../cathen/15230a.htm">St. Ursus</a> at Solothurn. As such he undertook to reform the collegiate <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, drew up new regulations bearing on Divine service on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and the life of choir-members, and even defended energetically the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the collegiate church against the municipal authorities. Two years later he returned to the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>, from which he obtained in the year which followed the degrees of Licentiate and Doctor of Canon Law. His doctorate certificate is still in existence and is preserved in the public museum at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. It is the most ancient doctorate diploma known to exist today in the original. His learning covered a very wide field. Besides his legal studies he had taken up ancient languages and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Greek and Hebrew. On his return to Solothurn he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1430. He had great hopes of the Council of Basle, and took part in the deliberations which preceded the general sessions of the council, as well as in the debates with the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. He also espoused at the outset the cause of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Felix against <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. But the subsequent proceedings of the council offended him, and he became dissatisfied with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions of his day. Meanwhile he reformed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the collegiate church of Zofingen. In January, 1439, he undertook the reform of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, where as early as 1428 he had become cantor. But here he met strenuous opposition. After he had written a violent pamphlet against the mode of living in this community, several members of the choir formed a plot against him, and he was seriously wounded. He recovered, however, and renewed his attacks against <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses.

<p>Hemmerlin composed more than thirty polemical treatises on various subjects, the chief of which were directed against the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a>, and even against <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In politics, too, he sided earnestly with his native city, <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, allied with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederates. He attacked the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> most <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> in his work entitled: "De nobilitate et rusticitate" (completed in 1450). In this way he made numerous enemies, who sought a favourable opportunity to avenge themselves. In 1456 a popular celebration in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the reconciliation of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> with the people of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> was made the occasion of a popular outcry against Hemmerlin. He was seized in his own house, delivered to the Vicar-general of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and was condemned by the episcopal court in that place to the loss of his canonicate at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> and to lifelong confinement. He was taken to Lucerne and underwent a mild <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of that place. Numerous writings employed his time at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, and eventually he exchanged his provostship at Solothurn for the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Penthaz in the Diocese of Lausanne. Only a portion of his works have been printed. An edition appeared at Basic (s. d.) prepared by Sebastian Brant, and another at the same place in 1497. There is not the slightest justification for the attempt to present Hemmerlin as a forerunner of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>.
