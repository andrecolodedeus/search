<h1>Felix II</h1>  

<p>Pope (more properly <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">Antipope</a>), 355-358; d. 22 Nov., 365.

<p>In 355 <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> was banished to Beraea in Thrace by the Emperor Constantius because he upheld tenaciously the Nicene definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and refused to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius of Alexandria</a>. The Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> pledged itself in <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">solemn conclave</a> not to acknowledge any other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> while <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> was alive. ("Marcellini et Fausti Libellus precum", no.1 : "Quae gesta sunt inter Liberium et Felicem episcopos" in "Collectio Avellana", ed. Gunter; Hieronymus, "Chronicon", ad an. Abr. 2365). The emperor, however, who was supplanting the exiled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> tendencies, exerted himself to install a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> in place of the banished <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>. He invited to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> Felix, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; on the latter's arrival, <a href="../cathen/01081a.htm">Acacius of Caesarea</a> succeeded in inducing him to accept the office from which <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> had been forcibly expelled, and to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Acacius and two other <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The majority of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> acknowledged the validity of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> but the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> would have nothing to do with him and remained true to the banished but lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>When Constantius visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in May, 357, the people demanded the recall of their rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> who, in fact, returned soon after signing the third formula of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, assembled in that city of Lower Pannonia, wrote to Felix and the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> advising there to receive <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> in all charity and to put aside their dissensions; it was added that L.iberius and Felix should together govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The people received their legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with great enthusiasm, but a great commotion rose against Felix, who was finally driven from the city. Soon after, he attempted, with the help of his adherents to occupy the Basilica Julii (Santa Maria in Trastevere), but was finally banished in perpetuity by unanimous vote of the Senate and the people. He retired to the neighbouring Porto, where he lived quietly till his death. <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> permitted the members of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, including the adherents of Felix, to retain their positions. Later legend confound the relative positions of Felix and <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acta Felicis" and "Acta Liberii", as well as in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a>, Felix was portrayed as a saint and confessor of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. This distortion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> facts originated most probably through confusion of this Felix with another Felix, a Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of an earlier date.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, which may be registering here a reliable tradition, Felix built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> on the via Aurelia. It is well known that on this road was buried a Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Felix; hence it seems not improbable that apropos of both there arose a confusion (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/06029b.htm">FELIX I</a>) through which the real story of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> was lost and he obtained in local Roman history the status of a saint and a confessor. As such he appears in the Roman Martyrology on 29 July.
