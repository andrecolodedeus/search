<h1>Felix V</h1>  

<p>Regnal name of Amadeus of Savoy, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">Antipope</a> (1440-1449).

<p>Born 4 December, 1383, died at Ripaille, 7 January, 1451. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a>, having declared the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, deposed, proceeded immediately with the election of an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Wishing to secure additional influence and increased financial support, they turned their attention towards the rich and powerful prince, Duke Amadeus VIII of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Amadeus had exercised over his dependencies a mild and equitable sway, and had evinced a great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially in connection with the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> succession, brought to a close by the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>. Emperor Sigismund had shown his appreciation of this ruler's services by raising, in 1416, the former counts of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> to the status of a duchy, and in 1422 conferred on Amadeus the county of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. On the death of his wife, Maria of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Duke Amadeus resolved to lead henceforth a life of contemplation, without however entirely resigning the government of his territories. He appointed his son Ludwig regent of the duchy, and retired to Ripaille on the Lake of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, where in company with five <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> whom he had formed into an Order of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, he led a semi-monastic life in accordance with a rule drawn up by himself.

<p>Amadeus had been in close relations with the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> council of Basle; and was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 30 October, 1439, by the electoral college of that council, including one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (d'Allamand of Arles), eleven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, five <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and nine canonists. After long negotiations with a deputation from the council, Amadeus acquiesced in the election, 5 Feb., 1440, completely renouncing at the same time all further participation in the government of his duchy. Ambition and a certain fantastic turn of character induced him to take this step. He took the name of Felix V, and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the Cardinal d'Allamand, 24 July, 1440. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> had already <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, 23 March, at the council of Florence. Until 1442, the famous Aeneas Sylvinus Piccolomini, later <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, was the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope's</a> secretary. This renewal of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> ruined any success of Basle assembly, just closed at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. Subsequently, Amadeus took up his residence in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; his efforts to surround himself with a curia met with little success; many of those whom he named <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> declined the dignity. He found general recognition only in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, but his claims were also recognized by the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Tyrol, and Bayern-M&uuml;nchen, the Count-Palatine of Simmern, the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, some orders in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and some <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> hitherto adherents of Basle. He was soon embroiled in a quarrel with the Council of Basle concerning his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the distribution of revenues. The rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, and his successor Nicolas V (1447), who were universally recognized from the first in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, found their claims even more widely admitted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1442, Felix left Basle, and on 16 May, 1443, occurred the last session of the Baste assembly. Felix, who had for the sake of its revenue assumed the administration of the Diocese of Geneva, clung for six years more to his usurped dignity but finally submitted (1449) to Nicolas V, received the title of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/13290a.htm">St. Sabina</a>, and was appointed permanent Apostolic <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for all the states of the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and for several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (Basle, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, etc.). Thus ended the last <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.
