<h1>Felix de Andreis</h1>  

<p>First superior of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> (<a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of upper Louisiana, b. at Demonte, in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 13 December, 1778; d. at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, U.S., 15 October, 1820. After making his preparatory studies in his native place he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, at <a href="../cathen/10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a>, 1 November, 1797, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Piacenzia, 14 August, 1801. When only four years a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he conducted the retreats for those about to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. His constitution was not robust and in 1806 he was sent to Monte Citorio, the house of the Congregation in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that seemed least likely to be affected by the rigorous <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> persecutions of the time, which for while drove <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here, Father De Andreis was constantly engaged from 1810 to 1815 in giving missions and retreats for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or seminarians. He also gave many missions in the suburbs of the city. When the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were suppressed, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> students attended his lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. It was no unusual thing for him to preach four times a day on different subjects. In view of later events, it is worthy of reflection that Father De Andreis received such a conviction that he was destined to a mission involving the need of English that he resolutely mastered that language. In 1815 Father Dubourg, Apostolic Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> (which then extended along both sides of the Mississippi from the Gulf of Mexico to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Lakes) arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to secure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for that immense vineyard. As soon as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of Father De Andreis he applied to Father Sicardi, his superior, to let him go to <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and when the latter declared it impossible, as his place could not be filled, he exposed the situation to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, who appointed the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to this mission. In company with five others, Father De Andreis embarked from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 12 June, 1816, and reached Baltimore 26 July. They remained there at St. Mary's Seminary as guests of Father Brut&eacute; until 3 September, and then started on a tedious journey to the west, arriving at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, 19 November, where at Bishop Flaget's suggestion they remained in his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Thomas at Bardstown until Bishop Dubourg should arrive. Father De Andreis taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and laboured at improving his English. Bishop Dubourg reached there with thirty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 29 December, 1817, and they went to St. Louis in 1818. There the Congregation had its first establishment. Father De Andreis had charge of two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, one for religious students, another for seculars, established by Bishop Dubourg. Land for a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was given at "The Barrens", a colony 80 miles south of St. Louis, in Perry County, and when the Bishop allowed his residence to be used for a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, Father De Andreis became master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. Exhausted by the hardships of missionary word, he died after a short life of forty-two years, greatly esteemed for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The process of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, begun in St. Louis in 1900, was completed in August, 1902, when the evidence was presented to the Congregation of Rites, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
