<p>DIOCESE OF FERNS (FERNENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the province of Leinster (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), suffragan of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. It was founded by <a href="../cathen/01170b.htm">St. Aedan</a>, whose name is popularly known as Moaedhog, or "My dear little Aedh", in 598. Subsequently, St. Aedan was given a quasi-supremacy over the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Leinster, with the title of Ard-Escop or chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, on which account he and some of his successors have been regarded as having <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> powers. The old <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> style the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> Fearna-mor Maedhog, that is "the great plain of the alder trees of St. Moedhog. Even yet Moedhog (Mogue) &#151; the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> endearing form of Aedan &#151; is a familiar <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, while it is also perpetuated Tubbermogue, Bovlavogue, Cromogue, Island (<em>Breacc Maedoig</em>) are seen in the National Museum, Dublin. Many of his successors find a place in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>, including St. Mochua, St. Moling and St. Cillene. Of these the most famous is St. Moling, who died 13 May, 697. His book-shrine is among the greatest art treasures of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and his "well" is still visited, but he is best known as patron of St. Mullins (<em>Teach Moling</em>) County Carlow. The ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ferns included a number of cells, or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> style. At present the remains of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (refounded for <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a>, in 1160, by Dermot MaeMurrough) include a round tower, about seventy-five feet high in two stories, the lower of which is quadrangular, and the upper polygonal. Close by is the Holy Well of St. Mogue.

<p>Ferns was raided by the Scandinavians in 834, 836, 839, 842, 917, 920, 928, and 930, and was burned in 937. St. Peter's Church, Ferns, dates from about the year 1060, and is of the Hiberno-Romanesque style, having been built by Bishop O'Lynam, who died in 1062. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were indifferently styled as of Ferns, Hy Kinsellagh, or Wexford; thus, Maeleoin O'Donegan (d. 1125) is called "Bishop of Wexford", while Bishop O'Cathan (d. 1135) is named "Archbishop of Hy Kinsellagh". This was by reason of the fact that the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are coextensive with the territory of Hy Kinsellagh, on which account Ferns includes County Wexford with small portions of Wicklow and Carlow. Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster, burned the city of Ferns in 1166, "for fear that the Connacht men would destroy his castle and his house", and, three years later, he brought over a pioneer force of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welshmen</a>. He died in 1171, and, at his own request, was buried "near the shrines of St. Maedhog and St. Moling". The same year Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> landed in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he remained for six months.

<p>Ailbe O'Molloy, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, who ruled from 1185 to 1222, was the last <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the pre-Reformation history of Ferns. He attended the Fourth General Council of Lateran (1215) and, on his return, formed a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. His successor, Bishop St. John, was granted by Henry III (6 July, 1226) a weekly market at Ferns and an annual fair, also a weekly market at Enniscorthy. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (8 April, 1227) assigned the manor of Enniscorthy to Philip de Prendergast, who built a castle, still in excellent preservation. In exchange, he acquired six plough-lands forever for the See of Ferns. He held a synod at Selskar (St. Sepulchre) Priory, Wexford (8 September, 1240). The appointment of a dean was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> (23 August. 1265). Bishop St. John rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Ferns, which from recent discoveries seems to have been 180 feet in length, with a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. A fine stone <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Aedan, evidently early Norman work, is still preserved. In 1346 the castle of Ferns was made a royal appanage, and constables were appointed by the Crown, but it was recovered by Art MacMurrough in 1386. Patrick Barret, who ruled from 1400 to 1415, removed the episcopal chair of Ferns to New Ross, and made St. Mary's his cathedral. His successor, <a href="../cathen/15615c.htm">Robert Whitty</a>, had an episcopate of forty years, dying in February, 1458. Under John Purcell (1459-1479), <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> acquired a foundation in Enniscorthy, which was dedicated 18 October, 1460. Lawrence Neville (1479-1503) attended a provincial council at Christ Church Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, on 5 March, 1495. His successor, Edmund Comerford, died in 1509, whereupon Nicholas Comyn was elected. Bishop Comyn resided at Fethard Castle, and assisted at the provincial councils of 1512 and 1518. He was transferred to Waterford and Lismore in 1519, and was replaced by John Purcell, whose troubled episcopate ended on 20 July, 1539. Though schismatically consecrated, Alexander Devereux was rehabilitated under <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ferns, and died at Fethard Castle on 6 July, 1566 &#151; the last pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Peter Power was appointed his successor in 1582, but the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were held by John Devereux. Bishop Power died a confessor, in exile, 15 December, 1588. Owing to the disturbed state of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the lack of revenue no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was provided till 19 April, 1624, but meantime Father Daniel O'Drohan, who had to adopt the <em>alias</em> of "James Walshe", acted as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> (1606-1624). John Roche was succeeded by another John Roche, 6 February, 1644, who never entered on possession, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> being administered by William Devereux from 1636 to 1644. Dr. Devereux was an able administrator at a trying period, and he wrote an English <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, which was used in the diocese until a few years ago. <a href="../cathen/06271b.htm">Nicholas French</a> was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ferns 15 September, 1644, and died in exile at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 23 August, 1679. His episcopate was a remarkable one, and he himself was a most distinguished <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Bishop <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> (1678-1691) wrote some charming <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> carols, which are still sung in Wexford. His successors, Michael Rossiter (1695-1709), John Verdon (1709-1729), and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Ambrose O'Callaghan (1729-1744), experienced the full brunt of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>. Nicholas Sweetman (1745-1786) was twice <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on suspicion of "disloyalty", while James Caulfield (1786-1814) was destined to outlive the "rebellion" of '98. One of the Ferns <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Father James Dixon, who was transported as a "felon", was the first <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of Australia. All the post-Reformation <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> lived mostly at Wexford until 1809, in which year Dr. Ryan, coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, commenced the building of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Enniscorthy, which had been assigned him as a mensal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. As Bishop Caulfield was an invalid from the year 1809 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by Dr. Ryan, who, with the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, transferred the episcopal residence to Enniscorthy. Bishop Ryan died 9 March, 1819, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His successor, James Keating (1819-1849), ruled for thirty years, and commenced building the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, designed by <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a>. Myles Murphy (1850-1856) and Thomas Furlong (1857-1875) did much for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, while Michael Warren (1875-1884) is still lovingly remembered.

<p>From an interesting <em>Relatio</em> forwarded to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> by Bishop Caulfield in 1796, the Diocese of Ferns is described as 38 miles in length and 20 in breadth, with eight borough towns, and a chapter of nineteen members. In pre-Reformation days it had 143 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 17 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> friaries; 2 Austin friaries; 1 <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> friary, and 1 <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. It never had a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> nor a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> friary. (The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had a flourishing college in New Ross in 1675.) The population was 120,000, of which 114,000 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and there were 80 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, including regulars. There were 36 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, many of which had no <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>.

<p>At present (1909), the population is 108,750, of which 99,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There are 41 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, two of which (Wexford and Enniscorthy) are mensal. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are 39 and the <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> are 66, while the churches number 92. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders include <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (one house), Augustinians (two houses), and Benedietines (one house). The total <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are 140. In addition, there are 14 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and a House of Missions (Superior Father John Rossiter), as also 6 <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> college, and several good <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> pupils. Enniscorthy <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was not completed until 1875, and the interior not completely finished till 1908. Most Rev. Dr. James Browne was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ferns 14 September, 1884. He was born at Mayglass, County Wexford in 1842, finished his studies at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1865, and served for nineteen years as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with conspicuous ability.
