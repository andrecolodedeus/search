<h1>Feuillants</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> who, about 1145, founded an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in a shady valley in the Diocese of Rieux (now <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>) named it Fuliens, later Les Feuillans or Notre-Dame des Feuillans (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>folium,</em> leaf), and the religious were soon called Feuillants (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Fulienses</em>). Relaxations crept into the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> as into most religious congregations, and in the sixteenth century the Feuillant <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was dishonoured by unworthy <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. A reform was soon to be introduced, however, by Jean de la Barri&#232;re, b. at Saint-C&eacute;r&eacute;, in the <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Diocese of Cahors</a>, 29 April, 1544; d. 25 April, 1600. Having completed a successful course in the humanities at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, at the age of eighteen he was made commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Feuillants by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, succeeding Charles de Crussol, who had just joined the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to continue his studies, and then began his lifelong friendship with the celebrated Arnaud d'Ossat, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In 1573 Barri&#232;re, having resolved to introduce a reform into his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, took the habit of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, and after obtaining the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, made his solemn profession and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, some time after 8 May, 1573. His enterprise was a difficult one. There were twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Les Feuillans who refused to accept the reform, and unmoved by the example and exhortations of their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, resolved to do away with him, by means of poison. Their attempts, however, were frustrated. In 1577, having received the abbatial benediction, he solemnly announced his intention of reforming his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and made the members of the community understand that they had either to accept the reform or leave the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; they chose the latter and dispersed to various <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> houses. Their departure reduced the community to five <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, two professed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, two <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and the superior. The rule was interpreted in its most rigid sense and in many ways even surpassed. Sartorius in his work "Cistercium bis-tertium" sums up the austerities of the reform in these four points: (1) The Feuillants renounced the use of wine, fish, eggs, butter, salt, and all seasoning. Their nourishment consisted of barley bread, herbs cooked in water, and oatmeal. (2) Tables were abolished; they ate on the floor kneeling. (3) They kept the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> habit, but remained bare-headed and barefoot in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. (4) They slept on the ground or on bare planks, with a stone for pillow. They slept but four hours. Silence and manual labour were held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The community was increased rapidly by the admission of fervent <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>.

<p>In 1581 Barri&#232;re received from <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of commendation and in 1589 one of confirmation, establishing the Feuillants as a separate congregation. In spite of the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and general chapters of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, the reform waxed strong. In 1587 <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> called the Feuillants to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he gave them the church of S. Pudentiana, and the same year, Henry III, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, constructed for them the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Bernard, in the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1590, however, the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> brought about dissensions. While Barri&#232;re remained loyal to Henry III, the majority of his religious declared for the League. As a result, in 1592 Barri&#232;re was condemned as a traitor to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, deposed, and reduced to lay communion. It was not until 1600 that, through the efforts of Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, he was exonerated and reinstated. Early in the same year, however, he died in the arms of his friend Cardinal d'Ossat. In 1595 <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> exempted the reform from all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and allowed the Feuillants to draw up new constitutions, containing some mitigations of the primitive rigour. These were approved the same year. In 1598 the Feuillants took possession of a second <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, San Bernardo alle Terme. In 1630 <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> divided the congregation into two entirely distinct branches: that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under the title of Notre-Dame des Feuillants; and that of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, under the name of Bernardoni or Reformed <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a>. In 1634 the Feuillants of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in 1667 the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> modified somewhat the constitutions of 1595. In 1791 at the time of the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, the Feuillants possessed twenty-four <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; almost all the religious were confessors, exiles, or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> eventually combined with the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. The congregation of the Feuillatns has given a number of illustrious personages to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, among others: <a href="../cathen/03645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a>, the celebrated liturgist and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer (d. 1674); Gabriele de Castello (d. 1687), general of the Italian branch, who also received the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat; Dom Charles de Saint-Paul, first general of the Feuillants of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranche, who published in 1641 the "Geographia Sacra"; among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>, Pierre Comag&#232;re (d. 1662), Laurent Apisius (d. 1681), and Jean Goulu (d. 1629). Special mention should be made of Carlo Giuseppe Morozzi (Morotius), author of the most important history of the order, the "Cistercii reflores centis &hellip; chronologica historia". Many <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> give Jean de la Berri&#232;re (25 April) the title of Venerable. The Abbey des Feuillants was authorized by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> to publicly venerate his remains, but the cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> has never been introduced.

<p>The F<font size=-2>EUILLANTINES, </font> founded in 1588 by Jean de la Barri&#232;re, embraced the same rule and adopted the same austerities as the Feuillants. Matrons of the highest distinction sought admission into this severe order, which soon grew in numbers, but during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, in 1791, the Feuillantines disappeared.
