<h1>Fideism</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>fides</em>, faith).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> term meaning a system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or an attitude of mind, which, denying the power of unaided <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to reach certitude, affirms that the fundamental act of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> consists in an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the supreme criterion of certitude is authority.

<p>Fideism has divers degrees and takes divers forms, according to the field of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to which it is extended, and the various elements which are affirmed as constituting the authority. For some fideists, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot of itself reach certitude in regard to any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whatever; for others, it cannot reach certitude in regard to the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, morality, and religion, while some maintain that we can give a firm <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> assent to revelation on motives of credibility that are merely probable. Authority, which according to fideism is the rule of certitude, has its ultimate foundation in divine revelation, reserved and transmitted in all ages through <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and manifested by tradition, common sense or some other agent of a social character. Fideism was maintained by Huet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches, in his work "De imbecillitate mentis humanae" (Amsterdam, 1748); by de Bonald, who laid great stress on tradition in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as the means of the transmission of revelation and the criterion of certitude; by <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, who assigns as a rule of certitude the general reason (la raison g&eacute;n&eacute;rale) or common consent of the race (D&eacute;fense de l'essai sur l'indiff&eacute;rence, chs. viii, xi); by <a href="../cathen/02677a.htm">Bonnetty</a> in "Annales de philosophie chr&eacute;tienne"; by <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Bautain</a>, Ventura, <a href="../cathen/15114a.htm">Ubaghs</a>, and others at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. These are sometimes called moderate fideists, for, though they maintained that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, they admitted that, after accepting the teaching of revelation concerning them, human intelligence can demonstrate the reasonableness of such a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. (cf. <a href="../cathen/15114a.htm">Ubaghs</a>, Logicae seu Philosophiae rationalis elementa, Louvain, 1860).

<p>In addition to these systematic formulae of fideism, we find throughout the history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> from the time of the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophists</a> to the present day a fideistic attitude of mind, which became more or less conspicuous at different periods. Fideism owes its origin to distrust in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> sequence of such an attitude is scepticism. It is to escape from this conclusion that some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, accepting as a principle the impotency of reason, have emphasized the need of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, either asserting the primacy of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> over reason or else affirming a radical separation between reason and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, that is, between <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and philosophy on the one hand and religion on the other. Such is the position taken by <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, when he distinguishes between pure reason, confined to subjectivity, and practical reason, which alone is able to put us by an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in relation with objective reality. It is also a fideistic attitude which is the occasion of <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a>, of positivism, of pragmatism and other modern forms of anti-intellectualism. As against these views, it must be noted that authority, even the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be the supreme criterion of certitude, and an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be the primary form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. This authority, indeed, in order to be a motive of assent, must be previously acknowledged as being certainly valid; before we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a proposition as revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with certitude that <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a>, that He reveals such and such a proposition, and that His teaching is worthy of assent, all of which questions can and must be ultimately decided only by an act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> assent based on objective evidence. Thus, fideism not only denies <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> ruins <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself.

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has condemned such doctrines. In 1348, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> proscribed certain fideistic propositions of Nicholas d'Autrecourt (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, 10th ed., nn. 553-570). In his two Encyclicals, one of September, 1832, and the other of July, 1834, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> condemned the political and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Lamenais. On 8 September, 1840, <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Bautain</a> was required to subscribe to several propositions directly opposed to Fideism, the first and the fifth of which read as follows: "Human reason is able to prove with certitude the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a heavenly gift, is posterior to revelation, and therefore cannot be properly used against the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist</a> to prove the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>"; and "The use of reason precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and, with the help of revelation and grace, leads to it." The same proposition were subscribed to by <a href="../cathen/02677a.htm">Bonnetty</a> on 11 June, 1855 (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, nn. 1650-1652). In his Letter of 11 December, 1862, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, while condemning Frohschammer's <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>, affirms the ability of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to reach certitude concerning the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 1666-1676). And, finally, the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> teaches as a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that "one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God and Lord</a> can be known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> by the natural light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> by means of the things that are made" (Const., De Fide Catholic&acirc;", Sess. III, can. i, De Revelatione; cf. <a href="../cathen/06725a.htm">Granderath</a>, "Constitutiones dogmaticae Conc. Vatic.", Freiburg, 1892, p. 32 cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 1806).

<p>As to the opinion of those who maintain that our <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> assent is prepared for by motives of credibility merely probable, it is evident that it <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> destroys the certitude of such an assent. This opinion was condemned by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 2 March, 1679 (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 1171), and by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili sane" n. 25: "Assensus fidei ultimo innititur in congerie probabilitatum" (The assent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is ultimately based on a sum of probabilities). Revelation, indeed, is the supreme motive of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, yet, the existence of this motive and its validity has to be established by reason. No one will deny the importance of authority and tradition or common consent in human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. It is quite evident that to despise the teaching of the sages, the scientific discoveries of the past, and the voice of common consent would be to condemn ourselves to a perpetual infancy in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to render impossible any progress in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, to ignore the social character of man, and to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> intolerable: but, on the other hand, it is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to make these elements the supreme criteria of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since they are only particular rules of certitude, the validity of which is grounded upon a more fundamental rule. It is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that moral certitude differs from mathematical, but the difference lies not in the firmness or validity of the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> afforded, but in the process employed and the dispositions required by the nature of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> with which they respectively deal. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on this question is in accord with history and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Rejecting both <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> and fideism, it teaches that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is capable (physical ability) of knowing the moral and religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the natural order; that it can prove with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and can acknowledge most certainly the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that, however, in the present conditions of life, it needs (of moral necessity) the help of revelation to acquire a sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all the natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to direct <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of natural religion (Conc. Vatic., "De Fide Cath.", cap. ii; cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Cont. Gent.", Lib. I, c, iv).
