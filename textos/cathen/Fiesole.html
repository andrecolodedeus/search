<h1>Fiesole</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF FIESOLE (F&AElig;SULANA).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, suffragan of Florence. The town is of Etruscan origin, as may be seen from the remains of its ancient walls. In <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity it was the seat of a famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of augurs, and every year twelve young men were sent thither from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study the art of divination. Sulla colonized it with veterans, who afterwards, under the leadership of Manlius, supported the cause of Catiline. Near Fiesole the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> and Suevi under Radagaisus were defeated (405) by hunger rather than by the troops of Stilicho. During the Gothic War (536-53) the town was several times besieged. In 539 Justinus, the Byzantine general, captured it and razed its fortifications. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Fiesole was more powerful than Florence in the valley below, and many <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> arose between them. In 1010 and 1025 Fiesole was sacked by the Florentines, and its leading <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take up their residence in Florence.

<p>According to local legend the Gospel was first preached at Fiesole by St. Romulus, a disciple of St. Peter. The fact that the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (now the Abbazia Fiesolana) stands outside the city is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> origins of Fiesole date from the period of the persecutions. The earliest mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fiesole is in a letter of Gelasius I (492-496). A little later, under Vigilius (537-55), a Bishop Rusticus is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> at one of the Councils of Constantinople. The legendary St. Alexander is said by some to belong to the time of the Lombard King Autari (end of the sixth century), but the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> assign him to the reign of Lothair (middle of the ninth century). A very famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is St. Donatus, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the friend and adviser of Emperors Louis the Pious and Lothair. He was elected in 826 and is buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where his epitaph, dictated by himself, may still be seen. He founded the abbey of San Martino di Mensola; Bishop Zanobi in 890 founded that of St. Michael at Passignano, which was afterwards given to the Vallombrosan <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Hildebrand of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> (1220), exiled by the Florentines; <a href="../cathen/01472d.htm">St. Andrew Corsini</a> (1352), born in 1302 of a noble Florentine <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and who, after a reckless youth, became a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was renowned as a peacemaker between <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and States. He died 6 January, 1373, and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. Other famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fra Jacopo Altovita (1390), noted for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; Antonio Aglio (1466), a learned <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> and author of a collection of lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; the Augustinian Guglielmo Bachio (1470), a celebrated preacher, and author of commentaries on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and on the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>; Francesco Cataneo Diaceto (1570), a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and a prolific writer; Lorenzo della Robbia (1634), who built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Among the glories of Fiesole should be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Lorenzo Monaco (1370-1424). But the greatest name associated with the history of the city is that of Blessed Giovanni Angelico, called da Fiesole (1387-1455). His <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> was Guido, but, entering the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Fiesole, he took the name of Giovanni in religion; that of Angelico was afterwards given to him in allusion to the beauty and purity of his works.

<p>The Cathedral of St. Romulus was built in 1028 by Bishop Jacopo Bavaro with materials taken from several older edifices; it contains notable <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by <a href="../cathen/16063c.htm">Mino da Fiesole</a>. The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> passed into the hands of the regular canons of Lateran. It once possessed a valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, long since dispersed. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was closed in 1778. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 254 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 155,800 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Within its limits there are 12 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men, including the famous Vallombrosa, and 24 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>The principal holy places of Fiesole are: (1) the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (<em>Il Duomo</em>), containing the shrine of St. Romulus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, according to legend the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fiesole, and that of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> companions, also the shrine of St. Donatus of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; (2) the Badia or ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at the foot of the hill on which Fiesole stands, supposed to cover the site of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Romulus; (3) the room in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace where <a href="../cathen/01472d.htm">St. Andrew Corsini</a> lived and died; (4) the little church of the Primerana in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> square, where the same saint was warned by Our Lady of his approaching death; (5) the church of S. Alessandro, with the shrine of St. Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; (6) the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Francesco on the crest of the hill, with the cells of <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a> and seven <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Beati; (7) S. Girolamo, the home of Venerable Carlo dei Conti Guidi, founder of the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymites</a> of Fiesole (1360); (8) S. Domenico, the novice-home of <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico da Fiesole</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of Florence; (9) Fontanelle, a villa near S. Domenico where St. Aloysius came to live in the hot summer months, when a page at the court of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici; (10) Fonte Lucente, where a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> crucifix is greatly revered. A few miles distant is (11) Monte Senario, the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Order, where its seven holy founders lived in great austerity and were cheered at their death by the songs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; also (12) S. Martino di Mensola, with the body of St. Andrew, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> saint, still incorrupt.
