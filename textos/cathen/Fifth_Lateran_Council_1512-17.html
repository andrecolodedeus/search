<h1>Fifth Lateran Council (1512-17)</h1>  

<p>When elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> promised under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he would soon convoke a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. Time passed, however, and this promise was not fulfilled. Consequently, certain dissatisfied <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, urged, also, by Emperor Maximilian and Louis XII, convoked a council at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and fixed 1 September, 1511, for its opening This event was delayed until 1 October. Four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> then met at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> provided with proxies from three absent <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were also there, as well as ambassadors from the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Seven or eight sessions were held, in the last of which <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> was suspended, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> withdrew to Lyons. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> hastened to oppose to this <em>conciliabulum</em> a more numerously attended council, which he convoked, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 18 July, 1511, to assemble 19 April, 1512, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Lateran. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was at once a canonical and a polemical document. In it the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refuted in detail the reasons alleged by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> for their <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> <em>conciliabulum</em>. He declared that his conduct before his elevation to the pontificate was a pledge of his sincere desire for the celebration of the council; that since his elevation he had always sought opportunities for assembling it; that for this reason he had sought to reestablish peace among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes; that the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which had arisen against his will had no other object than the reestablishment of pontifical authority in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. He then reproached the rebel <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> with the irregularity of their conduct and the unseemliness of convoking the Universal Church independently of its head. He pointed out to them that the three months accorded by them for the assembly of all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> was too short, and that said city presented none of the advantages requisite for an assembly of such importance. Finally, he declared that no one should attach any significance to the act of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was signed by twenty-one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The French victory of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (11 April, 1512) hindered the opening of the council before 3 May, on which day the fathers met in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>. There were present fifteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the Latin Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch, ten <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, fifty-six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, some <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and generals of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, the ambassadors of Kings Ferdinand, and those of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and of Florence. Convoked by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, the assembly survived him, was continued by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and held its twelfth, and last, session on 16 March, 1417. In the third session Matthew Lang, who had represented Maximilian at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, read an act by which that emperor repudiated all that had been done at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. In the fourth session the advocate of the council demanded the revocation of the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. In the eighth (17 December, 1513), an act of King Louis XII was read, disavowing the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> and adhering to the Lateran Council. In the next session (5 March, 1514) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> published four decrees: <ul> <li>the first of these sanctions the institution of <em>ontes pietatis</em>, or pawn shops, under strict <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supervision, for the purpose of aiding the necessitous poor on the most favourable terms; <li>the second relates to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberty and the episcopal dignity, and condemns certain abusive exemptions; <li>the third forbids, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, the printing of books without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <li>the fourth orders a peremptory citation against the French in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>. The latter was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> revoked and condemned, and the concordat with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> approved, in the eleventh session (19 December, 1516). <li>Finally, the council <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> prescribing <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and ordered the levying of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> for three years. </ul>
