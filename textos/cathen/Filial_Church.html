<h1>Filial Church</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>filialis</em>, from <em>filia</em>, daughter), a church to which is annexed the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, but which remains dependent on another church. As this dependence on the mother church may be of various degrees, the term <em>filial church</em> may have naturally more than one signification as to minor details. Ordinarily, a filial church is a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church which has been constituted by the dismemberment of an older <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> is really a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, having all the essential <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of such a dignity, but still bound to defer in certain accidental matters to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the mother church. The marks of deference required are not so fixed that local custom may not change them. Such marks are: obtaining the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water from the mother church, making a moderate offering of money (fixed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the mother church annually, and occasionally during the year assisting with his parishioners in a body at services in the older church. In some places this last includes a procession and the presentation of a wax candle. If the filial church has been endowed from the revenues of the mother church, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the latter has the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> when a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> for the dependent church is to be appointed.

<p>This term is also applied to churches established within the limits of an extensive <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, without any dismemberment of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> territory. The Pastor of such a filial church is really only a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> or assistant of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the mother church, and he is removable at will, except in cases where he has a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may retain to himself the right of performing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, assisting at marriages and similar offices in the filial church, or he may ordain that such functions be performed only in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, restricting the services in the filial church to Mass and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. In practice, however, the <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> of such filial churches act as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for their districts, although by canon law the dependence upon the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the mother church remains of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, though all outward manifestation of subjection has ceased.

<p>In the union of two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the manner called "union by subjection", the less important of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches may sink into a condition scarcely distinguishable from that of a filial church and be comprehended under this term. In other words, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may govern such a church by giving it over to one of his assistants. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the subjected church does not lose its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, yet its dependence on the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of another church and its administration by a vicar has led to its being included loosely under the designation filial church. Historically, this term has also been applied to those churches, often in different countries, founded by other and greater churches. In this sense the great patriarchical Sees of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Constantinople established many filial churches which retained a special dependence upon the church founding them. The term Mother Church, however, as applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, has a special significance as indicating its headship of all churches.
