<h1>Filioque</h1>  

<p>Filioque is a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> formula of great <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> and historical importance. On the one hand, it expresses the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from both Father and Son as one Principle; on the other, it was the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>. Both aspects of the expression need further explanation.
<h2 id="section1">Dogmatic meaning of <em>filioque</em></h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from Father and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as one Principle is directly opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the Father, not from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Neither <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> nor <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> created much difficulty during the course of the first four centuries. Macedonius and his followers, the so-called <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachi</a>, were condemned by the local <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a> (362) and by <a href="../cathen/04613a.htm">Pope St. Damasus</a> (378) for teaching that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> derives His origin from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> alone, by <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> used by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, which was composed probably by <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and the expressions of <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a> directed against the ninth <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> by <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, deny that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> derives His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from or through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they probably intend to deny only the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by or through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, inculcating at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> His Procession from both Father and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. At any rate, if the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was discussed at all in those earlier times, the controversy was restricted to the East and was of short duration.

<p>The first undoubted denial of the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> we find in the seventh century among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> when <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">St. Martin I</a> (649-655), in his synodal writing against the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, employed the expression "Filioque". Nothing is known about the further development of this controversy; it does not seem to have assumed any serious proportions, as the question was not connected with the characteristic teaching of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>.

<p>In the Western church the first controversy concerning the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was conducted with the envoys of the Emperor Constantine Copronymus, in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of Gentilly near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, held in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/11662b.htm">Pepin</a> (767). The synodal Acts and other information do not seem to exist. At the beginning of nineth century, John, a Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Sabas, charged the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Mt. Olivet with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, they had inserted the Filioque into the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>. In the second half the same century, <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> <a href="../cathen/07647a.htm">Ignatius</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> (858), denied the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and opposed the insertion of the Filioque into the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Constantinopolitan creed</a>. The same position was maintained towards the end of the tenth century by the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarchs</a> Sisinnius and Sergius, and about the middle of the eleventh century by the <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Patriarch Michael Caerularius</a>, who renewed and completed the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>.

<p>The rejection of the Filioque, or the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the Father and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the denial of the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> constitute even today the principal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek church</a>. While outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> grew into open denial, inside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Filioque was declared to be a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215), the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second council of Lyons</a> (1274), and the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1438-1445). Thus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proposed in a clear and authoritative form the teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> on the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Third Person of the Holy Trinity</a>.

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Sacred Scripture</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> writers call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">Spirit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs6">Galatians 4:6</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs19">Philippians 1:19</a>), just as they call Him the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">Spirit</a> of the Father (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs20">Matthew 10:20</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>). Hence they attribute to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the same relation to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as to the Father.

<p>Again, according to <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> sends the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs49">Luke 24:49</a>; <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs26">John 15:26</a>; <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs7">16:7</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">20:22</a>; <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs33">Acts 2:33</a>; <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs6">Titus 3:6</a>), just as the Father sends the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> (<a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs3">Romans 3:3</a>; etc.), and as the Father sends the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs26">John 14:26</a>).

<p>Now the "mission" or "sending" of one Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> by another does not mean merely that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> said to be sent assumes a particular character, at the suggestion of Himself in the character of Sender, as the Sabellians maintained; nor does it imply any inferiority in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> sent, as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> taught; but it denotes, according to the teaching of the weightier <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and Fathers, the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> sent from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> Who sends. <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> never presents the Father as being sent by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as being sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the term "mission" implies that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sent goes forth for a certain purpose by the power of the sender, a power exerted on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> sent by way of a physical impulse, or of a command, or of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or finally of production; now, Procession, the <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> of production, is the only manner admissible in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It follows that the inspired writers present the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since they present Him as sent by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p>Finally, <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs13">St. John (16:13-15)</a> gives the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "What things soever he [the Spirit] shall hear, he shall speak; ...he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you. All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine." Here a double consideration is in place. First, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> has all things that the Father hath, so that He must resemble the Father in being the Principle from which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds. Secondly, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall receive "of mine" according to the words of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; but Procession is the only conceivable way of receiving which does not imply dependence or inferiority. In other words, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.

<p>The teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> on the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was faithfully preserved in <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a>. Even the Greek Orthodox grant that the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> maintain the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">Procession</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The great work on the Trinity by <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> (Lib. VII, cc. iii sqq.) develops the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this contention at length.

The ambiguous expressions found in some of the early writers of authority are explained by the principles which apply to the language of the early Fathers generally.
<h2 id="section2">Historical importance of the <em>filioque</em></h2>

<p>It has been seen that the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed of Constantinople</a> at first declared only the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the Father; it was directed against the followers of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonius</a> who denied the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the Father. In the East, the omission of Filioque did not lead to any misunderstanding. But <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> were different in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> after the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> had renounced <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Third <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of Toledo, 589. It cannot be acertained who first added the Filioque to the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed</a>; but it appears to be <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed</a>, with the addition of the Filioque, was first sung in the Spanish <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. In 796 the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> justified and adopted the same addition at the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of Friaul, and in 809 the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> appears to have approved of it.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of this last council were examined by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a>, who approved of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> conveyed by the Filioque, but gave the advice to omit the expression in the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed</a>. The practice of adding the Filioque was retained in spite of the papal advice, and in the middle of the eleventh century it had gained a firm foothold in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself. Scholars do not agree as to the exact <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of its introduction into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but most assign it to the reign of <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a> (1014-15).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> was accepted by the Greek deputies who were present at the Second Council of Florence, in 1439, when the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed</a> was sung both in Greek and Latin, with the addition of the word <em>Filioque</em>. On each occasion it was <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hoped</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> and his subjects had abandoned the state of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in which they had been living since the time of <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, who about 870 found in the Filioque an excuse for throwing off all dependence on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But however sincere the individual Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may have been, they failed to carry their people with them, and the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">breach between East and West</a> continues to this day.

<p>It is a matter for surprise that so abstract a subject as the doctrine of the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should have appealed to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the multitude. But their national feelings had been aroused by the desire of liberation from the rule of the ancient rival of Constantinople; the occasion of lawfully obtaining their desire appeared to present itself in the addition of Filioque to the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed</a> of Constantinople. Had not <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> overstepped her <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by disobeying the injunction of the Third Council, of Ephesus (431), and of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Fourth, of Chalcedon</a> (451)?

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that these councils had forbidden to introduce another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or another <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, and had imposed the penalty of <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> for transgressing this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; but the councils had not forbidden to explain the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or to propose the same <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> in a clearer way. Besides, the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> affected <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> transgressors, as is plain from the <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> added; they did not bind the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a body. Finally, the Councils of Lyons and Florence did not require the Greeks to insert the Filioque into the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Creed</a>, but only to accept the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the double Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.
