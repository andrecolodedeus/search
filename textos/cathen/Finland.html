<p>GRAND DUCHY OF FINLAND.

<p>A department or province of the <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russian Empire</a>; bounded on the north by <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, on the west by <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and the Gulf of Bothnia, on the south by the Gulf of Finland. Its limits extend from about 60&#176; to 70&#176; N. lat., and from about 19&#176; to 33&#176; E. long.; the area is 141,617 sq. miles. Finland abounds in lakes and forests, buit the proportion of arable soil is small. The population numbers 2,900,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, chiefly Finns; the coasts are inhabited by the descendants of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> settlers.

<p>Up to the beginning of the twelfth century the people were <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, about this date efforts for the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the Finns were made from two sides. The Grand Duke of Novgorod, Vassievolodovich, sent <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russian</a> missionaries to the Karelians, Finns living on the Lake of Ladoga in east Finland, while in 1157 King Erik of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> undertook a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to Finland. Erik established himself firmly on the south-western coast and from this base extended his power. Henrik, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, who had accompanied Erik on this expedition, devoted himself to preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and suffered the death of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in 1158. His <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a>, Rodulfus, met the same fate about 1178, while the next following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Folkvin, died a natural death.

<p>Finland attained an independent church organization under Bishop Thomas (1220; d. 1248), whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was R&#228;ntem&#228;kai; at a later date the <a href="../cathen/12785b.htm">episcopal residence</a> was transferred to &#197;bo. The <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> of Thomas were: Bero I (d. 1258); Ragvald I (1258-66); Kettil (1266-86); Joannes I (1286-90); Magnus I (1290-1308), who was the first Finn to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to &#197;bo; Ragvald II (1309-21); Bengt (1321-38); Hemming (1338-66), who made wise <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, built numerous <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, began the collection of a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; in 1514 his bones were taken up, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> now being in the museum of the city of &#197;bo, but he was not <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>; Henricus Hartmanni (1366-68); Joannes II Petri (1368-70); Joannes III Westfal (1370-85), a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of German descent; Bero II (1385-1412); Magnus II Olai Tavast (1412-50), the most important prince of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Finland, who, when eighty-eight years old, undertook arduous <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">visitations</a>; he also went on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08364a.htm">Holy Land</a> whence he brought back objects of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; Olaus Magni (1450-60), who in earlier years was twice <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Sorbonne, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and was also <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> and bursar of the "English nation" at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. As representative of these he settled the disagreement between Charles VII and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> arising from the part the latter had taken in the burning of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; Conrad I Bitz (1460-89), who in 1488 had the "Missale ecclesi&aelig; &#197;boensis" printed; Magnus III Stjernkors (1489-1500); Laurentius Suurp&#228;&#228; (1500-06); Joannes IV Olavi (1506-10); Arvid Kurck (1510-20), who was drowned in the Baltic; Ericus Svenonis (1523), the chancellor of King Gustavus Vasa; this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> as his <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">election</a> was not confirmed by <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Rome</a>. He was the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Finland. The king now, on his own <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">authority</a>, appointed his favourite, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Martin Skytte, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; Skytte did all in his power to promote the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> introduction of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. The people were deceived by the retention of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were given the choice of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, expulsion, or <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The only moderation shown was that exhibited towards the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Nidendal. But on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at &#197;bo and <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at K&ouml;kars were rudely driven out and apparently the inmates of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Raumo were hung. Then, as later, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Finland did not lack <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, among them being J&ouml;ns Jussoila, Peter Ericius, and others.

<p>By the end of the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Finland may be said to have ceased to exist. In its place appeared an inflexible and inquisitorial <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. When in 1617 Karelia (East Finland) fell to <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, an effort was made to win the native population, which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Greek Orthodox Church</a>, for the "pure <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>". As this did not succeed, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1566-68 was used for the massacre and expulsion of the people. In consequence of the victories of Peter the Great matters after a while took another course; in 1809 <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> became the ruler of Finland and the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek Church</a> has of late grown in strength. It numbers now 50,000 members under an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; it has fine <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church buildings</a>, especially in Helsingfors, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (Valaam and Konevetz), a church paper published at <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a>, and numerous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russian</a> sovereignty the long repressed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> received again (1869 and 1889) the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exist, but it is still very weak, and numbers only about 1000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; there are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> at &#197;bo and Helsingfors. The great majority of the inhabitants belong now, as before, to the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The State Church of former times, now the "National" Church, to which the larger part of the population adhere, is divided into four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: &#197;bo, Kuopio, Borg&#229;, and Nyslott; these contain altogether 45 provostships and 512 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The finest of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church buildings</a> are the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">domed</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas at Helsingfors and the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> at &#197;bo, formerly the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Education</a> is provided for by a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and technical high school at Helsingfors, by lyceums of the rank of gymnasia, modern scientific <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Finland has a rich literature both in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> and Finnish. Besides the followers of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there are both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> in Finland, but they have no civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Since the middle of the nineteenth century about 200,000 Finns have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, settling largely in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a> and <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>. The town of Hancock, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, is the centre of their <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work.
