<h1>Firmicus Maternus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> author of the fourth century; wrote a work "De errore profanarum religionum". Nothing is known about him except what can be gleaned from this work, which is found in only one <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Codex Vaticano-Palatinus, Saec. X). Some references to the Persian Wars, and the fact that the work was addressed to the two emperors, Constantius II and Constans I, have led to the conclusion that it was composed during their joint reign (337-350). The work is valuable because it gives a picture of the character which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> of the later Roman Empire had taken, under the stress of the new spiritual needs aroused by contact with the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the East. It aims, if one may judge from the mutilated introduction, at presenting from a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and historical standpoint, reasons showing the superiority of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> over the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> and licentiousness of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. In a general survey of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> creeds and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> the author holds up to scorn the origin and practices of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> cults. All its parts are not of equal merit or importance, from the purely historical standpoint. The first portion, in which the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of Greece and the East are described, is merely a compilation from earlier sources, but in the latter section of the work, in which the mysteries of Eleusis, Isis, and especially <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a> are set forth in detail, with their system of curious passwords, formulae, and ceremonies, the author seems to speak from personal experience, and thus reveals many interesting facts which are not found elsewhere. The emperors are exhorted to stamp out this network of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and immorality, as a sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for which they will receive a reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and ultimately the praise and thanks of those whom they rescue from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and corruption. The theory that the author of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> work was identical with Julius Firmicus Maternus Siculus, who wrote a work on <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> (De Nativitatibus sive Matheseos), assigned by Mommsen to the year 337 ["Hermes", XXIX (1894), 468 sq.], is favourably received by some, as well because of the identity of names and dates, as because of similarities in style which they are satisfied the two documents exhibit. This theory of course supposes that the author wrote one work before, the other after, his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. Critical edition by Halm (Vienna, 1867) in "Corpus Scrip. Eccles. Lat.", II.
