<h1>First Council of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>(SECOND GENERAL COUNCIL.)

<p>This council was called in May, 381, by <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>, to provide for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> succession in the patriarchal See of Constantinople, to confirm the Nicene Faith, to reconcile the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">semi-Arians</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to put an end to the Macedonian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>Originally it was only a council of the Orient; the arguments of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> (ad an. 381, nos. 19, 20) to prove that it was called by Pope Damasus are invalid (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, Hist. des Conciles, Paris, 1908, II, 4). It was attended by 150 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and 36 <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> (<a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a>, Macedonian) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and was presided over by <a href="../cathen/10161b.htm">Meletius of Antioch</a>; after his death, by the successive Patriarchs of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> and Nectarius.

<p>Its first measure was to confirm <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople. The Acts of the council have almost entirely disappeared, and its proceedings are known chiefly through the accounts of the ecclesiastical historians <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, and Theodoret. There is good reason to believe that it drew up a formal treatise (<em>tomos</em>) on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the Trinity, also against <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a>; this important document has been lost, with the exception of the first canon of the council and its famous <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">creed (Nic&aelig;ano-Constantinopolitanum)</a>. The latter is traditionally held to be an enlargement of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, with emphasis on the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. It seems, however, to be of earlier origin, and was probably composed (369-73) by <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> as an expression of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of that Church (Bois), though its adoption by this council gave it special authority, both as a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> creed and as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> formula. Recently Harnack (Realencyklopadie fur prot. Theol. und Kirche, 3rd ed., XI, 12-28) has maintained, on apparently inconclusive grounds, that not till after the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) was this creed (a <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> formula with Nicene additions) attributed to the Fathers of this council. At Chalcedon, indeed, it was twice recited and appears twice in the Acts of that council; it was also read and accepted at the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a>, held at Constantinople in 680. The very ancient Latin version of its text (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., III, 567) is by <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>.

<p>The Greeks recognize seven <a href="../fathers/3809.htm">canons</a>, but the oldest Latin versions have only four; the other three are very probably (Hefele) later additions. <ul> <li>The first canon is an important dogmatic condemnation of all shades of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, also of Macedonianism and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a>. <li>The second canon renews the Nicene legislation imposing upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the observance of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and patriarchal limits. <li>The fourth canon declares invalid the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Maximus, the Cynic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and rival of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople. <li>The famous third canon declares that because Constantinople is New Rome the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city should have a pre-eminence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> wrongly maintained the non-authenticity of this canon, while some <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Greeks maintained (an equally <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> thesis) that it declared the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the royal city in all things the equal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The purely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> of Rome's ancient authority, suggested by this canon, was never admitted by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which always based its claim to supremacy on the succession of St. Peter. Nor did <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> easily acknowledge this unjustifiable reordering of rank among the ancient <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> of the East. It was rejected by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> at Chalcedon. <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a> (Ep. cvi in P.L., LIV, 1003, 1005) declared that this canon has never been submitted to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and that it was a violation of the Nicene order. At the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a> in 869 the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XVI, 174) acknowledged Constantinople as second in patriarchal rank. In 1215, at the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (op. cit., XXII, 991), this was formally admitted for the new Latin patriarch, and in 1439, at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, for the Greek patriarch (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, Hist. des Conciles, II, 25-27). The Roman <em>correctores</em> of Gratian (1582), at dist. xxii, c. 3, insert the words: "canon hic ex iis est quos apostolica Romana sedes a principio et longo post tempore non recipit." </ul> At the close of this council <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> issued an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (30 July) declaring that the churches should be restored to those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who confessed the equal Divinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and who held communion with Nectarius of Constantinople and other important Oriental <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> whom he named. The ecumenical character of this council seems to date, among the Greeks, from the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451). According to Photius (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, III, 596) Pope Damasus approved it, but if any part of the council were approved by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> it could have been only the aforesaid creed. In the latter half of the fifth century the successors of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> are silent as to this council. Its mention in the so-called "Decretum Gelasii", towards the end of the fifth century, is not original but a later insertion in that text (Hefele). <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, following the example of Vigilius and <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>, recognized it as one of the four <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, but only in its dogmatic utterances (P.G., LXXVII, 468, 893).
