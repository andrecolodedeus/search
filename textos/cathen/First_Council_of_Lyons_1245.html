<h1>First Council of Lyons (1245)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, threatened by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, arrived at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> 2 December, 1244, and early in 1245 summoned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes to the council. The chronicle of St. Peter of Erfurt states that two hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> responded; the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> Mencon speaks of three <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, three hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and numerous <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The Abb&eacute; Martin without deciding between these figures has succeeded in recovering to a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the names of one hundred assistants, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or lords, of whom thirty-eight were from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, thirty from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, eleven from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> or the countries of the North, eight from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, five from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, five from the Latin Orient. Baldwin II, Latin Emperor of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Raymond B&eacute;renger IV, Count of Provence, Albert Rezats, Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Berthold, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, Nicholas, Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, came to the council, which opened 28 June at St-Jean. After the "Veni Creator" and the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> preached his famous sermon on the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">five wounds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the text "Secundum multitudinem dolorum meorum in corde meo, consolationes tuae laetificaverunt animam meam". He enumerated his five sorrows: (1) the bad conduct of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and faithful; (2) the insolence of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; (3) the Greek Schism; (4) the cruelties of the Tatars in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; (5) the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Emperor Frederick; and he caused to be read the privilege granted to Pope Honorious III by Frederick when the latter was as yet only King of the Romans. Thaddeus of Suessa, Frederick's ambassador, arose, attempted to make excuses for the emperor, and cited numerous plots against the emperor which, he said, had been instigated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On 29 June at the request of the procurators of the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> granted Thaddeus a delay of ten days for the arrival of the emperor.

<p>At the second session (July 5) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Calvi and a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> attacked the emperor's manner of life and his plots against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; again Thaddeus spoke on his behalf and asked a delay for his arrival. Despite the advice of numerous <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent</a> (9 July) decided to postpone the third session until the seventeenth. On the seventeenth Frederick had not come. Baldwin II, <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, and Berthold, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, interceded in vain for him; Thaddeus in his master's name appealed to a future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and a more general council; <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent</a> pronounced the deposition of Frederick, caused it to be signed by one hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and charged the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> with its publication everywhere. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> lacked the material means to execute this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>; the Count of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> refused to allow an army sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the emperor to pass through his territory, and for a time it was feared that Frederick would attack <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The Council of Lyons took several other purely religious measures; it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, approved the Rule of the Order of Grandmont, decided the institution of the octave of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, prescribed that henceforth <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should wear a red hat, and lastly prepared thirty-eight constitutions which were later inserted by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, the most important of which, received with protests by the envoys of the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, decreed a levy of a twentieth on every <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> for three years for the relief of the Holy Land (Constitution "Afflicti corde") and a levy for the benefit of the Latin Empire of Constantinople of half the revenue of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> whose titulars did not reside therein for at least six months of the year (Constitution "Arduis mens occupata negotiis").
