<h1>Flabellum</h1>  

<p>The flabellum, in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use, is a fan made of leather, silk, parchment, or feathers intended to keep away insects from the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacred Species</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It was in use in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> from very early days, for in the Apostolic Constitutions, a work of the fourth century, we read (VIII, 12): "Let two of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, on each side of the altar, hold a fan, made up of thin membranes, or of the feathers of the peacock, or of fine cloth, and let them silently drive away the small animals that fly about, that they may not come near to the cups". Its use was continued in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> to about the fourteenth century. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> to the present day, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, at his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, receives the <em>hagion ripidion</em>, or sacred fan, which is generally made to the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherub's</a> six-winged face, and in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a> he waves it gently over the species from the time of the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> to the Communion &mdash; in the Liturgy of St. Basil only during the Consecration. Among the ornaments found belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Riquier, in Ponthieu (813), there is a silver flabellum (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CLXXIV, 1257), and for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Cisoin, near Lisle, another flabellum of silver is noted in the will of Everard (died 937), the founder of that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. When, in 1777, Mart&egrave;ne wrote his "Voyage Litt&eacute;raire", the Abbey of Tournus, on the Sa&ocirc;ne in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, possessed an old flabellum, which had an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> handle two feet long, and was beautifully carved; the two sides of the <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> circular disc were engraved with fourteen figures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Pieces of this fan, dating from the eighth century, are in the Mus&eacute;e Cluny at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and in the Collection Carrand. The circular disc is also found in the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> flabellum of the thirteenth century, preserved at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and in the one shown in the Megaspileon <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>. On this latter disc are carved the Madonna and Child and it is encircled by eight medallions containing the images of <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and of the Four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. The inventory, taken in 1222, of the treasury of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, enumerates a silver fan and two of parchment. The richest and most beautiful specimen is the flabellum of the thirteenth century in the Abbey of Kremsm&uuml;nster in Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. It has the shape of a Greek cross and is ornamented with fretwork and the representation of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Our Lord</a>. A kind of fan with a hoop of little bells is used by the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> and other Orientals and is generally made of silver or brass.

<p>Apart from the foregoing <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> uses, a flabellum, in the shape of a fan, later of an umbrella or canopy, was used as a mark of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes. Two fans of this kind are used at the Vatican whenever the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is carried in state on the <em>sedia gestatoria</em> to or from the altar or audience-chamber. Through the influence of Count Ditalmo di Brozza, the fans formerly used at the Vatican were, in 1902, presented to Mrs. Joseph Drexel of Philadelphia, U. S. A., by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and in return she gave a new pair to the Vatican. The old ones are exhibited in the museum of the University of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. They are splendid creations. The spread is formed of great ostrich plumes tipped with peacock feathers; on the sticks are the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> arms, worked in a crimson field in heavy gold, the crown studded with rubies and emeralds. St. Paul's Cathedral, London, had a fan made of peacock feathers, and York Cathedral's inventory mentions a silver handle of a fan, which was gilded and had upon it the enamelled picture of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Haymo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester (died 1352), gave to his church a fan of silver with an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> handle.
