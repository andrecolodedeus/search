<h1>Flagellation</h1>  

<p>The history of the whip, rod, and stick, as instruments of punishment and of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, is a long and interesting one. The Hebrew words for "whip" and "rod", are in etymology closely related (Gesenius). Horace (Sat., I, iii) tells us not to use the <em>horribile flagellum</em>, made of thongs of ox-hide, when the offender deserves only the <em>scutica</em> of twisted parchment; the schoolmaster's <em>ferula</em> &mdash; Eng. ferule (Juvenal, Sat., I, i, 15) &mdash; was a strap or rod for the hand (see <em>ferule</em> in Skeat). The earliest <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> mention of the whip is in <a href="../bible/exo005.htm#vrs14">Exodus 5:14-16</a> (<em>flagellati sunt; flagellis c&oelig;dimur</em>), where the Heb. word meaning "to strike" is interpreted in the Greek and the Latin texts, "were scourged" &mdash; "beaten with whips". Roboam said (<a href="../bible/1ki012.htm#vrs11">1 Kings 12:11, 14</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch010.htm#vrs11">2 Chronicles 10:11, 14</a>): "My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions", i.e. with scourges armed with knots, points, etc. Even in Latin <em>scorpio</em> is so interpreted by St. Isidore (Etym., v, 27), "virga nodosa vel aculeata". <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> references to the rod might be multiplied indefinitely (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs2">Deuteronomy 25:2, 3</a>; <a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#vrs14">2 Samuel 7:14</a>; <a href="../bible/job009.htm#vrs34">Job 9:34</a>; <a href="../bible/pro026.htm#vrs3">Proverbs 26:3</a>, etc.). In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> we are told that Christ used the scourge on the money-changers (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs15">John 2:15</a>); He predicted that He and His disciples would be scourged (Mat., x, 17; xx, 19); and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says: "Five times did I receive forty <em>stripes</em>, save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods" (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs24">2 Corinthians 11:24, 25</a>; <a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs3">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>; <a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs22">Acts 16:22</a>). The offender was to be beaten in the presence of the judges (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs2">Deuteronomy 25:2, 3</a>), but was never to receive more than forty stripes. To keep within the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it was the practice to give only thirty-nine. The culprit was so attached to a Low pillar that he had to lean forward &mdash; "they shall lay him down", says the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to receive the strokes. Verses of thirteen words in Hebrew were recited, the last always being: "But he is merciful, and will forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and will not destroy them" [<a href="../bible/psa077.htm#vrs38">Psalm 77:38</a>]; but the words served merely to count the blows. Moses allowed masters to use the rod on slaves; not, however, so as to cause death (<a href="../bible/exo021.htm#vrs20">Exodus 21:20</a>). The flagellation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not a Jewish, but a Roman punishment, and was therefore administered all the more cruelly. It was suggested by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> desire to save Him from crucifixion, and this was inflicted only when the scourging had failed to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> plan flagellation was not a preparation, but rather a substitute, for crucifixion.

<p>As the earliest monuments of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> make the scourge or whip very conspicuous, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> cannot have been the first on whom the Egyptians used it. In Assyria the slaves dragged their burdens under the taskmaster's lash. In <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a> even youths of high social standing were proud of their stoical indifference to the scourge; while at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the various names for slaves (<em>flagriones</em>, <em>verberones</em>, etc.) and the significant term <em>lorarii</em>, used by Plautus, give us ample assurance that the scourge was not spared. However, from passages in Cicero and texts in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, we gather that Roman citizens were exempt from this punishment. The bamboo is used on all classes in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> heavier penalties, and frequently death itself, are imposed upon offenders. The <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> country most conspicuous at the present day for the whipping of culprits is <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, where the knout is more than a match for the worst scourge of the Romans. Even in what may be called our own times, the use of the whip on soldiers under the English flag was not unknown; and the <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">State of Delaware</a> yet believes in it as a corrective and deterrent for the criminal class. If we refer to the past, by Statute 39 Eliz., ch. iv, evil-doers were whipped and sent back to the place of their nativity; moreover, Star-chamber whippings were frequent. "In Partridge's Almanack for 1692, it is stated that Oates was whipt with a whip of six thongs, and received 2256 lashes, amounting to 13536 stripes" (A Hist. of the Rod, p. 158). He survived, however, and lived for years. The pedagogue made free use of the birch. Orbillus, who flogged Horace, was only one of the learned line who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in moral suasion, while Juvenal's words: "Et nos ergo manum ferul&aelig; subduximus" (Sat., I, i, 15) show clearly the system of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> discipline existing in his day. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Cybele scourged themselves and others, and such stripes were considered sacred. Although these and similar acts of penance, to propitiate <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, were practised even before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it was only in the religion established by Him that they found wise direction and real merit. It is held by some interpreters that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in the words: "I chastise my body" refers to self-inflicted bodily scourging (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>). The Greek word <em>hypopiazo</em> (see Liddell and Scott) means "to strike under the eye", and metaphorically "to mortify"; consequently, it can scarcely mean "to scourge", and indeed in <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs5">Luke 18:5</a>, such an interpretation is quite inadmissible. Furthermore, where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> certainly refers to scourging, he uses a different word. We may therefore safely conclude that he speaks here of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> in general, as <a href="../cathen/12075c.htm">Piconio</a> holds (Triplex Expositio).

<p>Scourging was soon adopted as a sanction in the monastic discipline of the fifth and following centuries. Early in the fifth century it is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> in the "Historia Lausiaca" (c. vi), and <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26014.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23</a>) tells us that, instead of being <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, offending young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were scourged. See the sixth-century rules of St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (P.L., LXVII, 1111), and of St. Aurelian of Arles (ibid., LXVIII, 392, 401-02). Thenceforth scourging is frequently mentioned in monastic rules and councils as a preservative of discipline (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Concilieng.", II, 594, 656). Its use as a punishment was general in the seventh century in all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the severe Columban rule (St. Columbanus, in "Regula C&oelig;nobialis", c. x, in P.L., LXXX, 215 sqq.); for later centuries of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> see <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, "Vet. ac nova ecc. disciplina, II (3), 107; <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, "Glossar. med. et infim. latinit.", s.v. "Disciplina"; <a href="../cathen/07029b.htm">Gretser</a>, "De spontane&acirc; disciplinarum seu flagellorum cruce libri tres" (Ingolstadt, 1603); Kober, "Die k&ouml;rperliche Z&uuml;chtigung als kirchliches Strafmittel gegen Cleriker und M&ouml;nche" in T&uuml;b. "Quartalschrift" (1875). The Canon law (<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Gratian, <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX) recognized it as a punishment for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>; even as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it appears in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation as a punishment for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Though doubtless at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> a private means of penance and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, such use is publicly exemplified in the tenth and eleventh centuries by the lives of St. Dominic Loricatus (P.L., CXLIV, 1017) and <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> (died 1072). The latter wrote a special treatise in praise of self-flagellation; though blamed by some contemporaries for excess of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, his example and the high esteem in which he was held did much to popularize the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> use of the scourge or "discipline" as a means of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> and penance. Thenceforth it is met with in most <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and associations. The practice was, of course, capable of abuse, and so arose in the thirteenth century the fanatical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>, though in the same period we meet with the private use of the "discipline" by such saintly <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a> and Elizabeth of Thuringia.
