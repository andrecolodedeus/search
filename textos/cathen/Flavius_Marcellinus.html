<h1>Flavius Marcellinus</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; died 12 September, 413. He was a high official (<em>tribunus et notarius</em>) at the court of <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a>, and possessed the confidence of his imperial master owing to his good sense, and unblemished conduct. In 411 Honorius sent him to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> as plenipotentiary judge, to preside and pass <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> at the great conference between the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, which began on 1 June of the same year and lasted several days. Marcellinus, who had conducted the negotiations with great patience and entire impartiality, decided in favor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whereupon new imperial decrees were published against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. The great interest which the imperial envoy showed in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and religious questions, brought about close and friendly relations between him and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who wrote him several letters, and dedicated various books to him (<a href="../fathers/1501.htm">"De peccatorum meritis et remissione"</a>, "De baptismo parvulorum", the first three books of <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"De Civitate Dei"</a>). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> also wrote him a letter. In 413 Marcellinus and his brother Apringius were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Marinus, who had crushed the rising of Heraclianus, as being alleged supporters and partisans of the latter. Jerome says the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> falsely accused him out of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> (<a href="../fathers/3011.htm"><em>Against the Pelagians</em> III.6</a>). Although St. Augustine interceded for him, and several other African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came forward in his favor, he was beheaded 12 September, 413, by order of Marinus; the latter was soon after called away from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and in the edict of 30 August, 414, which regulated the carrying out of the decrees against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, Marcellinus was referred to with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. His name is in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 6 April as that of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.
