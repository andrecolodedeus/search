<h1>Florence Conry</h1>  

<p><em>Or</em> Florence Conroy; <em>in Irish</em> Flaithri O'Maolconaire (O'Mulconry).

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, patriot, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and founder of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> (Franciscan) College of St. Anthony at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, 1560; died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 18 Nov., 1629. His early studies were made on the Continent, in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; at Salamanca he joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. In 1588 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the order in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and as such sailed with the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Spanish Armada</a>; we have no details as to the manner of his escape from the disaster which overtook that ill-fated expedition. At all times active in the interest of his native land he was again sent to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, this time by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, to aid with counsel and influence the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and their Spanish allies during the last struggle of Hugh O'Neill (Tyrone's Rebellion) for the independence of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. After the disaster of Kinsale (1601) he accompanied Hugh Roe O'Donnell (Prince of Tyrconnell) to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the hope of interesting anew the Spanish Court. But the great chieftain soon died at Simancus, being assisted on his death-bed by Father Conry (Four Masters, ad an. 1602) who also accompanied the remains to their last resting place in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church at Valladolid. Conry was deeply interested in the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at Salamanca. When the native <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chieftains, the Earl of Tyrone (Hugh O'Neill) and the Earl of Tyrconnell (Rory O'Donnell, brother of Hugh Roe), fled from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1607, Conry <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a devoted friend in their exile and accompanied them to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For the so-called "Revelations" of Christopher St. Laurence, Baron of Howth, implicating Father Conry and the principal <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> in an imaginary plot to seize Dublin Castle and raise a new rebellion just previous to the "Flight of the Earls" see <a href="../cathen/10145c.htm">Meehan</a> (cited below), pp. 67-73. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Father Conry was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> in 1609 by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>), always a warm friend of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1614 Conry wrote from Vallidolid a vigorous remonstrance to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> parliament for their cowardly adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">Bill of Attainder</a> that deprived of their estates the fugitive <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> earls and their adherents and vested six whole counties of Ulster in the English Crown. <a href="../cathen/10145c.htm">Meehan</a> says of this document that it is "stamped in its every line with the impress of a great mind" (Fate and Fortunes of the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell, Dublin, 1886, 3d ed., pp.262, 395).

<p>In 1616 Archbishop Conry founded at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> youth the College of St. Anthony of Pauda, principally with means furnished by Princess Isabella, wife of Archduke Albert, and the daughter of Philip the Second. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was himself the foremost member of this famous <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> house of studies whence came a long line of erudite and virtuous historians and archaeologists (O'Clery, <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Hugh Ward</a>, Francis Walsh, and others: cf. V. DeBuck, "L'archeologie, irlandaise, au couvent de Saint-Antoine de Padoue a Louvain", Paris, 1869), and where the most active <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> printing press on the Continent was long in operation. One of the earliest works of Conry was a translation form Spanish into very pure <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> known as "The Mirror of Christian Life", printed at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1626, but probably current in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at an earlier date, both in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and among the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> troops in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>; this was composed, as he says himself, "out of charity for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the Gael". As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, Conry never took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, owing to the royal proclamations of 1606, 1614, 1623, commanding all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, under the gravest penalties, to quit the kingdom. But he governed Tuam through vicars-general and continued to live principally at St. Anthony's in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, not improbably on the bounty of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, as was the case of many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the time. His influence in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> matters at the royal court was always considerable; thus, as late as 1618 we find him presenting to the Council of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> <a href="../cathen/11348a.htm">Philip O'Sullivan Beare's</a> "Relation of Ireland and the number of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> therein", and in the following year his own "Statement of the Severities Practised by England against the Irish Catholics". Like his fellow-Franciscan, <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09336a.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, he was ever at the disposition of his exiled countrymen. He communicated (1610) to the Council of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, a translation of the original (Irish) statement of one Francis Maguire concerning his observations in the "State of Virginia", between 1608 and 1610, a curious and unique document of the earliest English settlements in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> and the life and habits of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> (Alexander Brown, The Genesis of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 1890, I, 392-99).

<p>Archbishop Conry was a profound scholastic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, very learned especially in the writings of St. Augustine, all of whose works he read seven times, while those pertaining to grace he read some twenty times. In the interpretation of the more difficult passages he frequently had recourse to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. At <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> he sat at the feet of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, and was also a friend of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> (died 1638). He had, however, by his own efforts arrived independently at conclusions concerning the teaching of St. Augustine on grace and the character of the sufferings of such unbaptized children. His "Peregrinus Jerichontinus, h. e. de natura humana feliciter instituta, infeliciter lapsa, miserabiter vulnerata, misericorditer restaurata" (ed. Thady MacNamara, Paris, 1641) treats of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, etc., the "Pilgrim of Jerico" being <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself, the robber <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, the good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. Hunter says that this edition was owing to Arnauld, and that the same ardent <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> is possibly the author of the (Paris, 1645) French version. Conry wrote also other works expository of the teaching and opinions of the great Doctor of Grace, e.g. "de gratia Christi" (Paris, 1646); "De flagellis justorum" (Paris, 1644); "De Augustini sensu circa b. Mariae Virginis conceptionem" (Antwerp, 1619). In 1654 his body was brought back from <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and buried in the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Anthony's, near the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, where an epitaph by Nicolas Aylmer recorded his virtues, learning and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of country:--

<blockquote><p>Ordinis altus honor, fidei patriaeque honos,<br>Pontificum merito laude perenne jubar.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thomas Darcey Magee says of this patriotic scholar: "He is the leading figure in a class of exiled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> who were of a great service to religion and letters and not seldom powerful allies of their country. From the founding of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> to the composition of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> he shrank from no labour that could, according to his convictions, benefit the people of his native land."
