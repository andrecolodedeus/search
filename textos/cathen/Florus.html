<h1>Florus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer in the first half of the ninth century. We have no information regarding the place of birth, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or the youth of this distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; but it is probable that he came from the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, not however from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, as some scholars have asserted. A letter to Bishop Bartholomew of Narbonne, written between 827 and 830 and signed by Florus as well as by Archbishop Agobard and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Hildigisus, furnishes us with the first positive information we possess of his history ("Mon. Germ. Hist.: Epp. V, 206 sqq.). He was then a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, which office he continued to hold throughout his life. From the fact that at this time he already enjoyed a reputation as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, we may conclude that he was born certainly before the end of the eighth century. That he was then known (827) even outside the boundaries of the church of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> is testified by the poetic epistle written about the same time by the youthful Walahfrid Strabo to Archbishop Agobard, in which he speaks of Florus, with an allusion to his name, as a flower the fragrance of which had spread even to the banks of the Rhine ("Versus Strabi Walahfridi", viii, v, 17-24, ed. Dummler "Poetae Carol. aevi", II, 357, in "Mon. Germ. Hist.").

<p>Until about the middle of the ninth century, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> followed an active literary career he was <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, canonist, liturgist, and poet. He was considered one of the foremost authorities on theological questions among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom; and, in consequence, his opinion was often sought in important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. When, after the deposition of Archbishop Agobard of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> by the Synod of Diedenhofen (835), Bishop Modoin of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> summoned before the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> certain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Florus, in his work "De iniusta vexatione ecclesiae Lugdunensis", took issue with Modoin and defended <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> freedom. Other canonical writings of Florus are his "Capitula ex lege et canone collecta" and his treatise on the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, "De electionibus episcoporum". Another of his works, "Querela de divisione Imperii" a lament over the dissensions of the realm, was written by Florus when the kingdom was undergoing severe political disturbance occasioned by the strife between Louis the Pious and Lothair. His <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writing are: "De expositione Missae", and three treatises against Amalarius ("Opuscula contra Amalarium"). In these latter works the anthor inveighs against the famous <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius of Metz</a>, who came to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, in 835, and wished to introduce changes in the liturgy which were disapproved of by Florus. Later, Florus took part in the conflict concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which had been stirred up by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a>. Shortly after the Synod of Quiersy, in the year 849, he wrote on this subject, "De praedestinatione" and laid down the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a twofold <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and to damnation, maintaining at the same time the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of man. When John Scotus Eriugena attacked this opinion, Florus, commissioned by the church of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, wrote in 852 his work "Liber adversus Johannem Scotum" . He is also the author of commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. His next work was the completion of the Martyrology of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, to which he made additions for the various days.The chief sources on which he relied in enlarging the work are a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> from St-Pierre in M&acirc;con, and two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Echternach and Toul, which may all be found in the National Library at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> lat. 5254, 10018 and 10158). On later revisions of the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, these additions have been made use of. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> has left a number of poems. After the year 852, no further information definite as to time has come down to us regarding Florus; so that his death may be said, with probable exactitude, to have occurred about the year 860.
