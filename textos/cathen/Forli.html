<h1>Forli</h1>  

<p>(FOROLIVIENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the province of Romagna (Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>); suffragan of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The city of Forli, the ancient Forum Livii, is situated between the rivers Ronco and Montone, and was founded in 206 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by the consul M. Livius Salinator; destroyed 88 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> during the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Marius and Sulla; and rebuilt by the pr&aelig;tor Livius Clodius. During the seventh and eighth centuries it was often seized by the Lombards (665, 728, 742), until its incorporation with the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> in 757. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire it was <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>. On the downfall of the Hohenstaufen, Simone Mestaguerra had himself proclaimed Lord of Forli (1257). He was succeeded by Maghinardo Pagano, Uguccione della Faggiuola (1297), and others, until in 1302 the Ordelaffi came into power. More than once this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> sought to escape from the overlordship of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and was therefore several times expelled, e.g. in 1327-29 and again in 1359-1375 (Gil d'Albornoz). Forli was seized in 1488 by Visconti and in 1499 by C&aelig;sar Borgia, after whose death it was again directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1708 it was sacked by the Austrians.

<p>St. Mercurialis is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and is said to belong to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age; it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that he is identical with the Mercurialis present at the <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a> in 359. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, however, must have been introduced, and a see established, much earlier. Among the illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the following may be enumerated: Alessandro (1160), who built the episcopal palace; Fra Bartolomeo da Sanzetto (1351), compelled to flee by Francesco degli Ordelaffi; Giovanni Capparelli (1427), banished by Antonio degli Ordelaffi; Luigi Pirano (1437), who took an active part in the Council of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. The following were natives of Forli: Blessed Jacopo Salomonio (died 1314), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>; Blessed Pellegrino Laziosi (died 1345), a <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a>; Blessed Marcolino Amanni (died 1397), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. The Cathedral of Santa Croce existed as early as 562; in 1419 <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> ordered restorations that were completed in 1475; and it was again enlarged in 1841. A noteworthy part of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Madonna del Fuoco; the sacred image contained there was formerly in a private house, where it remained unharmed during a fire. Also worthy of mention are: the church of San Mercuriale, with its celebrated belltower, the work of Francesco Deddi (1428); San Biagio, with frescoes by <a href="../cathen/10169c.htm">Melozzo da Forli</a> and Palmegiani, and an "Immaculate Conception" by <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>; Santa Maria dei servi (built by Blessed Pellegrino, buried there), with frescoes of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has a rich collection of 500 Aldine first editions and of pictures. Near Forli is the shrine of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Grazie of Forno. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 61 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 60,000 inhabitants, 3 male and 6 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 7 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and a weekly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper.
