<h1>Formularies</h1>  

<p>(LIBRI FORMULARUM)

<p>Formularies are <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> collections of models for the execution of documents (<em>acta</em>), public or private; a space being left for the insertion of names, dates, and circumstances peculiar to each case. As is well known, it is practically inevitable that documents of the same nature, issued from the same office, or even from distinct offices, will bear a close resemblance to one another. Those charged with the execution and expedition of such documents come naturally to employ the same formul&aelig; in Similar Cases; moreover, the use of such formul&aelig; permits the drafting of important documents to be entrusted to minor officials, since all they have to do is to insert in the allotted space the particular information previously supplied them. Finally, in this way every document is Clothed with all possible efficiency, since each of its clauses, and almost every word, has a meaning clearly and definitely intended. Uncertainties and difficulties of interpretation are thus avoided, and not unfrequently lawsuits. This legal formalism is usually known as the "style" or habitual diction of <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> and the documents that issue therefrom. It represents long efforts to bring into the document all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and useful elements in their most appropriate order, and to use technical expressions suited to the case, some of them more or less essential, others merely as a matter of tradition. In this way arose a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> art of drafting public documents or private <em>acta</em>, which became the monopoly of <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> and notaries, which the mere <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> could only imperfectly imitate, and which in time developed to such a point that the mere "style" of a supposititious deed has often been sufficient to enable a skilful critic to detect the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. The earlier Roman notaries (<em>tabelliones</em>) had their own traditional formul&aelig;, and the drafting of their <em>acta</em> was subject to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of detail (see "Novels" of Justinian, xliv, lxvi); the imperial <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Byzantium were more remarkable still for their formul&aelig;. The <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> of the barbarian kingdoms and that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> followed in their footsteps. Nevertheless it is not directly from the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> that the formularies drawn up in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> have come down to us, but rather from the monastic and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Therein was taught, as pertaining to the study of law, the art of drafting public and private documents (see <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, "Glossarium med. et infim&aelig; Latinitatis", s.v. "Dictare"). It was called <em>dictare</em> as opposed to <em>scribere</em>, i.e. the mere material execution of such documents.

<p>To train the <em>dictatores</em>, as they were known, Specimens of public and private <em>acta</em> were placed before them, and they had to listen to commentaries thereon. Thus arose the yet extant formularies, between the fifth and the ninth centuries. These models were sometimes of a purely academic nature, but the number of such is small; in almost every case they are taken from real documents, in the transcription of which the individualizing references were suppressed so as to make them take on the appearance of general formul&aelig; in many instances, too, nothing was suppressed. The formul&aelig; deal with public documents: royal decrees on civil matters, ordinances, etc.; with documents relative to legal processes and the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; or with private deeds drawn up by a notary: sales, exchanges, gifts to churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, transference of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, the manumission of slaves, the settlement of matrimonial dowries, the execution of wills, etc. Finally, there are deeds which refer solely to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concerns: <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a> of churches, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of various kinds, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunications</a>, etc. The study of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> formularies is of importance for students of the history of legislation, the rise of institutions, the development of manners and customs, of civil history, above all for the criticism of charters and diplomas, and for researches in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> philology. In those times the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil orders were closely related. Many civil functions and some of the highest state offices were held by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <em>ars dictandi</em> was taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> connected with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and those under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control. For quite a long time all <em>acta</em> were drawn up only in Latin, and as the vernacular languages, in Romance lands, gradually fell away from classical Latin, recourse to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> became a matter of necessity. The formularies are, of course, anything but models of good Latinity; with the exception of the Letters (Vari&aelig;) of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, and the St. Gall collection "Sub Salomone", they are written in careless or even barbarous Latin, though it is possible that their wretched "style" is intentional, so as to render them intelligible to the multitude.

<p>The formularies of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> date from the sixth to the ninth or tenth century, and we still possess many once used in one or other of the barbarian kingdoms. Many were edited in the seventeenth century by J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bignon, <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, and others; and many more in the nineteenth century, especially by two savants who compiled collections of them: <ol><li>Eug&egrave;ne de Rozi&egrave;re, "Recueil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des formules usit&eacute;es dans l'empire des Francs du cinqui&egrave;me au dixi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle" (3 vols., Paris, 1859-71). He groups these early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> formul&aelig; under five principal heads: "Formul&aelig; ad jus publicum, ad jus privatum, ad judiciorum ordinem, ad jus canonicum, et ad ritus ecclesiasticos spectantes". And he follows up this arrangement by a very complete set of tables of concordance. <li>Karl Zeumer, "Formul&aelig; Merovingici et Karolini &aelig;vi" (Hanover, 1886) in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Leg.", V; he reproduces the formul&aelig; in the work and gives a more complete study than de Rozi&egrave;re. In his pages will be found a complete bibliography of all written on the subject before that time; or Chevalier, "Topo-Bibl.", may be consulted under the word "Formules".</ol>

<p>Some brief observations will here suffice on the formul&aelig; used between the sixth and the ninth centuries in the various barbarian kingdoms.
<h2 id="section1">The Ostrogoths</h2>



<p>Cassiodorus, secretary and afterwards prime minister of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a>, included in his "Variarum (epistolarum) libri XII", particularly in books six and seven, and, as he says, for the guidance of his successors, a great number of <em>acta</em> and letters drawn up by him for his royal master. It is a genuine formulary, though standing apart by itself. This collection dates from before 538 (P.L., LXIX). The <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Canciani took ninety-two of these formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> and included them in his "Barbarorum leges antiqu&aelig;" (Venice, 1781, I, 19-56).
<h2 id="section2">The Visigoths</h2>

<p>" Formul&aelig; Visigothic&aelig;", a collection of the forty-Six formul&aelig; made under King Sisebut (612-621). The king's name occurs twice in the curious formula xx, a dowry settlement in hexameter verse. Roman and Gothic law are followed either separately or together, according to the nationality of the covenanters. This collection was published in 1854 by de Rozi&egrave;re from a <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> Manuscript, which was copied in turn from an Oviedo Manuscript of the twelfth century, now lost.
<h2 id="section3">The Franks</h2>

<p>Their formularies are numerous: <ul><li>(a) <em>"Formul&aelig; Andecavenses"</em>, a collection made at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, consisting of sixty formul&aelig; for private <em>acta</em>, some of them <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the sixth century, but the greater number from the early part of the seventh; the last three of the collection belong to the end of the seventh century. They were first edited in 1685 by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> from an eighth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> preserved at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. <li>(b) <em>"Formul&aelig; Arvernenses"</em> (also known as "Baluzian&aelig;", from <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, their first editor, who issued the works in 1713), a collection of eight formul&aelig; of private <em>acta</em> made at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in Auvergne during the eighth century. The first of them is dated from the consulate of Honorius and Theodosius (407-422). <li>(c) <em>"Marculfi monachi formularum libri duo"</em>, the most important of these collections, and dedicated by its author to a Bishop Landri, doubtless identical with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (650-656). The first book contains thirty-seven formul&aelig; of royal documents; the second, <em>cart&oelig; pagenses</em>, or private <em>acta</em>, to the number of fifty-two. The work, which was well done, was very favourably received, and became popular as an official textbook, if not in the time of the mayors of the palace, at least under the early Carlovingians. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> it received a few additions, and was re-arranged under the title" Formul&aelig; Marculfin&aelig; &aelig;vi Karolini". Zeumer edited six formul&aelig; closely related to this collection. <li>(d) <em>"Formul&aelig; Turonenses"</em>, also known as <em>"Sirmondic&aelig;"</em> (Baluze edited them under this title because they had been discovered by P&egrave;re Sirmond in a Langres <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>). This collection, made at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, contains forty-five formul&aelig;, two of which are royal documents, many being judicial decisions, and the remainder private <em>acta</em>. It seems to belong to the middle of the eighth century. Zeumer added to the list twelve other formul&aelig; taken from various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. <li>(e) <em>"Formul&aelig; Bituricenses"</em>, a name given to nineteen formul&aelig; taken from different collections, but all drafted at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>; they date from 720 to the close of the eighth century. Zeumer added to them twelve formul&aelig; taken from the Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Vierzon. <li>(f) <em>"Formul&aelig; Senonenses"</em>, two distinct collections, both of which were made at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, and preserved in the same ninth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. The first, "Cart&aelig; Senonic&aelig;", dates from before 775, and contains fifty-one formul&aelig;, of which seven are for royal documents, two are letters to the king, and forty-two are private charters. Zeumer added six Merovingian formul&aelig;. The second collection, "Formul&aelig; Senonenses recentiores", dates from the reign of Louis the Pious, and contains eighteen formul&aelig;, of which seven deal with judicial acts. Zeumer added five metrical formul&aelig;, and two Merovingian formul&aelig; written in Tironian notes. <li>(g) <em>"Formul&aelig; Pithoei"</em> In a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> loaned by Pithou to <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a> for his "Glossarium" of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Latin there was a rich collection of at least one hundred and eight formul&aelig;, drawn up originally in territory governed by Salic law. This <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> has disappeared. Under the above heading Zeumer has collected the various quotations made by <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a> from this formulary. <li>(h) <em>"Formul&aelig; Salic&aelig; Bignonian&aelig;"</em>, so called from the name of their first editor, Bignon. It contains twenty-seven formul&aelig;, one of which is for a royal decree; they were collected in a country subject to Salic law, about the year 770. <li>(i, j) <em>"Formul&aelig; Salic&aelig; Merkelian&aelig;"</em>, so called from the name of their editor, Merkel (about 1850), a collection of sixty-six formul&aelig; taken from a Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>; they were not brought to completion until after 817. The first part (1-30) consists of formul&aelig; for private <em>acta</em>, modelled on "Marculf" and the "Formul&aelig; Turonenses"; the second part (31-42) follows the <em>"Formul&aelig; Bignonian&aelig;"</em>, the third (43-45) contains three formul&aelig; drawn up in some <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; the fourth (46-66) has formul&aelig; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the close of the eighth century and probably compiled in some episcopal town. Two formul&aelig; of decrees of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were discovered by Zeumer in the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. <li>(k) <em>"Formul&aelig; Salic&aelig; Lindenbrogian&aelig;"</em>, so called from the name of their first editor, Friedrich Lindenbrog, a Frankfort lawyer (1613) who edited them together with other documents. The collection contains twenty-one formul&aelig; of private <em>acta</em>, drawn up in Salic law territory. Four others were added by Zeumer. <li>(l) <em>"Formul&aelig; Imperiales e curia Ludovici Pii"</em>, also known as <em>"Carpenterian&aelig;"</em> from Carpentier who first edited them in his "Alphabetum Tironianum" (Paris, 1747). This is an important collection of fifty-five formul&aelig;, drawn up after the fashion of the charters of Louis the Pious at the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, between 828 and 832, The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is written mainly in Tironian notes. This collection was used by the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> chancery of the ninth Century. Zeumer has added to the list two formul&aelig;. <li>(m) <em>"Collectio Flaviniensis"</em>, one hundred and seventeen formul&aelig; compiled at the Abbey of Flavigny in the ninth century; of these, ten only are not to be met with elsewhere. <li>(n) <em>"Formul&aelig; collectionis Sancti Dionysii"</em>, a collection of twenty-five formul&aelig; made at the Abbey of St-Denys under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; for the most part it is taken from the archives of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. <li>(o) <em>"Formul&aelig; codicis Laudunensis"</em>, a Laon <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> containing seventeen formul&aelig;, of which the first five were drawn up at the Abbey of St-Bavon in <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, and the remainder at Laon.</ul>
<h2 id="section4">The Alamanni</h2>

<p>The most important of their formul&aelig; are: <ul><li>(a) <em>"Formul&aelig; Alsatic&aelig;"</em>, under which name we have two collections, one made at the Abbey of Murbach (Formul&aelig; Morbacenses) at the end of the eighth century and preserved in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of St.Gall, containing twenty-seven formul&aelig;, one of which is for a royal decree; the other embodies three formul&aelig; made at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (Formul&aelig; Argentinenses) and preserved in a Berne <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. <li>(b) <em>"Formul&aelig; Augienses"</em>, from the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>. This consists of three distinct collections: one from the end of the eighth century containing twenty-three formul&aelig; of private <em>acta</em>; another belonging to the eighth and ninth centuries contains forty-three formul&aelig; of private documents; the third, "Formul&aelig; epistolares Augienses", is a "correct letter-writer" with twenty-six formul&aelig;. <li>(C) <em>"Formul&aelig; Sangallenses"</em> (from the Abbey of St. Gall), in two collections of this name. The "Formul&aelig; Sangallenses miscellane&aelig;" consists of twenty-five formul&aelig;, many of which are accompanied by directions for their use. They date from the middle of the eighth to the end of the ninth century. The important "Collectio Sangallensis Salomonis III tempore conscripta" is so called because it seems to have been compiled by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a> at St. Gall, under Abbot Salomon III (890-920), who was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a> died in 912. It contains, in forty-seven formul&aelig;, models of royal decrees, of private documents, of <em>litter&oelig; format&oelig;</em> and other episcopal documents. Zeumer added six formul&aelig; taken from the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.</ul>
<h2 id="section5">The Bavarians</h2>

<p>Among their formul&aelig; are: <ul><li>(a) <em>"Formul&aelig; Salisburgenses"</em>, a very fine collection of one hundred and twenty-six models of documents and letters, published in 1858, by Rockinger, and drawn up at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> in the early part of the ninth century. <li>(b) <em>"Collectio Pataviensis"</em> (of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>), containing seven formul&aelig;, five of which are of royal decrees, executed at <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> under Louis the German. <li>(c) <em>"Formul&aelig; codicis S. Emmerami"</em>, fragments of a large collection made at <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram's</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>.</ul>
<h2 id="section6">Rome</h2>

<p>The most important of all ancient formularies is certainly the "Liber diurnus romanorum pontificum", a collection of one hundred and seven formularies long used by the Apostolic chancery. If it was not drawn up for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, it copies its documents, and is largely compiled from the "Registrum" or letter-book of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604). It was certainly in official use by the Roman chancery from the ninth to the end of the eleventh century. This collection was known to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> canonists, and is often quoted by Cardinal Deusdedit and <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yves of Chartres</a>; four of its documents were incorporated into the "Decretum" of Gratian. The best <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the "Liber diurnus", written at the beginning of the ninth century, comes from the Roman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme and was discovered in the Vatican Library. About the middle of the seventeenth century, the learned <a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Lucas Holstenius</a> used it when preparing an edition of the work which was officially stopped and suppressed on the eve of its appearance, because it contained an ancient profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> their predecessor Honorius. In 1680 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Garnier, using another <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the College of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (Paris), brought out an edition of the "Liber diurnus" not approved by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (P.L., CV). In the nineteenth century the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was utilized for two editions, one by de Rozi&egrave;re (Paris, 1869), the other by von Sickel (Vienna, 1889). In 1891 the Abbate Ceriani discovered at the Ambrosiana (Milan) a third <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> as yet unused. For a full bibliography of recent researches concerning the "Liber diurnus" see the "Topo-Bibl." of Chevalier, s.v. While, in its complete form, the "Liberdiurnus" cannot date back further than 786, the earliest forms of it go back to the end of the seventh century. Von Sickel holds that its opening formul&aelig; (1-63) are even fifty years earlier than that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. It is badly arranged as a collection, but wonderfully complete. After a series of addresses and conclusions for <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>, that vary according to the addressees, there are formul&aelig; concerning the installation of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of churches, the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, the grant of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and various other privileges. Then follow models for the official correspondence on the occasion of a vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the election of a pope, also directions for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>-elect; finally a group of formul&aelig; affecting various matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration.

<p>In the tenth century these formularies cease to be in universal use; in the eleventh, recourse is had to them still more rarely; other methods of training notaries are introduced. Copies of letters are no longer placed before them. In their stead, special treatises of instruction are prepared for these officials, and manuals of epistolary rhetoric appear, with examples scattered here and there throughout the text, or collected in separate books. Such treatises on composition, <em>artes dictaminis</em>, have hitherto been only partially studied and classified, chiefly by Rockinger in "Briefsteller und Formelb&uuml;cher des XI. bis XIV. Jahrhunderts" (Munich, 1863). The most ancient of these manuals known to us is the "Breviarium de dictamine" of <a href="../cathen/01259a.htm">Alberic of Monte Cassino</a>, about 1075; in the twelfth century treatises of this kind become more frequent, first in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, then in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, especially along the banks of the Loire at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. Side by side with these works of epistolary rhetoric we meet special treatises for the use of clerks in different <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a>, and formularies to guide notaries public. Such are the "Formularium tabellionum" of <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius of Bologna</a> in the twelfth century, and the "Summa artis notari&aelig;" of Ranieri of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> in the thirteenth; that of Salathiel of Bologna printed at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, in 1516, and the very popular one of Rolandino that went through many editions, beginning with the <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> edition of 1479.

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, in general very faithful to its customs and its "style", after the reform of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> many formularies and practical treatises appeared, none of them possessing an official value. The writings of <a href="../cathen/04789b.htm">Dietrich of Nieheim</a> (an employ&eacute; of the chancery in 1380), "De Stilo" and "Liber Cancellari&aelig;", have been the subject of critical studies. At a more recent date we meet many treatises on the Roman chancery and on pontifical letters, but they are not formularies, though their text often contains many models.

<p>Quite recently, however, there has appeared an official publication of certain formul&aelig; of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, i.e. the collection of formul&aelig; for matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> granted by the Dataria Apostolica (see <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">ROMAN CONGREGATIONS</a>), published in 1901 as "Formul&aelig; Apostolic&aelig; Datari&aelig; pro matrimonialibus dispensationibus, jussu Emi. Card. Pro Datarii Cajetani Aloisi-Masella reformat&aelig;".

<p>Lastly, in a different order of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, it may be well to mention a collection of formul&aelig; for use in episcopal courts, the "Formularium legalepracticum" of Francesco Monacelli (Venice, 1737), re-edited by the Camera Apostolica (3 vols. fol., Rome, 1834).

<p>From the twelfth century onward the formularies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> become more numerous but less interesting, since it is no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have recourse to them to supplement the documents.

<p>The formularies of the Cancellaria Apostolica are collections drawn up by its clerks, almost exclusively for their own guidance; they interest us only through their relation to the "Rules of the Chancery" (see <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">ROMAN CURIA</a>). The formularies of the P&oelig;nitentiaria have a higher interest for us; they appear during the twelfth century when that department of Roman administration was not restricted, as it now is, to questions of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and the <em>forum internum</em>, but served as a sort of clearing-house for lesser favours granted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, especially for <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>. These interesting documents, including the formularies, have been collected and edited by G&ouml;ller in "Die papstliche Poenitentiarie bis Eugen IV." (Rome, 1907).

<p>Previously, Lea had published "A Formulary of the Papal Penitentiary in the Thirteenth Century" (Philadelphia, 1892), probably the work of Cardinal Thomasius of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> (died 1243). We must mention the "Summa de absolutionibus et dispensationibus" of <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>; of particular value also is the formulary of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (1336 at the latest), made by order of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and long in use. It contains five hundred and seventy letters of which more than two hundred are taken from the collection of Thomasius. Attention is also directed to the list of "faculties" conferred, in 1357, on Cardinal Albornoz, first edited by Lecacheux in "M&eacute;langes d'Arch&eacute;ologie et d'Histoire des &eacute;coles fran&ccedil;aises de Rome et d'Ath&egrave;nes", in 1898; and to later texts in G&ouml;ller. It will suffice if we make a bare mention of the <em>tax&oelig;</em> or "taxes" in use at the P&oelig;nitentiaria, to which were occasionally joined those imposed by the Cancellaria; in the opinion of the writer, they are not in any way related to the formularies.
