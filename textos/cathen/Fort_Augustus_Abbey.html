<h1>Fort Augustus Abbey</h1>  

<p>St. Benedict's Abbey, at Fort Augustus, Inverness-shire, is at present the only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. It owed its inception to the desire of <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">John, third Marquess of Bute</a>, for the restoration of monasticism in a country which, before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, possessed so many glorious <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>, and in later days owned many others on the Continent. The marquess brought the matter before the superiors of the Anglo-Benedictine Congregation in 1874, promising substantial pecuniary help in the establishment of a house in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, with the understanding that when two other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> should have been founded they should all form a separate Scottish congregation. The suggestion was approved of, and the Anglo-Benedictine authorities resolved to incorporate with the Scottish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the more ancient foundation of Sts. Adrian and Denis, formerly existing at Lambspring, in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, which was peopled by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from 1645 to 1803, and when suppressed by a hostile government was afterwards resuscitated in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; inadequacy of funds had prevented any lasting restoration of this house, but with the help promised by <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">Lord Bute</a>, it seemed possible to revive it in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Dom Jerome Vaughan, a brother of Cardinal Vaughan, was appointed to superintend the work, and succeeded in collecting from rich and poor in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, sufficient means for the erection of a fine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> a cost of some &#163;70,000. A site was given by Simon, fifteenth Baron Lovat, comprising the buildings of a dismantled fort, built in 1729 and known as Fort Augustus, a title given in compliment to George Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, son of George II. The fort, originally erected for the suppression of Highland <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, had been purchased from the Government by the Lovat <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in 1867. The monastic buildings commenced in 1876 were completed in 1880. They occupy the four sides of a quadrangle about one hundred feet square. In one wing a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys of the upper classes was conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, with the assistance of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> graduates and other lay masters, for about sixteen years, but was reluctantly closed in 1894, as its distance from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the dearth of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of rank made its continuance a matter of difficulty. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was one of the pioneers of a more refined style of equipment that was usual at the time of its inception.

<p>Up to the year 1882 St. Benedict's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> remained under the jurisdiction of the Anglo-Benedictine Congregation, but in response to the wishes of the Scottish hierarchy, and of the leading Scottish nobility &#151; notably Lords Lovat and <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">Bute</a> &#151; Leo XIII, by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Summ&acirc; cum animi l&aelig;titi&acirc;", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 December, 1882, erected it into an independent <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, thus separating it from English rule. When this step had been accomplished, Lord Lovat made over the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the Scottish community, by signing the title deeds, which for a time had been held over. In 1888 Dom Leo Linse of the Beuron <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation, who had resided for more than ten years in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, part of that time as superior of Erdington Priory, near <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, was nominated <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and received the abbatial benediction at the hands of Archbishop, afterwards Cardinal, Persico, who had been sent to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> as Apostolic Visitor. In 1889, special constitutions, based upon those of the Beuron <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation, were adopted, with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, for a term of ten years. These, after certain modifications suggested by experience, received definite <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> in 1901. In 1905, in view of the exceptional position of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as an independent <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> conferred upon the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, as regards Fort Augustus Abbey, the powers ordinarily exercised by the president of a congregation. This arrangement has not only provided for regular canonical visitations at definite intervals, but has facilitated intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, under whose immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> still remains.

<p>From its foundation the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> made it a prominent <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, in accordance with the tenor of its contitutions, to fulfil St. Benedict's precept regarding the celebration with befitting solemnity of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> worship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Mass, <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> are daily celebrated with the music and ritual demanded by the varying importance of season or festival. Since 1893 the <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> version of the Gregorian melodies, since recognize as the authoritative edition of the chant, has been exclusively used in all <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services. The time that is not occupied by choir <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and other community excercises is claimed by a variety of occupations. The management of a large farm and of an adjoining estate, annually let to tenants for shooting purposes; the generation of electric light for the use of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and of many of the residents of the village; the working of a small printing press; the spiritual charge of a tract of country forty square miles in extent, containing many habitations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered over the hills; the preaching of missions, and the giving of retreats both within and without the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; the rendering of assistance to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> when required; Biblical, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, musical, artistic, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies; literary work, facilitated by a fine <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of some 20,000 volumes and some rare and precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; all these afford abundant employment to a community of about fifty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. The graceful group of buildings whose spires and turrets rise above the trees forms a conspicuous object from Loch Ness, and is visible from a distance of many miles. A church of large size, designed by Peter Paul Pugin, was commenced in 1890; a temporary wooden church has been in use since 1880.
