<h1>Fort Wayne</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF (WAYNE CASTRENSIS).

<p>The Diocese of Vincennes, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> established in 1834, comprised the whole <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">State of Indiana</a> till the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, on 22 September, 1857, created the Diocese of Fort Wayne, assigning to it that part of <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> north of the southern boundary of Warren, Fountain, Montgomery, Boone, <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>, Madison, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, and Randolph Counties, a territory of 17,431 square miles, numbering 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 14 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 20 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and two religious institutions, with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> of the Fathers, Brothers, and Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a>. The Right Rev John Henry Luers was nominated first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fort Wayne and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 10 January, 1858. He was born 29 September, 1819, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America in 1831. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 11 November, 1846. Entering upon the administration of the new diocese, he devoted himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to the founding of new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions, provided a home for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and built a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In June, 1871, during a vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">See of Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, he was called to that city to confer <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> on a number of seminarians. After the function, on his way to the train, he suffered an apoplectic stroke and fell dead (29 June, 1871). At the time of Bishop Luer's death there were in the Diocese of Fort Wayne 69 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 75 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, 1 college, 11 academies for girls, 40 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a catholic population estimated at 50,000.

<p>The Rev. Joseph Dwenger was then appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He was born near Minster, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, in 1837. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphaned</a> at an early age, he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the Fathers of the Precious Blood, entered their community, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 4 September, 1859. Appointed professor in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of his community, he filled that position until 1862, and was then assigned to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work. From 1867 to 1872 he was occupied in preaching missions. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 14 April, 1872. In 1874 Bishop Dwenger was the head of the first American <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1875 he erected an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphan asylum</a> and manual labour <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys at Lafayette. He was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system. In 1884 he attended the Third Plenary Council at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and in the following March was deputed, with Bishops Moore and Gilmour, to present the decrees of the council to the Holy Father. In 1886 he erected an asylum for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls at Fort Wayne. In 1888 and in 1891 he again went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the last time in the interest of the North American College. Soon after his return he was attacked by a lingering illness, to which he succumbed 22 January, 1893.

<p>The Right Rev. Joseph Rademacher, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, was transferred to Fort Wayne, 13 July, 1893. He was born 3 December, 1840, in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 2 August, 1863, by Bishop Luers, to whose diocese he had been affiliated. In April, 1883, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 June. At Fort Wayne Bishop Rademacher applied himself assiduously to increase the number of churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and missions. In 1896 he remodelled the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at an expense of $75,000. In 1898 his health gave way. Symptoms of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> collapse appeared and he had to relinquish the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He expired peacefully 12 January, 1900. During his illness, and until the appointment of a successor, Very Rev. J. H. Guendling, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Maurice de St. Palais of Vincennes 22 September, 1868, and appointed assistant at St. Joseph's church, Terre Haute, where he remained till 1871, attending, besides, a number of missions. From October,1871, to August, 1874, he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Cambridge City, whence he was transferred to Indianapolis and entrusted with the organization of St. Joseph's parish, where he built the church, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence. In 1885 he published "A History of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of Vincennes", a work of deep historical research and accuracy. Bishop Alerding was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Fort Wayne 30 November, 1900.
