<h1>Forty Hours' Devotion</h1>  

<p>Also called <em>Quarant' Ore</em> or written in one word <em>Quarantore</em>, is a devotion in which continuous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is made for forty hours before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> exposed. It is commonly regarded as of the essence of the devotion that it should be kept up in a succession of churches, terminating in one at about the same hour at which it commences in the next, but this question will be discussed in the historical summary. A solemn high Mass, "Mass of Exposition", is sung at the beginning, and another, the "Mass of Deposition", at the end of the period of forty hours; and both these Masses are accompanied by a procession of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and by the chanting of the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The exact period of forty hours' exposition is not in practice very strictly adhered to; for the Mass of Deposition is generally sung, at about the same hour of the morning, two days after the Mass of Exposition. On the intervening day a solemn Mass <em>pro pace</em> is offered &#151; if possible, at a different altar from the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> upon which the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed. It is assumed that the exposition and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be kept up by night as well as by day, but permission is given to dispense with this requirement when an adequate number of watchers cannot be obtained. In such a case the interruption of the devotion by night does not forfeit the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> conceded by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to those who take part in it.
<h2>History of the devotion</h2>

<p>Although the precise origin of the Forty Hours' Devotion is wrapped in a good deal of obscurity, there are certain facts which must be accepted without dispute. The <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> chronicler Burigozzo (see "Archiv. Stor, Ital.", III, 537), who was a contemporary, clearly describes the custom of exposing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in one church after another as a novelty which began at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, in May, 1537. He does not ascribe the introduction of this practice to any one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but he gives details as to the church with which it started, etc., and his notice seems to have been actually written in that year. Less than two years afterwards, we have the reply of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> to a petition soliciting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the practice. This is so important, as embodying an official statement of the original purpose of the devotion, that we copy it here: "Since [says the pontiff] . . . Our beloved son the Vicar General of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the inhabitants of the said city, in order to appease the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> provoked by the offences of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and in order to bring to nought the efforts and machinations of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> who are pressing forward to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, amongst other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practices, has established a round of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications to be offered both by day and night by all the faithful of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, before our Lord's Most Sacred Body, in all the churches of the said city, in such a manner that these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications are made by the faithful themselves relieving each other in relays for forty hours continuously in each church in succession, according to the order determined by the Vicar . . . We, approving in our Lord so <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> an institution, and confirming the same by Our authority, grant and remit", etc. (Sala, "Documenti", IV, 9; cf. Ratti in "La Scuola Cattolica" [1895], 204).

<p>The parchment is endorsed on the back in a contemporary hand, "The first concession of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>" etc., and we may feel sure that this is the earliest pronouncement of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> upon the subject. But the practice without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> spread rapidly, though the details cannot be traced exactly. Already before the year 1550 this, or some analogous exposition, had been established by <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> for the Confraternity of the Trinita dei Pellegrini in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; while <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, at about the same period, seems to have lent much encouragement to the practice, of exposing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> during the carnival, as an act of expiation for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed at that season. As this devotion also commonly lasted for a period of about two days or forty hours, it seems likewise to have shared the name "Quarant' Ore"; and under this name it is still maintained in many places abroad, more especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This form of the practice was especially promoted by the Oratorian Father, Blessed Juvenal Ancina, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a>, who has left elaborate instructions for the carrying out of the devotion with greater solemnity and decorum. It seems that it is especially in connection with these exercises, as they flourished under the direction of the Oratorian Fathers, that we trace the beginning of those sacred concerts of which the memory is perpetuated in the musical "Oratorios" of our greatest composers. Elaborate instructions for the regulation of the Quarant' Ore and for an analogous devotion called "Oratio sine intermissione" (uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>) were also issued by <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> and will be found among the Acta Mediolanensis Ecelesiae". However, the most important document belonging to this matter is the Constitution "Graves et diuturnae" of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a>, 25 Nov., 1592. In the presence of numberless dangers threatening the peace of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> and especially of the distracted state of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the pontiff strongly commends the practice of unwearied <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. "We have determined", he says, "to establish publicly in this Mother City of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (in hac alma Urbe) an uninterrupted course of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in such wise that in the different churches (he specifies the various categories), on appointed days, there be observed the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and salutary devotion of the Forty Hours, with such an arrangement of churches and times that, at every hour of the day and night, the whole year round, the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall ascend without intermission before the face of the Lord". It will be noticed that, as in the case of the previously cited <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, the keynote of this document is anxiety for the peace of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. "Pray," he says, "for the concord of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the enemies of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the dreaded <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who in the heat of their presumptuous fury threaten slavery and devastation to all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, may be overthrown by the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>". Curiously enough the document contains no explicit mention of the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, but inasmuch as this feature had been familiar on such occasions of public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> both in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself for more than half a century, we may infer that when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> speaks of "the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and salutary devotion of the Forty Hours" he assumes that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is made before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> exposed. More than a century later <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Pope Clement XII</a>, in 1731, issued a very minute code of instructions for the proper carrying out of the Quarant' Ore devotion. Upon this, which is known as the "Instructio Clementina", a word must be said later.

<p>With regard to the actual originator of the Forty Hours' Devotion there has been much difference of opinion. The dispute is too intricate to be discussed here in detail. On the whole the evidence seems to favour the conclusion that a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Father, Joseph Piantanida da Fermo, was the first to organise the arrangement by which the Forty Hours' Exposition was transferred from church to church in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and was there kept up without interruption throughout all the year (see Norbert in the "Katholik", Aug., 1898). On the other hand, the practice of exposing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> with solemnity for forty hours was certainly older; and in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> itself there is good evidence that one Antonio Bellotto organized this in connexion with a certain confraternity at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the Holy Sepulchre as early as 1527. Moreover, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Thomas Nieto, the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a>, St. Antonio Maria Zaccharia, and his friend, Brother Buono of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, known as the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermit</a>, have all been suggested as the founders of the Forty Hours' Devotion. The claims of the last named, Brother Buono, have recently been urged by Bergamaschi ("La Scuola Cattolica", <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Sept., 1908, 327-333), who contends that the Quarant' Ore had been started by Brother Buono at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> in 1529. But the evidence in all these cases only goes to show that the practice was then being introduced of exposing the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> with solemnity on occasions of great public calamity or peril, and that for such expositions the period of forty hours was generally selected. That this period of forty hours was so selected seems in all probability due to the fact that this was about the length of time that the Body of Christ remained in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was left in the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Sepulchre. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> speaks as if this practice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for forty hours was of very ancient date; and he distinctly refers it to the forty hours our Lord's Body remained in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, seeing that this was a period of watching, suspense, and ardent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on the part of all His disciples. In all probability this was the exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The practice of reserving the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> with some solemnity in the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Sepulchre began in the thirteenth or fourteenth century; and seems in some places, e.g. at <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, to have been popularly known as the "Prayer [or Supplication] of the Forty Hours". From this the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> grew up of transferring this figurative vigil of forty hours to other days and other seasons. The transference to the carnival tide was very obvious, and is likely enough to have occurred independently to many different people. This seems to have been the case with Father Manare, S.J., at <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, c. 1548, but probably the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> suggested itself to others earlier than this.
<h2>Rubrical requirements</h2>

<p>The "Instructio Clementina" for the Quarant' Ore which has been already mentioned stands almost alone among <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> documents in the minuteness of detail into which it enters. It has also been made the subject of an elaborate commentary by Gardellini. Only a few details can be given here. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is always, except in the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, to be exposed upon the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. Statues, pictures, and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in the immediate neighbourhood are to be removed or covered. At least twenty candles are to be kept burning day and night. The altar of exposition is only to be tended by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> wearing <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplices</a>. Everything is to be done, e.g. by hanging curtains at the doorways, by prohibiting the solicitation of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, etc., to promote recollection and silence. There must be continuous relays of watchers before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; and these, if possible, should include a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or cleric in higher orders who alone is permitted to kneel within the sanctuary. At night the great doors of the church must be closed and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> excluded. No Masses must be said at the altar at which the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed. Precise regulations are made as to the Masses to be said at the time of Exposition and Deposition. Except on greater feasts, this Mass must he a solemn votive Mass <em>de Sanctissimo Sacramento.</em> No bells are to be rung in the church at any private Masses which may be said there while the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed. When a votive Mass <em>de Sanctissimo Sacramento</em> cannot be said, according to the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, the collect of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is at least to be added to the collects of the Mass. No <a href="../cathen/12776d.htm">Requiem Masses</a> are permitted. As already intimated, the Mass <em>pro pace</em> is to be sung on the second day of the Exposition; and the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are to be chanted under conditions minutely specified, at the conclusion of the procession both at the opening and close of the Quarant' Ore. Finally it may be said that this "Instructio Clementina" is the foundation upon which is based the ritual for all ordinary Benedictions and Expositions. For example, the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> at the words "Genitori Genitoque" of the <a href="../cathen/14445b.htm">"Tantum Ergo"</a>, the use of the humeral veil, and the giving of the Blessing with the <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a>, etc., are all exactly prescribed in section thirty-one of the same document.
