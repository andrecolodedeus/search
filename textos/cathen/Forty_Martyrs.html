<h1>Forty Martyrs</h1>  

<p>A party of soldiers who suffered a cruel death for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, near <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, in Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, victims of the persecutions of Licinius, who, after the year 316, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Christians of the East</a>. The earliest account of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> (370-379), in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> delivered on the feast of the Forty Martyrs (Hom. xix in P.G., XXXI, 507 sqq.). The feast is consequently more ancient than the episcopate of Basil, whose eulogy on them was pronounced only fifty or sixty years after <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which is thus historic beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. According to St. Basil, forty soldiers who had openly confessed themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were condemned by the prefect to be exposed naked upon a frozen pond near Sebaste on a bitterly cold night, that they might freeze to death. Among the confessors, one yielded and, leaving his companions, sought the warm baths near the lake which had been prepared for any who might prove inconstant. One of the guards set to keep watch over the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> beheld at this moment a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> brilliancy overshadowing them and at once proclaimed himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, threw off his garments, and placed himself beside the thirty-nine soldiers of Christ. Thus the number of forty remained complete. At daybreak, the stiffened bodies of the confessors, which still showed signs of life, were burned and the ashes cast into a river. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, collected the precious remains, and the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were distributed throughout many cities; in this way the veneration paid to the Forty Martyrs became widespread, and numerous churches were erected in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.

<p>One of them was built at <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, in Cappadocia, and it was in this church that St. Basil publicly delivered his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>. <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> was a special client of these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Two discourses in praise of them, preached by him in the church dedicated to them, are still preserved (P.G., XLVI, 749 sqq., 773 sqq.) and upon the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he laid them to rest beside the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the confessors. <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a>, the Syrian, has also eulogized the forty Martyrs (Hymni in SS. 40 martyres). <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, who was an eye-witness, has left us (<a href="../fathers/26029.htm"><em>Church History</em> IX.2</a>) an interesting account of the finding of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in Constantinople through the instrumentality of the Empress Pulcheria. Special devotion to the forty <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> was introduced at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> into the West. <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> in the beginning of the fifth century (d. about 410 or 427), received particles of the ashes of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> during a voyage in the East, and placed them with other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in the altar of the basilica which he had erected, at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of which he delivered a discourse, still extant (P.L., XX, 959 sqq.) Near the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Antiqua, in the Roman Forum, built in the fifth century, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was found, built, like the church itself, on an ancient site, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Forty Martyrs. A picture, still preserved there, dating from the sixth or seventh century, depicts the scene of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The names of the confessors, as we find them also in later sources, were formerly inscribed on this fresco. Acts of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, written subsequently, in Greek, Syriac and Latin, are yet extant, also a "Testament" of the Forty Martyrs. Their <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the Greek, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, on 9 March.
