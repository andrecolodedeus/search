<h1>Fossors</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>fossores</em>, <em>fossarii</em> from <em>fodere</em>, to dig).

<p>Grave diggers in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a> in the first three or four centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. The determination, from the first days of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">inter</a> the mortal remains of the faithful in cemeteries reserved exclusively to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, brought into existence the class of workmen known as fossors. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fossor corresponded in a general way with those of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <em>vespillones</em>, but whereas the latter were held in anything but esteem in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the fossors from an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> were ranked among the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Wieland, Ordines Minores, 1897), an excellent example of the elevating influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on the lowest orders of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. An interesting literary reference to fossors, in their character of one of the orders of the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, is found in the "Gesta apud Zenophilum", an appendix to the work of <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus of Mileve</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. Speaking of the "house in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> assembled" at <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> in the year 303, during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, this writer enumerates first the higher orders of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> present, from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and then mentions by name the fossors Januarius, Heraclus, Fructuosus, <em>et ceteris fossoribus</em> ("Opp. S. Optati", ed. C. Ziwsa, in "Corpus Script. Eccl. Lat.", <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1893, XXVI, 187). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> also (Ep. xlix) alludes to fossors as <em>clerici</em>, and a sixth-century chronicle edited by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a> (Spicil. Rom., IX, 133) enumerates the orders of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as <em>ostiarius, fossorius, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a></em>, etc. At first the fossors seem to have received no regular salary, but were paid by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> for the work accomplished; with the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, they appear to have been paid from the common treasury. In the fourth century the corporation of fossors were empowered to sell burial spaces, as we learn from inscriptions. For example, in the cemetery of St. Cyriacus two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> bought from the fossor Quintus a <em><a href="../cathen/02590a.htm">bisomus</a></em>, or double grave, <em>retro sanctos</em> (near a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>), and there are several other references to this practice. The corporation of fossors, there is good reason to believe, did not consist merely of the labourers who excavated the galleries of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>; it included also the artists who decorated the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, as appears from another allusion in the "Gesta apud Zenophilum" already cited. According to this authority two fossors were brought before the judge <em>(inductis et adplicitis Victore Samsurici et Saturnino fossoribus</em>); when interrogated as to their calling, one replied that he was a fossor, the other that he was an <em>antifex</em>. The latter term at that period included the professions of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>. Thus it would seem that this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is generically referred to as a fossor is also an artist.

<p>Among the representations of fossors in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> the one best known, through <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> "Fabiola", is that of the fossor Diogenes, discovered by Boldetti. The picture, which was seriously injured in an attempt to remove it from the wall, represents Diogenes with his pick over his right shoulder and a sack, probably containing his midday meal, on his left shoulder, while in his left hand he carries a staff with a light attached. The inscription reads: DIOGENES FOSSOR, IN PACE DEPOSITVS, OCTABV KALENDAS OCTOBRIS (the fossor Diogenes, <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in peace, the eighth day before the calends of October). The oldest fresco of a fossor, or rather of two fossors, dating from the latter half of the second century, is in one of the so-called Sacrament Chapel in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of St. Callistus. The figures are represented pointing toward three Eucharistic scenes, probably to indicate another of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, which was to exclude unauthorized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from taking part in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> celebrations held occasionally in the cemeteries in commemoration of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Representations of fossors are usually near the entrance of the subterranean cemeteries.
