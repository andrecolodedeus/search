<h1>Foulque de Neuilly</h1>  

<p>A popular <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> preacher, d. March, 1202. At the end of the twelfth century he was <em>cur&eacute;</em> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Neuilly-sur-Marne, in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (now the department of seine-et-Oise). According to Jacques de Vitry he once led an irregular life, but experienced a sudden conversion. Ashamed of his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to study under Pierre, a chanter of Notre Dame. It was not long before his master noticed his earnestness and had him preach in the church of Saint-S&eacute;verin before a number of students. His eloquence was so great that he was thought to be inspired by the Holy Ghost. Large crowds assembled to hear him in the Place Champeaux where he was wont to preach. He was especially severe in his denunciation of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a> and dissolute women. In 1195, according to Rigord with the assent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he began to preach in neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and soon afterwards met with successively in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, at Lisieux and Caen, later at <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Picardy, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. He was credited with <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">power to work miracles</a>, and from every quarter the sick were brought to him, whom he cured by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. After 1198 he preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a> amid much popular enthusiasm. He declared later that in three years he had given the cross to 200,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. According to Jean de Flixecourt, it was Pierre le Chantre who pointed out his ability as a preacher to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. In November, 1198, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred upon him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> powers, with the right of choosing his assistants among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> (Historiens de France, XIX, 369). The chief of these were Pierre de Proussi, Rustache, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Flai, and Herloin, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Saint-Denis. Herloin even led a band of Breton <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Saint-Jean d'Acre</a>. In 1200 many nobles of Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had taken the cross. On the nineteenth of March of that year Foulque preached at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (Hist. de France, XVIII, 616). After Boniface of Montserrat had been chosen leader of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> Foulque gave him the cross at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>. In 1201 he assisted at the chapter of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> with Boniface, and entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> a portion of the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> he had collected for the Holy Land. There used to repair the ramparts of Acre and <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, but he had aroused distrust, and his later success was slight. He returned to Neuilly, where he restored the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, which is still in existence. When Foulque died, he was regarded as a saint. He had taken a decisive part in the preparation for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> of 1204.
