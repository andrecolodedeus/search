<h1>Four Crowned Martyrs</h1>  

<p>The old guidebooks to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> make mention, in connection with the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus on the Via Labicana, of the Four Crowned Martyrs (<em>Quatuor Coronati</em>), at whose grave the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> were wont to worship (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Roma sotterranea, I, 178-79). One of these itineraries, the "Epitome libri de locis sanctorum martyrum", adds the names of the four <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (in reality five): "IV Coronati, id est Claudius, Nicostratus, Simpronianus, Castorius, Simplicitus". These are the names of five <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> in the quarries of Pannonia (now a part of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, south-west of the Danube), who gave up their lives for their Faith in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. The Acts of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, written by a revenue officer named Porphyrius probably in the fourth century, relates of the five <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> that, although they raised no objections to executing such profane images as Victoria, Cupid, and the Chariot of the Sun, they refused to make a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of &AElig;sculapius for a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temple. For this they were condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. They were put into leaden caskets and drowned in the River Save. This happened towards the end of 305. The foregoing account of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the five <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> of Pannonia is substantially authentic; but later on a legend sprang up at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> concerning the <em>Quatuor Coronati</em>, according to which four <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldiers (<em>cornicularii</em>) suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, two years after the death of the five <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>. Their offence consisted in refusing to offer sacrifice to the image of &AElig;sculapius. The bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at St. Sebastian and <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Melchiades</a> at the third milestone on the Via Labicana, in a sandpit where rested the remains of others who had perished for the Faith. Since the names of the four <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> soldiers could not be authentically established, <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Melchiades</a> commanded that, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their death (8 November) being the same as that of the Pannonian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, their anniversary should be celebrated on that day, under the names of Sts. Claudius, Nicostratus, Symphorianus, Castor, and Simplicius. This report has no historic foundation. It is merely a tentative explanation of the name <em>Quatuor Coronati</em>, a name given to a group of really authenticated <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who were buried and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the catacomb of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus, the real origin of which, however, is not known. They were classed with the five <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Pannonia in a purely external relationship. Numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> on the legend as well as the Roman Martyrology give the names of the Four Crowned Martyrs, supposed to have been revealed at a later date, as Secundus, Severianus, Carpoforus, and Victorius. But these four <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were not buried in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>; their feast was celebrated on 7 August, under which date it is cited in the Roman Calender of Feasts of 354. These <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> have no connection with the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> described above. Of the four Crowned Martyrs we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only that they suffered death for the Faith and the place where they were buried. They evidently were held in great veneration at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, since in the fourth and fifth century a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was erected and dedicated in the Caelian Hill, probably in the neighbourhood of spot where tradition located their execution. This became one of the titular churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was restored several times and still stands. It is first mentioned among the signatures of a Roman council in 595. <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Pope Leo IV</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> removed, about 850, from the Via Labicana to the church dedicated to their memory, together with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the five Pannonian <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, which had been brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at some period now unknown. Both group of martyrs are commemorated on 8 November.
