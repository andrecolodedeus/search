<h1>Fourth Council of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>(EIGHTH GENERAL COUNCIL.)

<p>The Eighth General Council was opened, 5 October, 869, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Saint Sophia, under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a>. During the preceding decade grave irregularities had occurred at Constantinople, among them the deposition of the Patriarch Ignatius and the intrusion of Photius, whose violent measures against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> culminated in the attempted deposition (867) of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>. The accession that year of a new emperor, Basil the Macedonian, changed the situation, political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. Photius was interned in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; Ignatius was recalled, and friendly relations were resumed with the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Both Ignatius and Basil sent representatives to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> asking for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. After holding a Roman synod (June, 869) in which Photius was again condemned, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent to Constantinople three <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to preside in his name over the council. Besides the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople there were present the representatives of the Patriarchs of Antioch and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and, towards the end, also the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. The attendance of Ignatian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was small enough in the beginning; indeed there were never more than 102 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were asked to exhibit their commission, which they did; then they presented to the members of the council the famous formula (<em>libellus</em>) of Pope Hormisdas (514-23), binding its signatories "to follow in everything the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and teach all its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> . . . in which communion is the whole, real, and perfect solidity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>". The Fathers of the council were required to sign this document, which had originally been drawn up to close the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The earlier sessions were occupied with the reading of important documents, the reconciliation of Ignatian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had fallen away to Photius, the exclusion of some Photian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and the refutation of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statements of two former envoys of Photius to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the fifth session Photius himself unwillingly appeared, but when questioned observed a deep silence or answered only in a few brief words, pretending blasphemously to imitate the attitude and speech of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> before <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. Through his representatives he was given another hearing in the next session; they appealed to the canons as above the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the seventh session he appeared again, this time with his consecrator George Asbestas. They appealed, as before, to the ancient canons, refused to recognize the presence or authority of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, and rejected the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, though they offered to render an account to the emperor. As Photius would not renounce his usurped claim and recognize the rightful patriarch Ignatius, the former Roman <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunications</a> of him were renewed by the council, and he was banished to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Bosporus, whence he did not cease to denounce the council as a triumph of lying and impiety, and by a very active correspondence kept up the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of his followers, until in 877 the death of Ignatius opened the way for his return to power. <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, in its last remnants, and the interference of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs were denounced by the council. The tenth and last session was held in the presence of the emperor, his son Constantine, the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> king, Michael, and the ambassadors of Emperor Louis II.

<p>The twenty-seven canons of this council deal partly with the situation created by Photius and partly with general points of discipline or abuses. The decrees of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> and <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> against Photius and in favour of Ignatius were read and confirmed, the Photian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> deposed, and those <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Photius reduced to lay communion. The council issued an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> requesting his confirmation of its Acts. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> signed its decrees, but with reservation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> action. Here, for the first time, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> recognized the ancient claim of Constantinople to the second place among the five great <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>. Greek <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, however, was offended by the compulsory signature of the aforesaid Roman formulary of reconciliation, and in a subsequent conference of Greek <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> the newly-converted <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> were declared subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople and not to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Though restored by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, Ignatius <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> ungrateful, and in this important matter sided with the other Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> in consummating, for political reasons, a notable <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; the territory henceforth known as <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> was in reality part of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> that had always belonged to the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> until the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> Leo III (718-41) <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> withdrew it and made it subject to Constantinople. Ignatius very soon <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and sent thither many Greek missionaries, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire. On their way home the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> were plundered and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; they had, however, given to the care of Anastasius, Librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (present as a member of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> embassy) most of the submission-signatures of the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. We owe to him the Latin version of these documents and a copy of the Greek Acts of the council which he also translated and to which is due most of our documentary <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the proceedings. It was in vain that <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> and his successor threatened Ignatius with severe penalties if he did not withdraw from <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> his Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> never regained the vast regions she then lost. (See PHOTIUS; <a href="../cathen/07647a.htm">IGNATIUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>; <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">NICHOLAS I</a>.)
