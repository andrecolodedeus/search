<h1>Fourth Lateran Council (1215)</h1>  

<p>From the commencement of his reign <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> had purposed to assemble an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>, but only towards the end of his pontificate could he realize this project, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 19 April, 1213. The assembly was to take place in November, 1215. The council did in fact meet on 11 November, and its sessions were prolonged until the end of the month. The long interval between the convocation and the opening of the council as well as the prestige of the reigning pontiff, were responsible for the very large number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who attended it, it is commonly cited in canon law as "the General Council of Lateran", without further qualification, or again, as "the Great Council". <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> found himself on this occasion surrounded by seventy-one <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, including the Patriarchs of Constantinople and of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, four hundred and twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and nine hundred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>. The Patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were represented by delegates. Envoys appeared from <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, from Henry Latin Emperor of Constantinople, from the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and from other princes. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself opened the council with an allocution the lofty views of which surpassed the orator's power of expression. He had desired, said the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to celebrate this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> before he died. He declared himself ready to drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the Passion for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, for the succour of the Holy Land, and to establish the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After this discourse, followed by moral exhortation, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presented to the council seventy decrees or canons, already formulated, on the most important points of dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. Dogmas were defined points of discipline were decided, measures were drawn up against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and, finally, the conditions of the next <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> were regulated.

<p>The fathers of the council did little more than approve the seventy decrees presented to them; this <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, nevertheless, sufficed to impart to the acts thus formulated and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the value of ecumenical decrees. Most of them are somewhat lengthy and are divided into chapters. The following are the most important: <ul><li>Canon 1: Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. <li>Canon 2: Condemnation of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Flora</a> and of Amaury. <li>Canon 3: Procedure and penalties against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and their protectors. <li>Canon 4: Exhortation to the Greeks to reunite with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and accept its maxims, to the end that, according to the Gospel, there may be only one fold and only one shepherd. <li>Canon 5: Proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy recognized by all antiquity. After the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, primacy is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> in the following order: Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. (It is enough to remind the reader how long an opposition preceded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> this recognition of Constantinople as second in rank among the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>.) <li>Canon 6: Provincial councils must be held annually for the reform of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, especially those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <li>Canon 8: Procedure in regard to accusations against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, this canon was of considerable importance in criminal law, not only <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> but even civil. <li>Canon 9: Celebration of public worship in places where the inhabitants belong to nations following different rites. <li>Canon 11 renews the ordinance of the council of 1179 on free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in connexion with every <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. <li>Canon 12: Abbots and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> are to hold their general chapter every three years. <li>Canon 13 forbids the establishment of new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, lest too great diversity bring confusion into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <li>Canons 14-17: Against the irregularities of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> &#151; e.g., incontinence, drunkenness, the chase, attendance at farces and histrionic exhibitions. <li>Canon 18: Priests, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> are forbidden to perform surgical operations. <li>Canon 19 forbids the blessing of water and hot iron for judicial tests or ordeals. <li>Canon 21, the famous "Omnis utriusque sexus", which commands every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who has reached the years of discretion to confess all his, or her, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> at least once a year to his, or her, own (i.e. <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This canon did no more than confirm earlier legislation and custom, and has been often but wrongly, quoted as commanding for the first time the use of sacramental confession. <li>Canon 22: Before prescribing for the sick, physicians shall be bound under pain of exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to exhort their patients to call in a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and thus provide for their spiritual welfare. <li>Canons 23-30 regulate <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> elections and the collation of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. <li>Canons 26, 44, and 48: Ecclesiastical procedure. <li>Canons 50-52: On marriage, impediments of relationship, publication of <a href="../cathen/02255a.htm">banns</a>. <li>Canons 78, 79: <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> shall wear a special dress to enable them to be distinguished from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes must take measures to prevent <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Christ.</ul> The council, moreover, made rules for the projected <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, imposed a four years' peace on all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples and princes published <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and enjoined the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to reconcile all enemies, The council confirmed the elevation of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> to the German throne and took other important measures Its decrees were widely published in many provincial councils.
