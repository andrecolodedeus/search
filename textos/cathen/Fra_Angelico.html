<h1>Fra Angelico</h1>  

<p>A famous <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the Florentine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, born near Castello di Vicchio in the province of Mugello, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, 1387; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1455. He was christened Guido, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name being Pietro he was known as Guido, or Guidolino, di Pietro, but his full appellation today is that of "Blessed Fra Angelico Giovanni da Fiesole". He and his supposed younger brother, Fra Benedetto da Fiesole, or da Mugello, joined the order of Preachers in 1407, entering the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>. Giovanni was twenty years old at the time the brothers began their art careers as illustrators of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and Fra Benedetto, who had considerable talent as an illuminator and miniaturist, is supposed to have assisted his more celebrated brother in his famous frescoes in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Marco in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Fra Benedetto was superior at San Dominico at <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a> for some years before his death in 1448. Fra Angelico, who during a residence at <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> had come under the influence of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> whose work at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> was within easy reach, soon graduated from the illumination of <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> and choir books into a remarkably naive and inspiring maker of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">religious paintings</a>, who glorified the quaint naturalness of his types with a peculiarly <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. He was convinced that to picture <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> perfectly one must need be Christlike, and <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> says that he prefaced his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. His technical equipment was somewhat slender, as was natural for an artist with his beginnings, his work being rather thin dry and hard. His spirit, however, glorified his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. His noble holy figures, his beautiful <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, human but in form, robed with the hues of the sunrise and sunset, and his supremely earnest <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are permeated with the sincerest of religious feeling. His early training in miniature and illumination had its influence in his more important works, with their robes of golden <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, their decorative arrangements and details, and pure, brilliant colours. As for the early studies in art of Fra Angelico, nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> shows the influence of the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siennese</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and it is thought he may have studied under Gherardo, Starnina, or Lorenzo Monaco.

<p>On account of the struggle for the pontifical throne between <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>, Fra Giovanni and his brother, being adherents of the first named, had in 1409 to leave Fiesole, taking refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of their order established at <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> in Umbria. The pest devastating that place in 1414, the brothers went to <a href="../cathen/04401a.htm">Cortona</a>, where they spent four years and then returned to Fiesole. There Fra Angelico remained for sixteen years. He was then invited to Florence to decorate the new Convent of San Marco which had just been allotted to his order, and of which Cosmo de' Medici was a munificent patron. At Cortona are found some of his best pictures. It was at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, however, where he spent nine years, that he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> his most important works. In 1445, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a> invited Fra Angelico to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and gave him work to do in the Vatican, where he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for him and for his successor, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a>, the frescoes of two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. That of the <em>cappella del Sacramento</em>, in the Vatican, was destroyed later by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> than asked him to go to <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> to work in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Madonna <em>di San Brizio</em> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. This work he began in 1447, but did not finish, returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the autumn of that year. Much later the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was finished by <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Luca Signorelli</a>. Pope Eugenius is said to have offered the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> the place of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, which through modesty and devotion to his art he declined. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, besides his great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the Vatican, he executed some beautiful miniatures for choral books. He is buried in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> <em>sopra Minerva</em>.

<p>Among the thirty works of Fra Angelico in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Marco in Florence (which has been converted into a national museum) is notable the famous "Crucifixion", with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> between the two thieves surrounded by a group of twenty <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and with bust portraits of seventeen <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> fathers below. Here is shown to the full the mastery of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in depicting in the faces of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the emotions evoked by the contemplation of heavenly mysteries. In the Uffizi Gallery are "The Coronation of the Virgin", "The Virgin and Child with Saints", "Naming of John the Baptist", "The Preaching of St. Peter", "The Martyrdom of St. Mark", and "The Adoration of the Magi", while among the examples at the Florence Academy are "The Last Judgement", "Paradise", "The Deposition from the Cross", "The Entombment", scenes from the lives of St. Cosmas and St. Damian, and various subjects from the life of Christ. At Fiesole are a "Madonna and Saints" and a "Crucifixion". The predella in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> is in five compartments and shows <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the Banner of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> surrounded by a choir of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and a great throng of the blessed. There is also there an "Adoration of the Magi". At Cortona appear at the Convent of San Domenico the fresco "The Virgin and Child with four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>" and the <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> "Virgin and Child with Saints", and at the baptistry an "Annunciation" with scenes from the life of the Virgin and a "Life of St. Dominic". In the <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> Gallery "Two Angels kneeling on Clouds", and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the Corsini Palace, "The Ascension", "The Last Judgment", and "Pentecost". At the Louvre in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> are "The Coronation of the Virgin", "The Crucifixion", and "The Martyrdom of St. Cosmas and St. Damian". Berlin has, at the Museum, a "Last Judgment", and Dublin, at the National Gallery, "The Martyrdom of St. Cosmas and St. Damian". At <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> is "The Annunciation", in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> "Scenes from the Lives of St. Cosmas and St. Damian", and in St. Petersburg a "Madonna and Saints". Mrs. John L. Gardner has in the art gallery of her <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> residence an "Assumption" and a "Dormition of the Virgin". There are other works at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. At San Marco, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in addition to the works already mentioned are "Madonna della Stella", "Coronation of the Virgin", "Adoration of the Magi", and "St. Peter Martyr". The Chapel of St. Nicholas in the Vatican at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> contains frescoes of the "Lives of St. Lawrence and St. Stephen", "The Four Evangelists", and "The Teachers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". In the gallery of the Vatican are "St. Nicholas of <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>", and "Madonna and Angels". The work at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> finished by <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Signorelli</a> shows <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in "a glory of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with sixteen <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>".
