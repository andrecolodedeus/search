<h1>Fra. Guglielmo Agnelli</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">Sculptor</a> and architect, b. at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, probably in 1238; d. probably in 1313. He was a pupil of <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Niccolo Pisano</a>, who had then brought the art of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> to a great perfection, modelled on Greek and Roman <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, matured by the study of actual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and preserving only such traditions of the earlier <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as seemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> at a time when art was truly the handmaid of religion. Agnelli joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in 1257, as a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. He was soon engaged in work on the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the brethren at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and built the campanile of the Abbey of Settimo, near Florence. His best work is the series of marble reliefs executed, in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Pisano</a>, for the famous <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> in the church of that Saint at Bologna. The figures on the funeral urn, in Mezzo-rilievo, are about two feet high. Fra Guglielmo's work on the posterior face of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> deals with six <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> legends, vis: the Blessed Reginald smitten by a distemper; the Madonna healing a sick man and pointing to the habit of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, indicating that he should assume it; the same man freed from a terrible temptation by holding St. Dominic's hands; <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> having his vision of St. Dominic supporting the falling Lateran Basilica; Honorius examining the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> rule, and his solemn <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of it. This work afforded little scope to Fra Guglielmo's <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> powers, but its masterly execution places him among the greatest artists of his time, second only to his master, <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Niccolo Pisano</a>. On the other hand, the figures show some faultiness characteristic of the period in the stiffness and lack of finish in the extremities. They are also crowded into too narrow limits. Fra Guglielmo and Niccolo also embellished the upper <a href="../cathen/04379b.htm">cornice</a> of the urn with <a href="../cathen/01092a.htm">acanthus</a> leaves and birds. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no more of Fra Guglielmo until 1293 when we find him occupied on the famous Cathedral of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. Though his share in the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of this edifice is not fully established, it is believed that the <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> are in great part his work. The length of time he spent at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> is also unknown. In 1304 he was engaged on works of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and architecture at his native <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and was called upon to adorn the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Michele di Borgo with historical <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>. These labours, together with his work on other parts of that church, and the construction of a <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, engaged him for the remaining nine years of his life. Fra Guglielmo was not only the foremost among the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, but according to Marachese, "by reason of his many and important works, deserves to be ranked among the grandest <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, far excelling all contemporaries. Arnolfo, Giovanni Pisano, and his master excepted."
