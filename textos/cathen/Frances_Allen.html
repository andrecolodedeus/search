<h1>Frances Allen</h1>  

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of New England birth to become a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, born 13 November, 1784, at Sunderland, Vermont; died 10 September, 1819, at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Her origin, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and environment were calculated to make her the least likely <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to take such a step. Her father was Ethan Allen the patriot, soldier of the Revolution, and pioneer of the state of <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist</a>. He married as his third wife a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, Frances Montressor, 16 February, 1784, and Frances was born 13 November, of the same year. After Ethan Allen's death, 12 February, 1789, Mrs. Allen, five years later, married Dr. Jabez Penniman. While not an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist</a>, like Allen, Dr. Penniman was sufficiently averse to religion to exclude every thought of it, as far as possible, from his stepdaughter's mind. Notwithstanding this, her keen and inquiring <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> led to her acquiring such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion that when she was twenty-one she asked leave of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> ostensibly to learn French, but in reality to become more familiar in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practices of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They consented, but first required her to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the Rev. Daniel Barber, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister of Claremont, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>. She became a pupil of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, in 1807. One day, a Sister requested her to place some flowers on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, recommending her also to make an act of adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Jesus Christ</a> in the tabernacle. When the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> attempted to step into the sanctuary she found herself unable to do so. After three futile attempts, she was filled with conviction of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, and fell upon her knees in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> adoration.

<p>She was instructed and received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, her lack of proper disposition having rendered that conferred by Mr. Barber invalid. At her first Communion she felt within her an unmistakable vocation to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> promptly withdrew her from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and sought by bestowing on the young girl every worldly pleasure and social enjoyment to obliterate the religious sentiments with which she was imbued. The pleasure and excitement of such a life did not distract her from the desire of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and as soon as the year, which she had consented to pass with her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> before taking any step in the matter, was at an end, she returned to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and entered the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, making her <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> on 18 May, 1811. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was thronged, many American friends coming to witness the strange spectacle of Ethan Allen's daughter becoming a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. After eleven years of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> life in religion, Frances Allen died at the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, of lung trouble, 10 September, 1819.
