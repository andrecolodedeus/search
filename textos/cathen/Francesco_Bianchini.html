<h1>Francesco Bianchini</h1>  

<p>A student of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and an historian, b. at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 13 December, 1662; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 March, 1729. At first he devoted himself to the study of mathematics, <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>; later he also took a course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1699 he was advanced to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a>, but never became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1684 he transferred his residence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he found at once a protector in Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, of whose <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> he became custodian. When the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> became <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Pope Alexander VIII</a> (1689-91) he still extended his favours to Bianchini; after Alexander's death, his nephew, also Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, lodged the scholar in his own palace. Bianchini received also many <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> and commissions of trust from succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. In 1703 he was elected president of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> devoted to the study of historical antiquities; he was made secretary of the commission for the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">reform of the calendar</a> and he was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat destined for Rohan Soubise. During this journey he was received everywhere with consideration by the learned. The <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a> furnished the expenses of his sojourn in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1724-30) appointed him historiographer of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at the Lateran, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1725). He was a member of many learned academies in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and elsewhere. He was distinguished for "a great purity of life and an exceeding modesty of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>", as the canons of St. Mary Major expressed it in his epitaph. His chief works are: "Two Dissertations on the Calendar and the Cycle of Julius Caesar, and the Paschal Canon of St. Hippolytus" (Rome, 1703); "A Solution of the Paschal Problem" (Rome, 1703); one volume of "A Universal History" (Rome, 1697); an edition of the "Liber Pontoficalis" in four volumes, three of which were edited by himself (Rome, 1718-29), and the fourth by his nephew, <a href="../cathen/02541b.htm">Giuseppe Bianchini</a> (Rome, 1735). Besides the text of the lives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> the work contains learned introduction, various readings of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, copious notes by himself and others, and several documents relative to the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. It was republished in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXXVII-CXXVIII.
