<h1>Francesco Chieregati</h1>  

<p>(C<font size=-2>HIEREGATO</font>)

<p>Papal <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, 1479; d. at Bologna, 6 December, 1539. Little is known of his early career. He was sent by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1515-17), and also filled a similar office in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1519), in which latter country he became acquainted with Cardinal Adrian Florent, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> preceptor of Charles VI, and later <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Pope Adrian VI</a>. One of the latter's first acts, after his entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was to make Chieregati, whose learning and virtue the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> esteemed, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14514b.htm">Teramo</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>; he then sent him to the Diet of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, called for the autumn of 1522. He was commissioned to obtain from the German princes a more energetic pursuit of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, which nation was then and long after the bulwark of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, also a more vigorous suppression of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> and the execution of the Edict of Worms against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. In two discourses (19 November and 10 December) he urged the princes to co-operate for the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; on the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> he also demanded the immediate execution of the Edict of Worms (26 May, 1521), whereby <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had been put under the ban of the empire, which formal outlawry he had hitherto escaped through the protection of Frederick of Saxony and other friendly princes. Finally, on 3 January, 1523, Chieregati read publicly two important documents, sent after him from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They were a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> (issued on the previous 25 November) to the members of the Diet and an Instruction for Chieregati himself. The former contained an eloquent appeal to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, immemorial religious traditions, and magnanimity of the representatives of the German people, and besought the Diet to quench at once the brand of religious sedition and compel the submission of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his adherents. The personal Instruction, issued probably on the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and read to the Diet by Chieregati, is one of the most important documents for the early history of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. In it Pope Adrian frankly confesses that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were the chief cause of the grievous tribulations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> itself, both head and members, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, had been guilty of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> abuses. For the text of the Instruction see Raynaldus, "Ann. Trid." (Louvain, 1781), II, 144 sqq.; Pallavicino "Storia del Concilio di Trento" (Rome, 1656), I (2), 4-6; especially Wrede, "Deutsche Reichstagskten" (Munich, 1893), III, 391; see below, Pastor, and Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch. The reply of the Diet was discouraging; the princes and representatives avoided a satisfactory answer to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> urgent requests, proposed the celebration of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> in some German city, and renewed in an offensive manner the earlier antipapal complaints of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, the famous "Centum (101) gravamina teutonicae nationis"; Pastor adds (op. cit. 97) that the failure of Chieregati was in large measure owing to the timidity and selfishness of the great German <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who were by no means ready to repeat the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confession of the noble-hearted <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The latter has often been blamed for his frankness (see remarks of Pallavicino in Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch), but Pastor (p. 94) defends him both from exaggeration of facts and untimeliness of speech. His unique and heroic admissions were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, says this writer, in the interest of a genuine reformation, nor was this remarkable Instruction made public without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval. The subsequent history of Chieregati offers like interest.
