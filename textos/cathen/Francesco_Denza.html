<h1>Francesco Denza</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> meteorologist and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 7 June, 1834; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 December, 1894. He joined the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> at the age of sixteen, and during his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> studied at the same time meteorology and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> under <a href="../cathen/13669a.htm">Father Secchi</a>. From 1856 until 1890 he was attached to the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> college at Moncalieri where he became widely known for his work in meteorology, a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which he greatly advanced not merely by his personal observations and studies but also by the interest which he roused in it throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1859 Denza founded the "Bullettino mensile di Meteorolgia", which was continued until 1894, and established a meteorological observatory at Moncalieri; it was largely through his influence that similar observatories, more than 200 in number, were gradually built in various parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The success which attended his efforts gave him a national reputation, and in 1866 Senator Matteucci and Signor Berti, minister of public instruction, urged him to take charge of the department of meteorology at Florence. Denza did not accept the post, but in the following year, at Berti's invitation, he read a paper on meteors at the "Instituto Superiore" in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. In 1872 he began a series of researches on terrestrial magnetism with special reference to magnetic declination, which illness, however, prevented him from completing. In 1883 the Duke of <a href="../cathen/01591c.htm">Aosta</a> invited him to take charge of the scientific <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his three sons. In the same year he was director of the literary and scientific section of the National Exposition at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> and chairman of its jury of awards. He represented <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1884 at the Congress of Scientific Societies of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, presiding over the meteorological section. He visited <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> on this occasion, where he was received with much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He likewise represented the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> congress of 1887, when the plan was formulated of making a photographic map of all the stars in the heavens down to the fourteenth magnitude; through his influence the Vatican observatory was one of the eighteen chosen to carry out this important project. Denza was appointed director of the <a href="../cathen/15309a.htm">Vatican Observatory</a> in September, 1890, and thenceforth lived at the Vatican. Here he inaugurated the work of this observatory in stellar photography. At the time of his death, which was due to apoplexy, he was President of the Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei. In character Denza was a man of simple <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.

<p>Among his published works may be mentioned: "Meteore cosmiche" in "Scienza di populo" (Milan, 1869); "Stelle cadente del periodo di Agosto 1868" (ibid.); "Le aurore pol. d. 1869 ed i fonom. cosmiche che accompagnarono" (1869); "Distribuzione di pioggia in Italia" (1871-72); "Valeurs de l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; et l'ozone &agrave; Moncalieri &agrave; l'&eacute;poque du chol&eacute;ra" in "Comptes Rendus" (1868) LXVI; "Le armonie dei cieli, Nozioni di astron." (1881); "Amplitudes d'oscillations diurn. magnet. &agrave; Moncalieri 1880-81"; "Osserv. di declin. magnet. ad Aosta, Moncalieri e Firenze in occas. d'eclisse sol 26/5 1873" in "Proc. Acc. dei Nuov. Lincei".
