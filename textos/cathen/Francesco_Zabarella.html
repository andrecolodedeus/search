<h1>Francesco Zabarella</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, celebrated canonist, born at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, 10 August, 1360; died at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, 26 September, 1417. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at Bologna (1378-83) chiefly under the famous Giovanni di Lignano, and at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he was graduated in 1385. He taught canon law at Florence (1385-90) and at Padua (1390-1410). Having taken <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> in 1385, he became vicar of <a href="../cathen/01096b.htm">Bishop Acciajuoli</a> of Florence and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Pruncta near Florence. After the resignation of <a href="../cathen/01096b.htm">Bishop Acciajuoli</a> in 1386, Zabarella was elected his successor, but he <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had previously appointed another as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1398 he was made <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Padua. The Paduan Government repeatedly employed him on diplomatic missions, and towards the end of 1404, he was one of two ambassadors sent to King Charles VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to obtain the latter's assistance against <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which was preparing to annex Padua. When Padua had become part of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic in 1406, Zabarella became a loyal supporter of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In 1409 he took part in the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> as councillor of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. On 18 July, 1410, <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> referendary, and on 6 June, 1411, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal deacon</a> with the titular church of SS. Cosma e Damiano.

<p>Though he never received major orders, he was one of the most active and influential <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, whose interests he supported at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1412-3). When this council failed to end the lamentable <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> sent Cardinals Zabarella and De Challant as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to King Sigismund at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a> in October, 1413, with full powers to come to an understanding with the latter concerning the place and time for holding a new council. It was arranged to open the new council at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>, 1 November, 1414, where Zabarella was one of the chief supporters of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. When the latter fled from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> 20 March, 1415, in order to thwart the election of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Zabarella remained as his representative. It was chiefly through his influence that <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> finally resigned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> unconditionally in April, 1415. Nevertheless the council continued its proceedings against <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John</a>, and commissioned Zabarella with four other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to inform him of his suspension, and, later, of his formal deposition by the council. In the proceedings against the <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Avignonese Pope Benedict XIII</a>, Zabarella proposed, at the session held 28 Nov., 14167, that Benedict be cited before the council. He also took part in the proceedings of the council against <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Huss</a>, Jerome of Prague, and Jean Petit. His attempts to induce the two former to signed a softened form of retraction <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> useless. From April till the end of July he sought to regain health and strength at a neighbouring watering place. On 28 July he was again at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and up to the time of his death exerted all his influence to hasten the election of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He is buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Padua.

<p>His most important literary production is an ecclesiastico- political treatise, "De schismatie" (Strasburg, 1515). It consists of independent portions, written at different intervals (1403-5-6- 8), and contains various suggestions for ending the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. His chief canonical writings are: "Lectura super Clementinis" (Naples, 1471); "Commentarius in libros Decretalium" (Venice, 1502); "Consilia" (Venice, 1581). He also wrote "De felicitate libri III" (Padua, 1655); "De arte metrica"; "De natura rerum diversarum"; "De corpore Christi": and a few small juridical treatises. A large number of his letters are in the imperial library of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Cod. Lat. 5513.
