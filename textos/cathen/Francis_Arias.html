<h1>Francis Arias</h1>  

<p>Writer of <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises, born at Seville in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1533, died in that place, 15 May, 1605. He was received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at the age of twenty-six. He was professor of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> at Trigueros, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college in the latter place and also at <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>. His works are "Spiritual Profit", "Treatise on the Rosary", "Imitation of Our Lady", <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>, "Mental Prayer", "The Use of the Sacraments", "The Promises of God", "The Turpitude and Grievousness of Sin". Most of them have been translated into various languages. His life corresponded with his teachings. He was held in the highest esteem by the great master of the spiritual life, <a href="../cathen/08469a.htm">John of Avila</a>, and St. Francis of Sales, in the "Introduction to a Devout Life", recommends the perusal of his works. He was commonly regarded as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and was remarkable for his gift of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and his spirit of penance. Much of his time was devoted to the care of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, and the inmates of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>. From his earliest youth his predilection for spiritual thing manifested itself, his career as a student in Alcal&aacute; was brilliant, and while a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> he laboured as an apostle in his native city of Seville. At his death it was difficult to protect his body from the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the people, who proclaimed him a saint and endeavoured to secure parts of his apparel as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.
