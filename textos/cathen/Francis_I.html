<h1>Francis I</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; b. at Cognac, 12 September, 1494; d. at Rambouillet, 31 March, 1547. He was the son of Charles of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, Count of <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>, and Louise of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and the husband of Claude of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, daughter of Louis XII. He succeeded to the throne 1 January, 1515, not as son-in-law, since the Salic Law did not permit succession through <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but as cousin of Louis XII, who had no male heir. His victory at Marignano (1515) over the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> who were defending Maximilian Sforza established the young king's reputation in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He took advantage of this at "the interview of Bologna" to bring to a successful termination the efforts of his predecessors, Charles VII and Louis XI, to impose on <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> the concordat which governed the organization of the French Church from that time till the end of the old regime (see <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">FRANCE</a>). This marked the beginning of a series of measures destined to establish in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the preponderance of the royal power. Francis I sought by every means, even by exceptional tribunals, to destroy among the nobles, both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <em>seigneurs</em> (lords), the spirit of independence. The formula of royal edicts "car tel est notre bon plaisir" (because it is our good pleasure) dates from his reign. The death of Emperor Maximilian I (1519) led Francis I to dispute the imperial crown with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles of Austria</a> who had recently inherited the crown of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The latter became emperor as <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. Surrounded on the south, north-east, and east by the states of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, Francis I, immediately after his interview of the Field of the Cloth of Gold with <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1520), began the struggle with the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> which was to be prolonged, with occasional truces, until 1756. Four successive <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> filled the reign of King Francis. The first, famous for the exploits and death of Bayard, the "chevalier sans peur et sans reproche", the treason of the Constable de Bourbon, the defeat of Francis I at Pavia (1525), and his captivity, ended with the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1526), by which he ceded <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. The second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, rendered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the refusal of the deputies of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to become the subjects of the emperor, and marked by the alliance between Francis I and the Italian princes, among them <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a> (League of Cognac, 1526), brought about the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the imperial troops under the command of the Constable de Bourbon (1527), and ended with the Peace of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (1529), in reality no more than a truce. After its conclusion, Francis I, who had lost his wife, Claude of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1524, wedded Eleanor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, sister of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. The third <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, entered upon by Francis I after he had reorganized a permanent national army, and at the time when <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> had undertaken an expedition against <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, was marked by the entrance of the French troops into <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and the entrance of the troops of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> into Provence (1536); it was brought to an end, thanks to the mediation of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>, by the treaty of Aigues-Mortes. The fourth <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, resulting from the ambitious designs of Francis I on <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, was marked by the alliance of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> with <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, by the French victory of Ceresole (1544), and was ended by the Treaties of Crespy and Ardres (1544 and 1546).

<p>The history of no other reign has been so profoundly studied in modern times as that of Francis I. A series of recent works has brought out the originality and novelty of his political maxims. The struggle against the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> made Francis I the ally of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, whose niece, Catherine, had married Henry II, the future King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">CATHERINE DE' MEDICI</a>), but he could not prevail upon <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> to grant a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII of England</a>. Impelled by the desire to menace <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> not only on the frontiers but even in the interior of his territory, Francis I sent his agents into <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who fostered political and religious <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> and favoured the political ascendency of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes. His policy in this respect was opposed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests and even opposed to those of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, for, after having in 1522 and 1523 sent Antonio Rincon to the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the Voivode of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> to urge them to threaten <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> on the eastern frontier of the empire, Francis I thought of utilizing the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> against the emperor. Before he had even thought of this alliance rumours spread throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> held him responsible for the victories of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> at <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a> and <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>. Francis I entered into negotiations with the Sultan Soliman in 1526 through his agent Frangipani, and in 1528 through Antonio Rincon. The Progress of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> between 1528 and 1532 injured the reputation of Francis I. He then secured the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in the Italian peninsula and in the Western Mediterranean. Then followed his negotiations with <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> (1533-34), at that time master of all North Africa. In 1535 his ambassador Jean de la Forest was sent to <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> to arrange for a campaign against the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, and to the sultan to secure his alliance with Francis I in order to preserve the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> balance of power. From these negotiations of Jean de la Forest date the abandonment by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <em>la Chr&eacute;tient&eacute;</em>, or <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and, on the other hand, her protection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the East (see <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">FRANCE</a>).

<p>Francis I played the part of a M&aelig;cenas in the spread of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He invited from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the great artists <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, Rosso, Primaticcio, Benvenuto Cellini, and Andrea del Sarto. He began the present Louvre, built or decorated the ch&acirc;teaux of Fontainebleau and Chambord, and was patron of the poets Marot and du Bellay. His most valuable service to <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> was the foundation of the Coll&egrave;ge de France, intended originally for the teaching of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. He was also the founder of the Imprimerie Royale. While he permitted the development in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> circles of certain <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> simultaneously with <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, he was on the other hand, after 1534, quite hostile to the propagation of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> among the common people, as is shown by his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (1545) of the Vaudois of Chabri&egrave;res and M&eacute;rindol. The poems of Francis I, though interesting as historical documents, are mediocre work. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and that of his wife, Claude of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in St. Denis, were designed by Philibert Delorme, and executed by Pierre Bontemps.
