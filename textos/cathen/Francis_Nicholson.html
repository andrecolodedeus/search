<h1>Francis Nicholson</h1>  

<p>A controversial writer; b. at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, 1650 (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> 27 Oct.); d. at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 13 Aug., 1731. The son of Henry or Thomas Nicholson, a Manchester citizen, when sixteen he entered University College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, as a servitor, and took his degrees as <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">Bachelor of Arts</a> (18 June, 1669) and Master of Arts (4 June, 1673). <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Ordained an Anglican clergyman</a>, he officiated, first about Oxford, afterwards near <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, where he gained some success in reconciling <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. A sermon preached at St. Mary's, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, on 20 June, 1680, led to his being charged with unorthodox <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the fact that he had been a pupil of Obadiah Walker <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be suspected of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> tendencies. The actual date of his reception into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is unknown, but during the reign of James II (1685-88) he was a professed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and busied himself in the king's interests. At this time he wrote the appendix on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, and the "Vindication of two recent discourses" on the same subject, added to <a href="../cathen/15702b.htm">Abraham Woodhead's</a> "Compendious Discourse on the Eucharist", published in 1688. After the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">revolution</a> he joined the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> at Nieuport in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, but his health was unequal to this austere life, and in 1699 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. There he entered the service of the Queen Dowager, Catharine of Braganza, whom he accompanied back to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. For some years he resided at the Portuguese Court and then retired to an estate which he had bought at Pera, half a league south of the Tagus, and not, as the writer in the "Dictionary of National Biography" oddly asserts, the "suburb of Constantinople". He spent a: considerable period there in devotion and study, until reaching his seventieth year he made over all his real and personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the English College at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, subject to the discharge of his <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>, the provision of board and lodging for the remainder of his life, and a small annuity. Three years before his death at the college he sent back to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquary, Dr. Cuthbert Constable, all the surviving <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/15702b.htm">Abraham Woodhead</a>, which had passed into his hands as executor of Obadiah Walker. With them also he sent his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> life of Constable, published with additions in his edition of that author's "Third Part of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> Account of Church Government".
