<h1>Francis Nugent</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Order</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and the Rhenish Provinces of said order; b. in 1569 at Brettoville, near <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, according to some; according to others at Moyrath County Meath; d. at Charleville, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1635.

<p>His father was Sir Thomas Nugent of Moyrath and his mother was the Lady Mary, daughter of Lord Devlin. At an early age he was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to receive an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> denied him at home. Before the age of twenty he obtained the degree of doctor at the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and occupied chairs in these two centres of learning, prior to his entrance into religion. He acquired a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Hebrew, and could speak a number of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages fluently. In 1589 he joined the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Flandro-Belgian Province, taking the name of Francis. In due course he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Towards the close of 1594, or the beginning of 1595 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to guide the destinies of the French provinces then being formed and established communities at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and Charleville. Meanwhile he continued to deliver lectures in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1596 he went as custos-general of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to the general chapter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was appointed commissary general of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Three years later, being again in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> he took part in a public disputation in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at which <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> himself presided. Father Francis maintained his thesis with skill and eloquence, and was enthusiastically awarded the palm of victory.

<p>At the general chapter of 1599 he was relieved of the provincialate and returned to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where he remained about eleven years. In 1610, at the earnest request of John Zwickhard <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> of this province were sent to establish the order in the Rhine country, and Father Francis was appointed their commissary general. He founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1612, and two years later communities were settled at Essen M&uuml;nster, and <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. He also established the Confraternity of the Passion at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and amongst its first protectors were his two great friends <a href="../cathen/01258b.htm">Mgr Albergatti</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, and Frederick of Hohenzollern the dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1615 he began a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> nominated him <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and commissary general with full power to establish the order in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. That country was then passing through a period of terrible <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> braved every danger, mingled with the people, and ministered to their spiritual needs. Meanwhile, in 1618 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Charleville, in Upper Champagne, became a training-school for <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> intended for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission, and facilities for the same purpose were offered by the Flandro-Belgian Province. A fresh band of workers was soon sent to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and Father Nugent was thus enabled to found the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Dublin in 1624. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, Dr. Fleming, in 1629 addressed to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a letter commending the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> specially mentioning "their learning, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and earnestness". Two years later Father Nugent founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Slane, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of his friend, <a href="../cathen/04660b.htm">Dr. Dease</a>, who had previously borne public testimony to the merits of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. Owing to failing health, he retired in 1631 to Charleville. He is generally credited with having procured the foundation at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for the free <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor youths from Ulster and Meath for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He died at Charleville on the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Feast of the Ascension</a>, 1635. <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a> described him as "a man of most ardent zeal and most exemplary piety", and the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a> of the order state that he refused the Archbishopric of Armagh offered him by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, who styled him "the support of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the light of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>". He wrote several works, of which the principal are: "Tractatus De Hibernia", "Cursus philosophicus et theologicus", "De Meditatione et Conscienti&aelig; examine", "Paradisus contemplantium", "Super regula Minorum, Expositio Copiosa".
