<h1>Francis Patrick Cardinal Moran</h1>  

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, b. at Leighlinbridge, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 16 Sept., 1830; d. at Manly, <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, 16 Aug., 1911. He was the only son of Patrick Moran and Alice Cullen, sister of <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a>. Of his three sisters, two became <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, one of them offered her life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in care of cholera patients whom she nursed, and died the last victim of the plague in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Both his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> died before his eleventh year. He left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1842 to pursue his studies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His "Acta Publica" in universal <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was so masterful as to gain for him the doctorate by acclamation. Among the principal objectors was Cardinal Joachim Pecci, afterwards <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who was impressed by the genius of his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> student. He was appointed vice-rector at the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, and also filled the chair of Hebrew at <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and was some time vice-rector of the Scotts College. In 1886 he was appointed secretary to <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a>, and professor of Scripture at Clonliffe College. He founded the "Irish Ecclesiastical Record". In 1869 he accompanied <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> for one of the absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>Selected as co-adjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Olba</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was distracted by dissension between the infirm <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dr. Walsh, and some of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people. Dr. Moran ruled with a firm yet benign hand, and his episcopate was fruitful of much spiritual and temporal advancement in the diocese. He established many religious institutions. At Callan was founded the Convent of St. Brigid's Apostolic school, which has blessed with the missionary spirit so many distant lands. He introduced the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> also into the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> workhouses, and transformed those dens of misery into homes for the indigent and poor. He established industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls under the guidance of the Sisters of Charity, and was the pioneer in that grand network of child industrial training which has since become the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He completed the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> of and adorned the Killkenny Cathedral, added a new wing to St. Kiernan's College, and founded the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and arch&aelig;ological <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. He always defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of people and championed Home Rule. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> her deeply. He was consulted by W. E. Gladstone prior to the introduction of his Home Rule Bills, and his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of commercial, industrial, and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions was a source of wonder to the prime minister, who ever afterwards cherished for him a profound respect and affection. His great diplomatic skill secured for him the confidence of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and he represented then in many of their most delicate negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Thought the Benjamin of the episcopate, he was selected as one of the secretaries to the first <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> of Maynooth. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of Dr. Moran's translation to Sydney was issued 21 March, 1884. In the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> farewell audience with <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, it was evident that the intrigues of parties, the interference of government agencies, and the influence of high <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> had made the matter almost impossible of decision by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. In the presence of others the Holy Father said clearly: "We took the selection into our own hands. You are Our personal appointment." In his first outward journey he drew up that spiritual program which gave such a colouring to his after life. "I must esteem nothing save the service of the Redeemer, everything else is besides my mission; Ich dien [I serve] in its highest meaning must be my motto . . . . To do the will of my Divine Master must be my life, my light, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my all."

<p>In 1886 he travelled 2500 miles over land and sea, and visited all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of New Zealand. In the following year he traversed 6000 miles to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Dr. Gibney at Perth. In subsequent years he went to <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>, <a href="../cathen/02349a.htm">Bathurst</a>, Bendigo, <a href="../cathen/07380c.htm">Hobart</a>, Goldburn, <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>, and Rockhampton for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of their respective <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. In 1908 he revisited and dedicated the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">Auckland</a>, and in the last year of his life he again covered 6000 miles to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Dr. Clune <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Perth. He <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> fourteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> nearly five hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, dedicated more than five thousand churches, and professed more than five thousand <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The thirty-two charities which he founded in the city of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> remain as the crowning achievement of his life. As a statesman he forecasted the necessity of Australian federation, an Australian navy, and an Australian citizen soldiery. By sheer force of character he pressed these questions on the public mind, and lived long enough to see a Federal Labour Ministry remodelling the class legislation of past centuries and equitably evolving the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes, the first unit of an Australian navy patrolling Australian waters, and the first 100,000 Australian youths called into disciplinary camps. Rt. Rev. Dr. Hoare, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>, was first named to assist Cardinal Moran in the administration of the Archdiocese. He was unable to leave <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and Rt. Rev. Dr. Higgins was appointed <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, March, 1889. He was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/13105c.htm">Rockhampton</a> on 4 May, 1899, and now occupies the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>. On 20 July, 1901, Dr. Kelly, director of the Irish College, was appointed auxiliary, cum jure successionis, and succeeded the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at his death. A quarter of a million people witnessed the funeral procession through the heart of the city of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. By permission of the State Government and of the municipal authorities he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> with the pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in his beloved St. Mary's Cathedral.
