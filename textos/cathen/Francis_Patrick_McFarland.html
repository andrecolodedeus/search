<h1>Francis Patrick McFarland</h1>  

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a> born at Franklin, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 16 April, 1819; died at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, 2 October, 1874. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, John McFarland and Mary McKeever, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from Armagh. From early childhood Francis had a predilection for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> state. Diligent and talented, he was employed as teacher in the village <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but soon entered Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, where he graduated with high honours and was retained as teacher. The following year, 1845, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 18 May, at New York by Archbishop Hughes, who immediately detailed the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to a professor's chair at St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>. Father McFarland, however, longed for the direct ministry of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and from his college made frequent missionary journeys among the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. After a year at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a> he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Watertown, N.Y., where his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was felt for many miles around. On March, 1851, he was transferred by his new ordinary, Bishop McCloskey of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, to St. John's Church, Utica. For seven years the whole city was edified by his "saintly labours", and the news of his apostolic achievements reached as far as <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was appointed Vicar-Apostolic of Florida, 9 March, 1857. He declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> only to be elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, 14 March, 1858, and resided in that city until the division of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1872 (see <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">DIOCESE OF PROVIDENCE</a>). Failing health prompted him, while attending the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His confr&eacute;res of the American episcopate would not hear of such a step. They had learned to regard him as the embodiment of the virtues of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and one of the brightest ornaments of their order. By dividing the diocese it was hoped that his burden would be sufficiently lightened. He left Providence for <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a> 28 February, 1872. After reorganizing his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he immediately set about the erection of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and to his enlightened initiative is owing the splendid edifice of which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Connecticut are so justly proud. Bishop McFarland displayed rare wisdom in the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and self-sacrifice carried him everywhere, preaching, catechizing, lecturing, moving among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people as a saint and scholar. He was a man of fine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and commanding presence. Austere and thoughtful, he always preserved a quiet dignity and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant of Christ. He collected a valuable <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which he bequeathed to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His death at the early age of fifty-five was mourned as a calamity. His name is still a household word among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Connecticut.
