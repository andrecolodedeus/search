<h1>Francis Plowden</h1>  

<p>Son of William Plowden of Plowden Hall, b. at Shropshire, 8 June, 1749; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 4 Jan., 1819. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a> and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Watten in 1766. When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a>, he was teaching at the College at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. Not being in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> he was, by the terms of <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression</a>, relieved of his first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and soon afterwards married Dorothea, daughter of George Phillips of Carnarvonshire. He entered the Middle Temple and practiced as a conveyancer, the only department of the legal profession open to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a>. After the relief Act of 1791 he was called to the Bar. His first great work, "Jura Anglorum", appeared in 1792. It was attacked in a pamphlet by his brother Robert, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> under the title of "A Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Clergyman". The book was so highly thought of that the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a> presented him with the honorary degree of D.C.L., a unique distinction for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of those days. His improvidence, extreme views, and intractable disposition made his life a troubled one. Having fallen out with the Lord Chancellor, he ceased to practice at the bar and devoted himself to writing.

<p>His "Historical Review of the state of Ireland" (1803) was written at the request of the Government; but it was too outspoken a condemnation to meet their views, and was attacked by Richard Musgrave in the "Historical Review" and also by the "British Critic". Plowden answered by a "Posthumous Preface" giving an account of his communications with Addington, and also by a "Historical Letter" to Sir Richard Musgrave. While in Dublin (1811) he published his work "Ireland since the Union" which lead to a prosecution on the part of the Government for <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a>, resulting in a verdict of &#163;5000 damages. Plowden considered that this was rewarded by a packed jury and determined not to pay it. He escaped to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he spent the remaining years of his life in comparative poverty. He continued to write at intervals, his "Historical Letters" to Sir John Cops Hippisley (1815) containing important matter connected with the question of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> emancipation. His other works are: "The Case Stated" (Cath. Relief Act, 1791); "Church and State" (London, 1794); "Treatise on the Law of Usury" (London, 1796); "The Constitution of the United Kingdom" (London, 1802); "Historical Letters to Rev. C. O'Connor" (Dublin, 1812); "Human Subornation" (Paris, 1824).
