<h1>Francis Qui&ntilde;ones</h1>  

<p>(Quignonez.)

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, born in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1482; died at <a href="../cathen/15359b.htm">Veroli</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 5 Nov., 1540. He was the son of Diego Fernandez de Qui&ntilde;ones, Count of Luna, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> as a page of Cardinal Ximenes, and at the age of sixteen entered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a> (Spain), taking the name of Francis of the Angels (1498). Having completed his studies, he successively discharged all the various offices of his orders as custos, commissary general, and minister general. In 1521 he had obtained special permission and faculties from <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to go to the missions in America, together with Father Glapion, O.F.M., confessor of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, but Glapion died in the same year, and Qui&ntilde;ones was elected commissary general of the Ultramontane <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (1521-23). In the general chapter of the order at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, in 1523, he was elected minister general (1523-27). As general, he visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1523-25), and a great part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (1525-27), promoted studies, maintained general discipline, and was not less active in behalf of missions. In 1524 he sent twelve missionaries to Mexico, among them Father Juan Juarez, who later became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> within the present territory of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. (See Engelhardt, "The Missions and Missionaries of California", <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, 1908, I, 604).

<p>After the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> (May, 1527), Qui&ntilde;ones, who was distantly related to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and also his confidant, seemed the aptest man to effect the release of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and a full reconciliation between him and the emperor. He was thrice sent to the emperor for this purpose, and his efforts were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with success by the deliverance of Clement (Dec., 1527), and the treaties of Barcelona (1528) and Cambrai (1529). As these embassies rendered his effective government of the order impossible, Qui&ntilde;ones renounced the generalship in December, 1527, and in September of the following year he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the title of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, hence his name "Cardinal of the Holy Cross". From 1530 to 1533 he was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363a.htm">Coria</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and for a short time, in 1539, administrator of Acerno (Naples), but he was never <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, as some authors assert. Cardinal Qui&ntilde;ones always occupied a distinguished position in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> and closely followed the movement of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. When <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> contemplated assembling a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, he sent (1536) the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of the Holy Cross to Ferdinand I, King of the Romans and of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, to promote that cause. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, however, did not live to see the opening of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in 1545. His body was brought from <a href="../cathen/15359b.htm">Veroli</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and buried in his titular church in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> which he had prepared himself.

<p>Qui&ntilde;ones left some legislative compilations for his order, but is best known for his reform of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> undertaken by the order of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>.
