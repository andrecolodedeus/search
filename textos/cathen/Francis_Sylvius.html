<h1>Francis Sylvius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, born at Braine-le-Comte, Hainault, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 1581; died at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, 22 February, 1649. He was remarkable from an early age for his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of study and his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. After completing his humanities at Mons, he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> founded by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Province of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> in connection with the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. While studying <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the royal college. On 9 November, 1610, he was made doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> with the highest honours. The faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> wished to retain this promising scholar, but there was no chair vacant. An eminent professor, Barth&eacute;lemy Pierre de Lintra, resigned his position in favour of Sylvius, but, upon the death of <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">Estius</a> (20 September, 1613), the great light of the University of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, Sylvius succeeded him and later was called to direct the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in which he had been a student. He was appointed (1 February, 1618) canon of the collegiate Church of St. Amat, and finally dean (28 January, 1622), and to this title was added that of vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Henceforth, absorbed by study and the discharge of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, his life was tranquil and undisturbed for thirty years until his death. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the choir of the Church of St. Amat, and an epitaph engraved on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> recalled, with his titles and qualities, his attachment to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> as a faithful disciple of one and a lucid interpreter of the other, also his liberality towards the poor and religious, whom he made his heirs.

<p>To his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and austerity, which were admirable, he united an unchangeable attachment to sound doctrines. At the commencement of his works, as at the beginning of his lectures, he never failed to profess his intention to remain always united to the Faith, and submissive to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. When in 1648 the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> sought to win the University of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> over to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, Sylvius opposed them vigorously; but throughout the controversy he preserved the moderation and sweetness of his character; always refraining from angry responses to the attacks of his opponents. He gained his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> chiefly through his commentary on the "Summa" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. With that of Cajetan it ranks among the best, and many even prefer it on account of its clearness and fullness; besides, Sylvius wrote after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and profited by its decisions. It contained four folio volumes, which he was prevailed upon to publish. He wrote also several treatises on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> and controversy, and some on <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. Among his other works may be mentioned: (1) an edition with valuable notes, of Binsfeld's "Enchiridion theologiae pastoralis", which had great success in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where it was the first manual of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> used by seminarians; (2) resolutions of cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, in which he showed himself a Probabilist, moderate, solid, and clear. He wrote also commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, the learning, conciseness, and penetration of which were praised by Calmet. He adapted the "Instructions" of St. Charles Borromeo for use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and he made additions to the "Summa Conciliorum" of <a href="../cathen/03376a.htm">Carranza</a>. His complete works were published by P&egrave;re Norbert d'Elbecque at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1698, in six folio volumes, the first of which contains the life of Sylvius. This edition was reproduced at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1726; it is the best, though the editor omitted the works of Sylvius against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>.
