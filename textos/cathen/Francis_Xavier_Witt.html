<h1>Francis Xavier Witt</h1>  

<p>Reformer of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>, founder of the St. Cecilia Society for German-speaking countries, and composer, b. at Walderbach, Upper Palatinate, 9 Feb., 1834; d. at Landshut, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 2 Dec., 1888. The son of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> teacher, Witt was instructed in singing and piano and violin playing from his earliest youth, and when he entered upon his Classical studies at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> he became a member of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir under the direction of Joseph Schrems, through whose masterful interpretations of the long neglected sixteenth-century composers, <a href="../cathen/12486a.htm">Dr. Proske's</a> reform <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were beginning to be put into practice. Witt's unusual musical gifts enabled him to grasp and remember every composition performed by the choir, and his musical development received from his <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a>, philosophic, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies a solid foundation. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 11 June, 1856, for the next three years he was assistant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in Oberschneiding. Although so <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that for a time he thought seriously of becoming a missionary, he continued the study of music in all its branches, and acquired the remarkable technical, historical, and &aelig;sthetic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and equipment so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his future work. On 17 Aug., 1859, he was called to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> as teacher of <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a>, homiletics, and catechetics. After three years he applied for the position of director of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary and choirmaster at the Church of St. Emmeran in <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. On 1 Jan., 1866, appeared the first number of his papers, "Fliegende Blatter fur Kirchenmusik", for teachers, organists, and choirmasters, founded, according to his own words, to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon existing conditions in <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>. The journal met with immediate success, and continues its mission to this day. He also served the cause of reform with great effect as a forceful speaker and as a composer. On 1 Jan., 1868, he began the publication of "Musica Sacra", a complement to "Fliegende Blatter", for the adequate treatment of all questions regarding the relation of music to the liturgy. During the same year, at the general diet of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> held at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, Witt founded the St. Cecilia Society for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. At the request of twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was approved and given a cardinal protector by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1870. Witt served as its president for twenty years. In 1873 he became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Schatzhofen, but, two years later, failing health forced him to retire to Landshut, where he spent the last ten years of his life without pastoral charge. Father Witt united practically all the requisites of a successful reformer. Indomitable energy and a highly artistic temperament were made to serve the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> who realized the harm which was being done to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> by unworthy music. With his vigorous pen and spoken word he urged upon church musicians, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> the moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of obeying the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a return to the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> as the basis and informing principle of all music for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use. His reform <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, propagated through the St. Cecilia Society with its 14,000 members, several music <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a large number of journals devoted to the cause, have not only transformed musical conditions in the countries where they were put forth, but have had an echo throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. As a composer Witt created a style entirely his own. Virility in his melodic material, vivid and striking declamation of the text, masterful <a href="../cathen/04436a.htm">contrapuntal</a> construction, spontaneity, and organic cohesion are some of the characteristics of his works. He wrote more than twenty masses for different combinations of voices, some with <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, some with orchestra accompaniment, and others a cappella, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a>, covering practically the whole <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year, and a large number of other compositions, most of which are standard and included in the repertoire of the best choirs throughout the world.
