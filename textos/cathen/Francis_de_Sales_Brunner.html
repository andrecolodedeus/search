<h1>Francis de Sales Brunner</h1>  

<p>The founder of the Swiss-American congregation of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, b. 10 January, 1795, at Muemliswil, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; d. at the Convent of Schellenberg, Duchy of Lichtenstein, 29 December, 1859. He received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the name of Nicolaus Joseph. After the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he entered, 11July, 1812, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near his residence in Maria Stein. He made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> two years later and studied for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Abbot Pfluger. Ten years after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (1819) he felt a vocation for a stricter life and joined the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> of Oehlemberg, also near his home. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> being suppressed, he offered his services for foreign missions to <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, and was to have gone as Apostolic missionary to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but shortly before the time set for his departure the order was recalled. Next he founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for poor boys in the castle of L&ouml;wenberg, which he had purchased from the Count de Montfort. In 1833 with his mother he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they were both enrolled in the <a href="../cathen/12373b.htm">Archconfraternity of the Most Precious Blood</a>. Returned to Lowenberg, his mother gathered around her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> virgins to "hold a perpetual (day and night) adoration and dedicate their lives to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and the furnishing of vestments for poor churches".

<p>Thus began the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood; their foundress died in 1836, and the community was brought to America under the second mother superior, Sister Clara, who died in 1876 at Grunewald, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Meanwhile, in 1838, Father Brunner had made a second visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had entered the <a href="../cathen/12373c.htm">Congregation of the Most Precious Blood</a> at <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he returned, continued the work he had previously begun, and also began <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> boys for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, so as to inaugurate a German province of the congregation. The Government interfering more and more with his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he accepted the invitation of <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, brought to him by Monsignor Henni, to establish his community in America. Accompanied by eight <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he landed, 21 December, 1843, at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> and, ascending the Ohio River, arrived at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> on New year's Day. From Cincinnati they proceeded to St. Alphonsus, near Norwalk, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, where the first station was erected. Their missionary circuit included all the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> within a radius of 100 miles; they began to erect <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and entrusted the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to the Sisters of the most Precious Blood, who had followed them on the 22nd of July, 1844. After this Father Brunner made several trips to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the interest of his institution, and it was during the last of these that he died. He was an indefatigable missionary and a very prolific writer on religious subjects. Many of his writings, all of which in German, still await publication.
