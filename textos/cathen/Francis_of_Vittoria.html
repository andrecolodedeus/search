<h1>Francis of Vittoria</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; b. about 1480, at Vittoria, province of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>; d. 12 August, 1546. While still young, he moved with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from their native city to <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, at that time the ordinary sojourn of the sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of that place, and, on the completion of his academic studies, entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. While he devoted his energies to the study of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, the mastery of which made him an ornament to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to his order, and to the Universities of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he was assiduous in the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. James in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> then the chief house of studies of the order and affiliated with the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, where he made the best use of the advantages held out to him for the prosecution of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. In 1516, he was appointed to teach in this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and it was here, in all probability that he had for his pupil <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Dominic de Soto</a>. In 1522, he returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> College of St. Gregory at Valladolid till 1524, when he was appointed to the principal chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> which he held till 1544. The influence which Francis exerted directly in the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> and indirectly in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Alcal&aacute;, <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, Vailadolid, and others, forms an interesting chapter in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. More than any other then <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of his time, he ministered to the actual <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> had lost its former prestige, and was passing through the most critical period in its history. The times had changed, and it required a master to adapt speculative thought to the new condition. The revival of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> activity in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of this period, consequent upon the doctrines of the reformers, and the development of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculation inspired Francis to inaugurate a movement for the restoration of scholastic philosophy, and to give to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> a purer diction and an improved literary form. With foresight and ability he devoted all his energies to the undertaking, and his success is attested by the many excellent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works that were produced in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> during the sixteenth century. Among his disciples were Melchior Cano, Bartholomew Medina, <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Dominic de Soto</a>, and Martin de Ledesma, by whose efforts and that of the great <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> teachers a new zest was given to the study of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and by whose aid Francis was able to extend his influence to the other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He is justly styled the father of the Salmantacensis School, and especially of the new <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. His style, simple and unrhetorical, is the more noteworthy for having attained its simplicity in the golden age of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. He left a large number of valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, but his only published work is the "Relectiones XII Theologicae in duo libros distinctae" (Antwerp, 1604). The most important of his unpublished works is his "commentaria in universam summam S. Thomae".
