<h1>Franciscan Crown</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> Seraphic Rosary.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> consisting of seven decades in commemoration of the seven joys of the Blessed Virgin (the Annunciation, Visitation, Birth of our Lord, Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, Finding of the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the Temple, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Our Lord</a>, and the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin and her Coronation in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>), in use among the members of the three orders of St. Francis.

<p>The Franciscan Crown dates back to the year 1422. <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> tells us that a young <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> who had that year been received into the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> had, previous to his reception, been accustomed to adorn a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> with a wreath of fresh and beautiful flowers as a mark of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and devotion. Not being able to continue this practice in the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, he decided to return to the world. The Blessed Virgin appeared to him and prevented him from carrying out his purpose. She then instructed him how, by reciting daily a <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> of seven decades in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of her seven joys, he might weave a crown that would be more pleasing to her than the material wreath of flowers he had been wont to place on her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. From that time the practice of reciting the crown of the seven joys became general in the order.

<p>The manner of reciting the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rosary is as follows: The <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, and three Hail Marys having been said as usual, the mystery to be meditated upon is introduced after the word <em>Jesus</em> of the first Hail Mary of each decade, thus: "Jesus, whom thou didst joyfully conceive", "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom thou didst joyfully carry to Elizabeth", and so on for the remaining five decades, which are given in most manuals of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> devotion. At the end of the seventh decade two Hail Marys are added to complete the number of years (72) that the Blessed Virgin is said to have lived on earth.

<p>There are other ways of reciting the Crown but the one given seems to be in more general use. The plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> attached to the recitation of the Franciscan Crown, and applicable to the dead, may be gained as often as the crown is recited.

<p>It is not required that the beads be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>, or in fact that beads be used at all, since the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> is not attached to the material <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>, but to the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as such. In 1905 <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>, in response to the petition of the Procurator General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, enriched the Franciscan Crown with several new <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> that may be gained by all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Those who assist at a public recitation of the Franciscan Crown participate in all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> attached to the Seraphic Rosary that are gained by the members of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. It is required, however, that beads be used and that they be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having the proper faculties. A translation of the pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> is given in "St. Anthony's Almanac" for 1909.
