<h1>Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, b. 17 Sept., 1785, at Lagos in the state of Jalisco, Mexico; d. 30 April, 1846, at Santa Barbara. In 1801 he received the habit of St. Francis at the missionary college of Guadalupe, <a href="../cathen/15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a>, made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> the following year and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Monterey, Nuevo Leon, 13 Nov., 1808. For the next twenty years Father Diego was mainly occupied in preaching missions, and during this period compiled a small work, "Metodo de Misionar", or "Method for Giving Missions". From 1816 to 1819 he was master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, in 1822 he was made discretos, and in February, 1832, guardian or superior of the missionary college of Guadalupe. At the request of the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government, which had resolved to expel all Spanish <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> from <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, the college, whose members were natives, in April, 1832, sent eleven Mexican <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, Father Diego going as commissary. They reached Cape San Lucas in September 1832, and Monterey, the head-quarters, in February 1833. The Guadalupan <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> took charge of the missions from <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> to Sonoma, and on 6 March, Father Diego chose Santa Clara for his field of labor. He remained here until the end of 1835, when he visited Mexico to induce the Government to have a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed, in order to preserve the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. On 19 Sept., 1836, the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government decided to petition the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to create <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and congress at the same time decreed to pay the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> an annual salary of $6,000 until the diocese should have a sufficient income. Of the three candidates proposed by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter on 22 June, 1839, the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government 6 April, 1840, recommended Father Francisco Garcia Diego.

<p>On 27 April <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> withdrew <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a>, and at the same time appointed Father Diego first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Upper and Lower California with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at San Diego. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church of Guadalupe, <a href="../cathen/15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a>, on 4 October, 1840, and on 11 Dec., 1841, landed at San Diego. Owing to the poverty and insignificance of the place, he removed his residence to Santa Barbara on 11 Jan., 1842. When he arrived, there were only seventeen <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers, mostly aged and infirm, in charge of the twenty-one secularized Indian missions and six Spanish towns. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> began with great plans and a sincere desire to promote the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in his territory. The <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government had encouraged him by giving him a fixed salary, and entrusting to him the management of the famous "Pious Fund", but in February, 1842, President Santa Anna confiscated the Fund. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received no aid whatever, so that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to depend upon the contributions from the few white settlers in the territory, many of whom refused to pay the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which he had found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to impose. Nevertheless he opened the first <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> on the Pacific coast at the former mission of Santa Inez, about fifteen miles from the ocean and forty-five miles from Santa Barbara, made one visitation of all the churches in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to some places even went a second time. Worn out by hardships and disheartened at the deplorable conditions which he could not remedy, Bishop Diego died, and was buried in the old Mission Santa Barbara.
