<h1>Francisco Garc&iacute;a de la Rosa Figueroa</h1>  

<p>Franciscan, b. in the latter part of the eighteenth century at Toluca, in the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Archdiocese of Mexico</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of death unknown. Figueroa possessed extraordinary administrative powers and for more than forty years directed the affairs of his order with singular <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and ability, being <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> emeritus of his order, prefect of studies of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Tlaltelulco, superior of general <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, definitor, custodian, twice <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the province of Santo Evangelio, and visitor to the other provinces of New-Spain. He was much beloved by the people and highly esteemed by the viceroys and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. On 21 Feb., 1790, a royal order was received directing that all documents shedding light on the history of New Spain should be copied and sent to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the order designating in some instances special documents which were wanted. D. Juan Vincente de Guemes Pacheco de Padilla, second Count of Revillagigedo, viceroy from 1789 to 1794, entrusted to Father Figueroa the work od selecting, arranging, and copying these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. To this task Father Figueroa brought such marvellous activity and rare judgment, both in selecting the material and the copyists, that in less than three years he turned over to the Government thirty-two folio volumes of almost a thousand pages each, in duplicate, containing copies of original documents collected from the archives of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and private collections, for the most part almost forgotten, and of greatest value for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of political and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of the provinces. Such a collection contained quite inevitably some material not of the first importance; there were documents of all kinds, but the collection as a whole was one of great value. One copy, which was sent to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and examined by the chronicler <a href="../cathen/03209a.htm">Mu&ntilde;oz</a>, is preserved in the Academia de Historia; the other was kept in Mexico in the Secretar&iacute;a del Virreinado, and from there was transferred to the general archives of the Palacio Nacional where it is still kept. The first volume of this was missing, but about 1872 a copy of it was made from that preserved in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. To the original thirty-two volumes another was added, compiled years afterwards by some <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, which contains a minute index of the contents of the work. Two other copies of the thirty-two volumes were found; one is in Mexico, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of Senor Agueda, and the other in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in the H.H. Bancroft collection.

Thirty fragments from the Museo de Boturini, among them four letters from Father Salvatierra. II. Treatise on political virtues by D. Carlos Sig&uuml;enza; life and martyrdom of the children of <a href="../cathen/14747c.htm">Tlaxcala</a>; narrative of Mexico by Father Geronimo Salmeron, Father Velez, and others. III.
