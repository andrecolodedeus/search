<h1>Francisco Gomes De Amorim</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> poet, dramatist, and novelist; b. at Avelomar, near <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, 13 August, 1827; d. 4 November, 1891. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were respectable but so <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> that Francisco had to leave <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at the age of ten, when he went to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> and obtained a situation in a business house at Para. After some time he found an opportunity to study the manners and dialects of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> of the Amazon forests. He returned to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in his twentieth year, and two years later under the influence of the revolutionary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of 1848, he composed the poems "A liberdade", "A queda da Hungria" and "Garibaldi". Sympathizing as he did with the principles of romanticism, he, like so many other young writers, fell under the spell of <a href="../cathen/01327a.htm">Almeida</a> Garrett, and, to help him to carry out his plan of establishing a national drama, he began to write plays. The first, "Ghigi" (1852), was performed at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> with signal success. It was followed by a long series of dramas, among which the best known are, "Odio de ra&ccedil;a", "Aleij&otilde;es sociaes", "Figados de tigre," "A prohibi&ccedil;&atilde;o", "A viuva", "A abnega&ccedil;&atilde;o", and "Os herdeiros do millionario". For several years prior to 1851, in order to make a living, he worked in a hatter's establishment, but in that year he was appointed to a government post, and found leisure to compose his dramas, poems, and romances. In 1859 he was made librarian to the Minister of Marine.

<p>His Iyric fame was firmly fixed by the appearance in 1858 of two collections of poems, the "Cantos matutinos" and the "Ephemeros". As a novelist, he made himself favourably known by "Os selvagens" (1875) and its sequel "O remorso vivo" (1876), by the "Amor da patria" (1879), which is partly an historical novel and partly a romance of the sea, by the "Muita parra e poca uva" (1879) and by many others. In some of the novels, as in several of the plays, he draws upon his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> life. His admiration for his friend, Almeida Garret, who had constantly encouraged him in his literary endeavours, led him to compose his great work, "Garret, Memorias biographicas" (Lisbon, 1881), which not only deals with the public and private life of the greatest modern poet and orator of the country, but is also a history of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> from 1799 till 1854.
