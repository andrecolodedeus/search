<h1>Francisco Herrera</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Francisco Herrera (el Viejo, the Elder)</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, etcher, medallist, and architect; born in <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 1576; died in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1656. Luiz Fernandez was his teacher, but Herrera soon broke away from the timid style and Italian traditions of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of his day, and became the pioneer of that bold, vigourous, effective, and natural style whose preeminent exponent was <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>. Herrera was the first to use long brushes, which may, in part, account for his "modern" technique and dexterous brushwork. Many authorities ascribe to him the foundation of the Spanish School. His great talent brought him many pupils, whom his passionate temper and rough manners soon drove away. <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>, when thirteen years old, was placed under this great professor, and remained a year with him. Herrera, who was an accomplished worker in bronze, engraved medals skilfully. This gave rise to the charge of counterfeiting, and he fled for sanctuary to the Jesuit College, for which he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> "The Triumph of St. Hermengild", a picture so impressive that when Philip IV saw it (1621) he immediately pardoned the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. Herrera thereupon returned to Seville. His ungoverned temper soon drove his son to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and his daughter to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a>. Herrera's pictures are full of energy, the drawing is good and the colouring so cleverly managed that the figures stand out in splendid relief. Many of his small easel pictures, in oil, represent fairs, dances, interiors of inns, and deal with the intimate life of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. His large works are nearly all religious. In Seville he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a "St. Peter" for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and a "Last Judgment" for the church of San Bernardo, the latter being considered his masterpiece. After executing many commissions in his native town he removed to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1650), where he won great renown. In the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace are four large canvases, one of which, "Moses Smiting the Rock", is celebrated for its dramatic qualities and daring technique. In the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the Merced Calzada is a noteworthy series of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> whose subjects are drawn from the life of St. Ramon. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> much in fresco, in which medium his best effort is believed to have been on the vault of San Bonaventura, but this, with all his other frescoes, has disappeared. None of his <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> productions are mentioned, and there remain but a few of his etchings, all of which were reproductions of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. One of his pictures, "St. Basil dictating his doctrine", is in the Louvre, and another, "St. Matthew", is in the Dresden Gallery. Herrera left two sons, "el Rubio" (the ruddy) who died before he fulfilled the great promise of his youth, and "el Mozo" (the younger).
<h2 id="section2">Francisco Herrera (el Mozo, the Younger)</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and architect; born in <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 1622; died in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1655. He was the second son of Herrera, "el Viejo", and began his career under his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> instruction, but the elder's violent temper at last became so intolerable that the youth fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For six years the younger Herrera assiduously devoted himself to the study of architecture, perspective, and the antique, his aim being fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. But it was still life in which he excelled. He already <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> <em>bodegones</em>, fish so cleverly done that the Romans called him: "il Spagnuolo degli pesci". In 1656 he returned to <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, founded the Seville Academy, and in 1660 became its sub-director under <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>. He is said to have been vain, suspicious, hot-tempered, and jealous; at any rate he resented his subordinate post and went to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> about 1661 (Cean Berm&uacute;dez). Before leaving his native city he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> two large pictures for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and a "St. Francis" for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of this saint. Sir E. Head declares the latter to be his masterpiece. In <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a great "Triumph of <a href="../cathen/07276a.htm">St. Hermengild</a>" for the church of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, and so beautiful a group of frescoes in San Felipe el Real that Philip IV commanded him to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Our Lady of Atocha, and thereafter made him <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to the king and superintendent of royal buildings. Besides his marvellous work in still life he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> many portraits, and while these lacked the vigour, colour, and bold design which characterize his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> work, they exhibit a far greater <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and use of chiaroscuro. Charles II kept him at his Court and made him master of the royal works. For this king Herrera renovated the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of El Pilar, in <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> gallery contains his "St. Hermengild".
