<h1>Francisco Lopez de G&oacute;mara</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> GOMORA.)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1510; studied at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, made a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and upon his return in 1540, entered the service of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hern&aacute;ndo Cort&eacute;s</a> as private and domestic <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. He accompanied <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> on the Algerian expedition and, after the death of his patron, it is known that he was at Valladolid in 1556 or 1557, after which he is supposed to have retired to his native city of Seville where he probably died. With the information given him by the conqueror and other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had returned from the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> (he himself cites Gonzalo de Tapia and Gonzalo de Umbria) he wrote his "Hispania Victrix; First and Second Parts of the General History of the Indies, with the whole discovery and notable things that have happened since they were acquired until the year 1551, with the conquest of Mexico and New Spain", a work published at Saragossa in the year 1552. It was translated into French by Martin Fum&eacute;e and published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1578; Augustin Gravaliz translated it into Italian and published it at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1560; lastly, <a href="../cathen/03663a.htm">Juan Bautista de San Anton Chimalpain Quanhalehuatzin</a> translated it into Mexican. The author relates in the first part, which is dedicated "To Don Carlos, Emperor of Romans, King of Spain, Lord of the Indies and New World", the whole discovery and conquest of the Antilles, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> (up to the pacification effected by Gasca), <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> and Central America, also the voyage of <a href="../cathen/09526b.htm">Magellan</a> and the discovery of the Moluccas. In the second part he tells of the conquest of Mexico, and it is dedicated "To the very illustrious Lord Don Martin Cort&eacute;s, Marques del Valle" &#151; the son and heir of the conqueror.

<p>Whether through the desire to aggrandize his patron, or through relying on the first-hand information which the latter gave him (it is to be noted that G&oacute;mara was never in America) or from malice, or for some other reason G&oacute;mara fell into serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and in many instances <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> gravely against historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It was perhaps for this reason that Prince Philip (afterwards Philip II), in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> issued at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, 17 November, 1553, ordered all the copies of his work that could be found to be gathered in and imposed a penalty of 200,000 maravedis on anyone who should reprint it. This prohibition was removed in 1727 through the efforts of Don Andreas Gonzalez Martial who included G&oacute;mara's work in his collection of early historians of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> (Coleccion de historiadores primitivos de las Indias Occidentales). The "Verdadera historia de la Conquesta de Nueva Espana" (True History of the Conquest of New Spain) of Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo, a companion of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hernando Cortes</a>, was written to refute G&oacute;mara. The latter's style is concise and agreeable, the narrative running on rapidly and gracefully, all of which has had the effect of attracting readers to the work. Among other works of his which have remained unpublished are "Batallas de mar de nuestros tiempos" (Contemporary Naval Battles) and "Historia de Harrue y Harradin Barbarroja".
