<h1>Francisco Nicol&aacute;s Borras</h1>  

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born at Cocentaina, 1530; died at Gandia, 1610. Going to Valencia at an early age to study under Vicente Joanes, he became that master's most noteworthy pupil. His works in general resemble those of Joanes and some of them are good enough to have been taken for the master's. Entering the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he was assigned to his native place, where he devoted all his spare moments to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and acquired such skill that the authorities of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, at Gandia, employed him to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the picture for the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of their church. He enjoyed his stay at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> so much, that taking a great liking to the brothers and their life he determined to ask for no other payment for his work than membership in the order. He received the habit in 1575, and took the final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> the following year. Three years thereafter, Fra Nicol&aacute;s, in search, perhaps, of an even more austere life, spent some little time with the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de la Riviera near Valencia. He was soon back, however, at Gandia where he passed the rest of his life <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in every part of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, chief <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a>, <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, refectories, and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, leaving twelve altar pieces in the church alone. He also spent his own money in the employment of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> and builders for the embellishment of his beloved <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.

<p>Besides his great labours at Gandia Borras also did much work for churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, at the capital, and elsewhere. His <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> appeared at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Valencia and at the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the city of San Miguel de los Reyes where there was a "Christ at the Column", and a picture of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in adoration of "The Holy Virgin". Others were at his native place in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen, in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> at Aldaya, and at Ontiniente. In the Museum at Valencia there are some fifty <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Borras chiefly from Gandia and San Miguel. Among them are "The Last Supper", "Christ Bearing His Cross", "The Dead Saviour in the Arms of the Eternal Father", and "The Archangel Michael Driving Souls into Purgatory and Hell". In the last Borras is supposed to have pictured himself as a white robed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> kneeling on the brink.
