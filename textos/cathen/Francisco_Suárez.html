<h1>Francisco Su&aacute;rez</h1>  

<p><em>Doctor Eximius</em>, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> called him, born at <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, 5 January, 1548; died at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 25 September, 1617. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Salamanca, 16 June, 1564; in that city he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> from 1565 to 1570, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1572. He taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a> (1571), and later, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> and Segovia (1575), Valladolid (1576), <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1580-85); Alcal&aacute; (1585-92), Salamanca (1592-97), and Coimbra (1597-1616). All his biographers say that he was an excellent religious, practicing <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, laborious, modest, and given to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. He enjoyed such fame for wisdom that <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> attended his first lecture in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> invited him to refute the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of King James of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and wished to retain him near his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, to profit by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; Philip II sent him to the <a href="../cathen/04095c.htm">University of Coimbra</a> to give prestige to that institution, and when Francisco Su&aacute;rez visited the <a href="../cathen/02290a.htm">University of Barcelona</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> went out to meet him, with the insignia of their faculties. His writings are characterized by depth, penetration and clearness of expression, and they bear witness to their author's exceptional <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Fathers, and of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> as well as of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> said that the writings of Francisco Su&aacute;rez contained the whole of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>; Werner (Franz Francisco Su&aacute;rez, p. 90) affirms that if Francisco Su&aacute;rez be not the first <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of his age, he is, beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, among the first; Grotius (Ep. 154, J. Cordesio) recognizes in him one of the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and a profound <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and Mackintosh considers him one of the founders of <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, he founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of his own, "Suarism", the chief characteristic principles of which are: <ol><li>the principle of individuation by the proper concrete entity of beings; <li>the pure potentiality of matter; <li>the singular as the object of direct <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> cognition; <li>a nonconceptual distinction between the essence and the existence of created beings; <li>the possibility of spiritual substance only numerically distinct from one another; <li>ambition for the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">fallen angels</a>; <li>the Incarnation of the Word, even if Adam had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; <li>the solemnity of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> only in ecclesiastical law; <li>the system of Congruism that modifies <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinism</a> by the introduction of subjective circumstances, as well as of place and of time, propitious to the action of efficacious grace, and with <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> <em>ante praevisa merita</em>; <li>possibility of holding one and the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by both <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in Divine authority contained in an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <li>production of the body and blood of Christ by <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> as constituting the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Eucharistic sacrifice</a>; <li>the final grace of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> Mary superior to that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> combined.</ol>

<p>"Su&aacute;rez classes" were established in several <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>--Valladolid, Salamanca (1720), Alcal&aacute; (1734)--and various <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> authors wrote their works <em>ad mentem S&aacute;ii</em>. Charles III suppressed those classes throughout his dominions by a royal decree of 12 August, 1768, and prohibited the use of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> authors, and therefore of Francisco Su&aacute;rez, in teaching. It is obvious, says Cardinal Gonzalez, that, in so many volumes written by Francisco Su&aacute;rez, there are to be found some matters of little utility, or the practical or scientific importance of which are not in proportion to the time and space that Francisco Su&aacute;rez devotes to them. He is also charged with being somewhat diffuse. His book "De Defensione Fidei" was burned at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by royal command, and was prohibited by the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1614) on the ground that it contained doctrines that were contrary to the power of sovereigns.
<h2>Works</h2>

<p>Su&aacute;rez published his first work, "De Deo Incarnato", at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, in 1590; he published twelve other volumes, the last of which, "De Defensio Fidei," written against the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was published at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, in 1613. After his death the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> published ten other volumes of his work, between 1619 and 1655. Of all of these works, two different editions were made; the first, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 23 volumes in folio (1740-1757); and the second in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (Vives), 28 volumes (1856-1861). In 1859 Mgr Manlou published another volume in folio, containing six short treatises that had not been previously published. Father De Scorraille (Etudes, Vol. LXIV, pp. 151-175) gave an account of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Francisco Su&aacute;rez, noting the fact that they were numerous and that he himself possessed seventy-five of them. Many of these and others besides were found by Father Rivi&egrave;re. The works of Francisco Su&aacute;rez were held in the highest esteem in his day, as is shown by the numerous partial editions that were made of them (Lyons, Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, Mayence, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>), as also by the fact, related by his biographies, that one of the wings of the old college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Salamanca was restored with the product of the sale of his metaphysical works. A compendium of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of Francisco Su&aacute;rez was published by Father Noel, S.J. (Madrid, 1732); a short epitome of this <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputes, by the Portuguese Father Francis So&aacute;rez, S.J. (Lisbon, 1626), and a compendium of the <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, by Father Gregorio Iturria, S.J. (Madrid, 1901).
