<h1>Francisco Zurbaran</h1>  

<p>Born in the suburb of Fuente de Cantos in Estramadure, on the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, Nov., 1598; died probably at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> about 1662. From his early years he showed great aptitude for drawing. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, honest peasants, placed no obstacle to his artistic tastes. While a young boy he frequented the studio of Juan de las Roclas, of whom he became a favourite pupil. It has been claimed that he made the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but there is no evidence of his having done so. In 1616, at the age of eighteen, he signed an Immaculate Conception. This is the only picture of his youth; but it has not been preserved, and we do not find another work of his until 1625. The Marquess de Malagan commissioned him to decorate the retable of San Pedro in the Cathedral at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>; even in this early work the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> brilliantly displays his powerful and very individual manner. After the retable of San Pedro he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Mercenarious Descalozos, which was then recently built at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, five or six of the twelve pictures which recount the life of <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a>, founder of the Order of Mercy. The others are by his pupil Juan Martinez de Gradillas. The museum of the Prado at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> contains two of Zurbaran's pictures: the Vision of <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> and the Apparition of the crucified Prince of the Apostles to <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a>. These two canvases are remarkable for their serenity, strength, and nobility. Zurbaran's vigorous manner, which aimed at fidelity of expression, appear here in bold relief. The success of these pictures at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Mercenarios was such that the ayutamiento of Seville begged the artist to fix his residence in the capital of <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>. It is said that <a href="../cathen/03250d.htm">Alonso Cano</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> protested, demanding that Zurbaran should be subjected to a preliminary examination according to custom. The latter haughtily retorted by requesting the municipality to declare that the unanimous approval of his works was sufficient evidence of his capacity. Commissions flowed in from all sides. About 1625 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> several canvases in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> in the church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> at Seville: St. Bonaventure presiding at the chapter of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>; the Burial of St. Bonaventure (now at the Louvre); St. Bonaventure visited by an Angel (Dresden); and St. Bonaventure showing the crucifix to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (Berlin). About the same period he began to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the Apotheosis of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the college which bore his name. This is the finest of his most beautiful works, and it is certainly one of the highest and noblest productions of the Spanish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. It was finished in 1636; it is now at the provincial museum of Seville. In the same year Zurbaran produced another masterpiece, Bl. Alonso Rodriguez (Academy of San Fernando, Seville). Between 1633 and 1638 he executed for the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Xeres a large number of pictures drawn from the Gospels and the life of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, which formed a splendid assemblage; they are now scattered (Provincial Museum of <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>, has <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, etc.; the Departmental Museum of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, possesses the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>). In the centre of a chain of mountains covered with oaks and chestnuts which separate Estramadura from <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, on a peak less sharp than its neighbours, rises the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07043a.htm">Guadalupe</a>. Belonging to the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Order of Hieronymites</a> this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was for a long time the centre of a much frequented <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, whither people came to venerate a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> which St. Leander, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, had brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the church of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, almost inaccessible is hidden what is "perhaps Zurbaran's most important work" (Lafond, "Ribera et Zurbaran", 100). It consists of thirteen pictures. Two, representing St. Ildefonso and <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas of Bari</a>, adorn the side altars at the entrance to the choir. The others relate to the life of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. The pictures of Guadalupe mark the culminating point of Zurbaran's career. Thenceforth his activity slackened, but still produced masterpieces. About 1650 the Marquess de Campo Alanza commissioned him to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Castellon the series of great founders of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders from Elias to <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>. These pictures are still in the same place. Zurbaran also composed a very beautiful collection of full length portraits of <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; these are now scattered (San Fernando Academy, Museum of Pau, Stafford House, residence of the Duke of Sutherland, London). Besides these pictures Zurbaran <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a great many pictures of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; one of the most striking is the "Kneeling Monk" at the National Gallery. At the instance of <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a>, who had been Zurbaran's comrade at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, Philip IV invited Zurbaran to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1650 and commissioned him to take part in the decorations of the hall of Buen Ratio. His share consisted in representing the "labours of Hercules" in ten pictures; his thoroughly religious talent was but little adapted to mythological conceptions, and after having <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> three or four canvases he merely sketched the others, which were completed by his pupils (1658). However, these naked figures are remarkable for correctness of drawing and powerful appearance. In 1659 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> kneeling (property of Don A. de Beruete). The museum at Buda-Pesth has an Immaculate Conception <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1661, a year before his death. Mention may be made of many other of his works, e.g. Christ Crowning St. Joseph (Seville), the Portiuncula (Cadiz), the Blessed Virgin and St. John on Calvary (Munich), a St. Francis of Assisi (Dresden), a St. Lawrence (St. Petersburg), an Adoration of the Shepherds (National Gallery), long attributed to <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a>, but now commonly restored to Zurbaran.
