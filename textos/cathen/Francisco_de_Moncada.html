<h1>Francisco de Moncada</h1>  

<p>Count of Osona, Spanish historian, son of the Governor of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and Catalonia, born at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, 29 December, 1586; died near Goch, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 1635. He entered the army at a very early age, and in 1624, was appointed by King Philip IV ambassador to the imperial court at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he soon succeeded in acquiring the esteem of Ferdinand II and his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. In 1629 he was recalled from <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and sent to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in place of Cardinal de la Cueva, ambassador to the Infanta Isabella. His chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> there consisted in keeping the king posted in regard to the conditions in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, in supervising the royal officials, and in watching over the disbursements of Spanish funds. He soon discovered the chief fault of the preceding administration and endeavoured to concede to the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a> a much larger share in the administration of their country's affairs, for he realized that only by such a show of confidence could they be kept loyal to the empire. He also proposed, though without success, to transfer the general management of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> affairs from <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. In 1630 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the navy, in 1632 of the entire army, and in 1634, after the death of the Infanta, governor of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, until relieved by the arrival of Prince Cardinal Ferdinand. His crowning and final achievement as military commander was the liberation of <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Breda</a>, the citizens of which ordered memorial <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> struck in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The following year he accompanied the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on an expedition into the Duchy of Cleves, where he died after a short illness at the siege of Goch. He had an amiable character, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to guide men according to his own desires, and combined great shrewdness and firmness with wise moderation. He wrote a valuable history of the expedition of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Catalonians and Aragonians</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and Greeks (Barcelona, 1623; Madrid, 1777, 1805, 1883; Paris, 1841, in "Tesoro de los historiadores espanoles"). We furthermore possess from his pen the "Vida de Anicio Manlio Torquato Severino Boecio", which was printed (Frankfort 1642) seven years after his death.
