<h1>Francisco de Vargas y Mexia</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> diplomat and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, b. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; d. At the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of la Cisla in 1566. He belonged to an old <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the lower nobility and studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>, receiving the degree of licentiate in law. He became a government official, and by his energy and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, especially by his excellent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of law, rose to the position of fiscal of the Council of Castile (<em>Fiscal del Consejos de Castilla</em>), that is, attorney-general. In 1545 <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> sent him to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. In January, 1548, he protested, as Charles's representative at the council, against its transfer to Bologna, and in 1551 he congratulated the council on its return to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. During the years 1552-59 he was the Spanish ambassador at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; in 1558 he negotiated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> regarding the recognition of Ferdinand I as emperor, and in references to the founding of new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. From 1559 he succeeded Gigueroa as the Spanish ambassador to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. As such he took an important part in the election of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. When <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> brought suit against the relatives of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, Vargas exerted himself to save the Caraffa. For some time was not regarded favorably by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who tried to have him recalled by spain; however, Vargas again obtained the confidence of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and was commissioned by the latter in 1563 to prepare an opinion on the question of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as to which the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had become involved in a dispute. The document Vargas prepared was published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the same year under the title of "De episcoporum jurisdictione et de pontificis maximi auctoritate responsum". In this Vargas speaks as a strict supporter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question that he took up was that of granting the cup to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; to this he was decidedly opposed. His reports and letters are important for the information they contain on the doings of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; still, he cannot be regarded as an entirely unprejudiced witness, because his interest was that of a diplomat in the service of his king. His keen powers of observation were also chiefly directed to the scrutiny of earthly motives, and of the evidence of human weaknesses and shortsightedness. He was prominent in the affairs of the council for the last time when, in conjunction with the Spanish ambassador at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, he tried to postpone the close of the council. After his return to spain he was made state councillor, but soon resigned all his offices and retired to the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of la Cisla near Toledo, in order to prepare himself for death. His contemporaries praise him as a highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> man and a patron of learning. He as also a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, skilful, and conscientious servant of his king and a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.
