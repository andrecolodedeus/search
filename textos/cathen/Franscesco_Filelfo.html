<h1>Franscesco Filelfo</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Tolentino</a>, 25 July, 1398; d. at Florence 31 July, 1481. He studied grammar, rhetoric, and <a href="../cathen/09032a.htm">Latin literature</a> at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where he was appointed professor at the age of eighteen. In 1417 he was invited to teach eloquence and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> citizenship were conferred upon him. Two years later he was appointed secretary tot he <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> consul-general at Constantinople. Arriving there in 1420, he at once began the study of Greek under John Chrysoloras, whose daughter he afterwards married, and he was received with great favour by the Emperor John Palaeologus, by whom he was employed on several important diplomatic missions. In 1427, receiving an invitation to the chair of eloquence at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Filelfo returned there with a great collection of Greek books. The following year he was called to Bologna and in 1429 to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he was received with the greatest enthusiasm. During his five years residence there he engaged in numerous quarrels with the Florentine scholars and incurred the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>, so that in 1434 he was forced to leave the city. He went to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and later to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he was welcomed by Filippo Maria Visconti, who showered <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> upon him. Some years later, after <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> had been forcibly entered by Francesco Storza, Filelfo wrote a history of Storza's life in a Latin epic poem of sixteen books, called the "Storziad". In 1474 he left <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to accept a professorship at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, owing to a disagreement with <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, he did not remain long. He went back to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but left there in 1481 to teach Greek at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, having long before become reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>. He died in poverty only a fortnight after his arrival. The Florentines <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> him in the church of the Annunziata. Filelfo was the most restless of all the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, as is indicated by the number of places at which he taught. He was a man of indefatigable activity but arrogant, rapacious, fond of luxury, and always ready to assail his literary rivals. His writings include numerous letters (last ed. by <a href="../cathen/09133a.htm">Legrand</a>, Paris, 1892), speeches (Paris, 1515), and satires (Venice, 1502); besides many scattered pieces in prose, published under the title "Convivia Mediolanensia", and a great many Latin translations from the Greek. In both these languages he wrote with equal fluency.
