<h1>Franz Christoph Ignaz Moufang</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 17 Feb., 1817; d. there, 27 Feb., 1890. His early studies were made at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. In 1834 he went to the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>, first taking up medicine, but soon turning to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Among his masters were <a href="../cathen/08666a.htm">Klee</a>, Windischmann, and Walter. In 1937 he went to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and then next year took the prescribed <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> examinations at Giessen, after which he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 19 Dec., 1839. His first appointment was as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in Seligenstadt on the Main, where his uncle, <a href="../cathen/09150b.htm">Adam Franz Lennig</a>, later <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. <a href="../cathen/09150b.htm">Lennig</a> stimulated in him a broad interest for the religious questions of the time. Moufang also taught at the pro-gymnasium at Seligenstadt. After brief charges of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Bensheim, and that of St. Quentin in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> he was appointed in 1845 religious instructor at the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> gymnasium.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop von Ketteler</a> re-established in 1851 the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he appointed Moufang regent of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and professor of moral and pastoral theology. Moufang became a canon 6 Nov., 1854, and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a> and member of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> court 2 December of the same year. On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of W&uuml;rzburg bestowed the honorary degree of doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> upon him. On the death of <a href="../cathen/09150b.htm">Lennig</a> in 1866 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wished Moufang to be his successor as dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Moufang, however, declined, preferring to devote himself to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In November, 1868, he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the preparatory work of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and was placed on the committee for ecclesiastico-political matters under <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Cardinal Reisach</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm"><em>Kulturkampf</em></a>, to Moufang's great sorrow, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was closed (1877) by hostile legislation. After the death of <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop von Ketteler</a> (13 July, 1877), the chapter elected Moufang administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The hostile attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government made this office very difficult during the ten years' vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. On 16 April, 1886, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> made him a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Under Bishop Haffner the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was reopened on 25 October, 1887, and Moufang again directed the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> as regent. But ill-health prevented him from remaining long at the work that was so dear to him.

<p>Moufang rendered great and permanent services to the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a> as an educator of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in many other ways. He was soon prominent in the circle that centred about <a href="../cathen/09150b.htm">Lennig's</a> strong, energetic <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, and he took an eager part in all efforts to improve religious and social conditions. He assisted in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/12139a.htm">"Piusverein"</a>, and as a member of the "St. Vincenz-und Elisabeth-Verein" did much to promote its prosperity. In the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> his name is inseparably linked with the history of the general conventions (Generalversammlungen) of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Like his colleague, Heinrich, he was, for almost forty years, one of the leading personalities and most prominent speakers. For a number of years he was also active as a legislator. After 1863, as representative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he had a seat in the upper chamber of the <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hessian</a> Landtag, and repeatedly took a prominent part in the debates on social and political questions, and questions of Church policy. In 1871 he entered the German Reichstag, where he was held in great esteem by the Centre for his political services and as an intermediary in harmonizing the differences between North and South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The most prominent feature of his literary activity was his work in reorganizing and publishing the "Katholik", which in collaboration with Heinrich he edited from 1851 until his death.

<p>His other literary work was mainly in the history of the older <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> catechisms in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. His chief works on this subject are: "Die Mainzer Katechismen von Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts" (Mainz, 1878); "Katholische Katechismen des 16. Jahrhunderts in deutscher Sprache, herausgegeben und mit Anmerkungen verschen" (Mainz, 1881). Among his numerous shorter writings are: "Die barmherzigen Schwestern, eine Darstellung ihrer Gr&uuml;ndung, Verbreitung, Einrichtung und Wirksamkeit" (Mainz, 1842); "Der Informativ-Prozess. Eine kirchenrechtliche Er&ouml;rterung" (Mainz, 1850); "Die katholischen Pfarrschulen in der Stadt Mainz" (Mainz, 1863); "Das Verbot der Ehen zwischen nahen Verwandten. Beleuchtung der Gr&uuml;nde dieses Verbotes" (Mainz, 1863, I; "Die Handwerkerfrage" (Mainz, 1864), a speech delivered in the Upper Chamber of the Landtag at Darmstadt and published with notes; "Die Kirche und die Versammlung katholischer Gelehrten" (Mainz, 1864), a reply to Dr. Michelis's "Kirche oder Partei"; "Cardinal Wiseman und seine Verdienste um die Wissenschaft und die Kirche" (Mainz, 1865); "Der Kampf um Rom und seine Folgen f&uuml;r Italien und die Welt" (Minz, 1868); "Carl August, Cardinal von Reisach", in "Katholic", 1870, I, 129-50; "Der besondere Schutz Gottes &uuml;ber Papst Pius IX" (Mainz, 1871); "Aktenst&uuml;cke betreffend die Jesuiten in Deutschland, gesammelt und mit Erl&auml;uterungen versehen" (Mainz, 1872). Moufang also published a <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayerbook</a>, "Officium divinum", which is very widely used and has passed through numerous editions, the first appearing at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in 1851, the nineteenth in 1905.
