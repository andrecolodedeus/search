<h1>Franz Friedrich Wilhelm von F&uuml;rstenberg</h1>  

<p>A statesman and educator, b. 7 August, 1729, at Herdringen in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; d. 16 September, 1810, at M&uuml;nster. After receiving his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from private tutors, and from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, he attended the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> there, and at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, for the study of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, which he completed at the Sapienza in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1753. In 1748 he had become canon at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of M&uuml;nster and, later, also at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a>, though he had no intention of entering the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. During the Seven Years War (1756-1763) he rendered signal services to his country as intermediary between the opposing camps, and through his influence warded off many a calamity from the city and principality of M&uuml;nster.

<p>After the death of Clemens August, Elector of Cologne and Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, on 6 February, 1761, it was chiefly through the influence of F&uuml;rstenberg that Maximilian Friedrich von Konigseck-Rothenfels, who had succeeded Clemens August at Cologne (6 April, 1761), was also elected Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> in September, 1762. In recognition for these services the new prince-bishop entrusted F&uuml;rstenberg with the temporal and spiritual administration of the Prince-Bishopric of M&uuml;nster. In 1762 he appointed him privy councillor and minister and, in 1770, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and curator of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. No better man could have been found to manage the temporal and spiritual affairs of the Prince-Bishopric of M&uuml;nster which had suffered severely during the Seven Years War. Everybody was deep in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and all trade and commerce was at a standstill. To restore prosperity to the people he improved agricultural conditions by dividing the land into marks, draining marshes and reclaiming much soil which hitherto had lain idle or in pasturage. He ameliorated the condition of the serfs and gave an impulse to the entire abolition of serfdom. In order to liquidate the public <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> he placed a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> on such imported goods as could be easily dispensed with, and for a space of six years levied a moderate capitation tax from which the privileged estates were not exempted. He improved the military and the sanitary system, the former by founding a military academy at M&uuml;nster and by introducing the "Landwehr", the latter by founding a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of medicine (1773) and inducing its director, the learned Christopher Ludwig Hoffmann, to draw up a code of medicinal regulations which was justly admired through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as a model of its kind.

<p>The greatest achievement of F&uuml;rstenberg was his reform of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system. During the latter half of the eighteenth century the higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had become veritable hotbeds of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> and irreligion, and not infrequently pronounced <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinkers</a> were engaged to instruct the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. These conditions were not only permitted but often directly favoured by a few unworthy but influential <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, among whom must be numbered F&uuml;rstenberg's superior Max Friedrich, the elector of Cologne and Prince-Bishop of Muster. To counteract this state of affairs, F&uuml;rstenberg planned a reform of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>. Luckily he was not hampered in this by his superior, the prince-bishop. He began his reform with the gyrnnasium, as the basis of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the future <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whom he considered the chief leader and teacher of the people. After consulting with acknowledged educators, especially the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who then directed the gymnasium of M&uuml;nster, he drew up a tentative plan for the gymnasium in 1770, which, after a few changes, was enforced by his famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> ordinance of 1776. According to the new plan great stress was laid on a thorough training in theoretical and practical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and a course in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy was added to the curriculum. In the same year he turned the recently suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Ueberwasser at M&uuml;nster into a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> where the hitherto neglected candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> could receive the requisite moral training. F&uuml;rstenberg then directed his attention towards the completion of the new <a href="../cathen/10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a> (approved in 1773) where, as an effectual safeguard against <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendencies, he appointed to professorial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> only men who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be firmly grounded in their Faith. To the most talented of these he offered every opportunity to prepare for professorial positions and even gave them the means to pursue special courses at foreign <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>.

<p>F&uuml;rstenberg's political activity came to a close in 1780, when Maximilian Franz, the brother of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, was elected coadjutor to Maximilian Friedrich as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and Prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. F&uuml;rstenberg himself had aspired to this position and undoubtedly would have been elected if it had not been for the great influence of the Court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> which favoured the election of Maximilian Franz. F&uuml;rstenberg was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resign the ministry but was allowed to retain the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and curator of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He now turned his entire attention towards the remodelling of elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Through his ordinances for elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in 1782, 1788, and 1801, he freed the system of elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of at least the most striking abuses. In order to obtain <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and competent teachers he founded a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1783, which he put in charge of the famous educator, Bernard Overberg. After <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had taken possession of M&uuml;nster in 1803, F&uuml;rstenberg's influence over the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system began to decline, and when in 1805 he protested against the appointment of a professor of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a>, he was honourably dismissed as curator of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> on the plea of old age. In 1807 he also resigned the position of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. F&uuml;rstenberg's renown as an educator had drawn some of the greatest minds of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/06367a.htm">Princess Amelia von Gallitzin</a>, in whose return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> from which she had become estranged in her youth, he was greatly instrumental.
