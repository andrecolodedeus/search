<h1>Franz Hunolt</h1>  

<p>The most popular German preacher of the early part of the eighteenth century, b. 31 March, 1691, at Siegen; d. 12 September, 1746, at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. The name of this renowned preacher is spelled in various ways in the catalogues of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> &#151; Humold, Hunoldt, and (usually) Hunolt. At the age of nine years he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of his native town and six years later he attended the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Cologne to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Having completed the three years' course as <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master of arts</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> there on 18 May. After a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of two years at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> he was sent to Geyst (near M&uuml;nster, in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>) for one year to prepare himself to teach. After this he taught in the gymnasium at Cologne and also at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> to the complete satisfaction of his superiors (<em>summ&acirc; cum laude</em>), being at the same time <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of the junior sodality. In this position he showed <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his remarkable oratorical talents. Having completed the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course of four years and received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, he should then have made his tertianship, or third year of probation, but was, during most of that period, employed in giving popular missions, so great had his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as a preacher already become. His next appointment was to the chair of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> at Coblenz, where he made his profession, 15 August, 1724. It was not until after this year that he was able to follow his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vocation; he was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and continued in that employment for nineteen years, to the satisfaction of his superiors, and the spiritual advancement of the city. Besides this he was much sought after as a confessor, and he also became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the city <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. His indefatigable activity required robust health, which, unfortunately, Hunolt had not. Chronic weakness of the heart rendered it impossible for him to preach; consequently, in 1743, he was transferred to the position of master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and died there three years later.

<p>Hunolt's great collection of sermons is still widely used. No fewer than six folio editions of the original work appeared between 1740 and 1813. After the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, versions in more modern German began to be published; one in twenty-five volumes appeared at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1842-47; another modern version appeared about the same time at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a>, in twenty-four volumes. There have been several editions of both the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> version and the Graz, while abridgements and selected sermons have frequently been published, and are frequently republished with much success. Universally esteemed, the work was translated in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, French, and Polish; an English version in twelve volumes was completed in 1898.

<p>Hunolt's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was to treat the entire field of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> thoroughly and completely. Each of the six volumes contains seventy-two sermons, and the various divisions in each volume are indicated by sub-titles, such as "The Christian Attitude towards Life"; "The Wicked Christian"; "The Penitent Christian"; "The Good Christian"; "The Last End of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>"; "The Christian's Model". This prodigious mass of material is distributed most appropriately over the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year. How popular, and at the same time profound, Hunolt's expositions are, is best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fact that numerous excerpts are included in all anthologies and textbooks of religious rhetoric as standard. A competent critic (Kraus) has eulogized Hunolt's sermons in the following words: "At a time when German <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> oratory had degenerated into utter bad taste and brainless insipidity, these sermons are distinguished by noble simplicity, pure <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiment, and genuine apostolic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> no less than by the felicitous use of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, abundance of thought and pregnant language." And finally, we must call attention to the cultural value of Hunolt's work especially for the district of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, inasmuch as we may gather therefrom a fairly correct picture of life in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> of his day.
