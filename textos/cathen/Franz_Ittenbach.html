<h1>Franz Ittenbach</h1>  

<p>Historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>; born at K&ouml;nigswinter, at the foot of the Drachenfels, in 1813; died at D&uuml;sseldorf, 1879. He was a pupil at the age of nineteen at the Academy of D&uuml;sseldorf, receiving also private lessons from its president, <a href="../cathen/13518a.htm">Schadow</a>. He was an exceedingly religious man, and associated with himself three of his friends and fellow-students, Karl and Andreas M&uuml;ller, and <a href="../cathen/04677b.htm">Ernst Deger</a>, and the four men travelled about in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, studying and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> together. He persistently declined any commissions for mythological or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> subjects, and as a rule devoted his energies exclusively to church decoration, preceding the execution of his greatest works by devout religious exercises, including confession and communion. His finest <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are to be found at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, in the church of <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, and in Breslau in a church dedicated to the same saint. There is also a remarkable "Holy Family" <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1861, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for Prince Liechtenstein in his private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and many other works by him are in various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. His only important fresco was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1844 in a church at Remagen. He was a very popular <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in court circles, a member of most of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> academies, and the recipient of many medals and decorations. His colouring is correct and delicate, and yet of remarkable brilliance, and his pictures have a suave and attractive religious aspect and create a strong emotion in the minds of those who gaze at them. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a few portraits, but they were unimportant; his main work was in his altar-pieces.
