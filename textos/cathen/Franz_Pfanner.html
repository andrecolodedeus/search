<h1>Franz Pfanner</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, born at Langen, Vorarlberg, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 1825; died at <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, South Africa, 24 May, 1909. In 1850 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and was given a curacy in his native diocese. Nine years later he was appointed an <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in the Italian campaign against <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was over before he could take up his appointment. After serving as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> at <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a> for several years, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and there saw the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> for the first time. Whilst waiting for his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission to join this order, he went on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land. In November, 1864, he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Marienwald in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and was made sub-prior a few weeks later. He again went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1866, where he reorganized the well-known <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Tre Fontane. Then he conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a foundation in Turkey. The difficulties seemed insuperable, but in 1869 he was able to open the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mariastern in Bosnia, which was raised to the status of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1879. In that year Bishop Richards of the Eastern Vicariate of the Cape of Good Hope was in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, seeking <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/08591b.htm">Kafirs</a> and to teach them to work. When all others had declined the invitation, Abbot Franz resolved to relinquish his settled <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and face fresh difficulties in South Africa. At the end of July, 1880, he arrived at Dunbrody, the place purchased by Bishop Richards for the work. But on account of the drought, winds and baboons, he declared the site unsuitable after a trial of several years. With the permission of Bishop Jolivet, O.M.I., of the Natal Vicariate, he then (December, 1882) bought from the Land Colonization Company a part of the farm Zoekoegat, near Pinetown. The fine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mariannhill was built here, and it soon became the centre of a great work of civilization. Finding the need of a sisterhood to teach the <a href="../cathen/08591b.htm">Kafir</a> girls, with characteristic energy he founded the Sisters of the Precious Blood, who number more than 300. In 1885 Mariannhill was created an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Prior Franz Pfanner elected the first mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. But in 1893 he resigned his prelacy and began life again in the mission station of <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, where he remained until his death.

<p>The missionary methods of Abbot Franz and his successors have won the approval of all those interested in the natives of South Africa. Such various authorities as Mark Twain and the last Prime Minister of the Cape have spoken enthusiastically of the work. It has prospered exceedingly. At the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of Abbot Franz's death there were 55 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 223 lay-brothers and 326 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> working in 42 mission stations among the natives. Only a few months before Abbot Franz's death the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, at the petition of the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> of Mariannhill, made a considerable change in their status. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Rule in its rigour, for which Abbot Pfanner was most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, was found to be an obstacle to missionary development in some particulars. Hence the name of the order was changed to that of the Missionary Religious of Mariannhill, and they were given a milder rule on a three years' trial, after which the whole subject will again be submitted to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
