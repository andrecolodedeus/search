<h1>Franz Wilhelm, Count von Wartenberg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, eldest son of Duke Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and his morganatic wife Maria Pettenbeckin, born at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1 March, 1593; died at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1 December, 1661. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> (1601-8), and at the Germanicum in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1608-14). In 1621 he became manager of the governmental affairs of the Elector Ferdinand of Cologne, who appointed him president of his council and brought him to the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1622. On 26 Oct., 1625, he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, receiving <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> 25 April, 1626. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in Osnabr&uuml;ck was then in a deplorable condition. The three preceding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and had replaced most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers. Cardinal Eitel Friedrich, who succeeded them, endeavoured to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion but soon died. With the help of <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly</a> Wartenberg took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (12 March, 1628), which had been occupied by <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> soldiers. He began the work of <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; drove the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers from the city and restored the churches to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. He eliminated the anti-Catholic element from the city council; took the system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> into his own hands; turned the former Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> over to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> whom he engaged as teachers at the Gymnasium Carolinum; restored various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities and established new ones; held <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and visitations, enforced the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees where possible and, in 1631, founded a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> which, however, was destroyed by the Swedes in 1633.

<p>Wartenberg was commissioned with the execution of the Edict of Restitution (1629) in Lower Saxony, and was elected later to the provostry of the collegiate church of Bonn. He was chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verden (1630), Minden (1631), and appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> (1645). In 1633 Osnabr&uuml;ck capitulated to the Swedes and Wartenberg had to yield his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Gustavus of Wasaburg, an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Gustavus Adolphus. During his forced exile, Wartenberg, who had not yet received any of the major orders, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1636. In 1641 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and upon his return was elected Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> <em>cum jure successionis</em>, succeeding on 9 April, 1650. In the negotiations of the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1645-8) he represented the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> electors. Though preventing the intended secularization of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by the Swedes, he had to yield to the stipulation that after his death the <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">See of Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> should be alternately administered by a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Wartenberg was to keep the <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">See of Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, but the Sees of Verden, <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, and Bremen fell into the hands of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, Wartenberg, however, retaining <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over them. On 18 Dec., 1650, he took possession of the <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">See of Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> and laboured to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. On 5 April, 1661, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>.
