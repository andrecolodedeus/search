<h1>Franz Xaver Dieringer</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 22 August, 1811, at Rangeningen (Hohenzollern-Hechingen); d. 8 September, 1876, at Veringendorf. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, 19 Sept., 1835, and appointed instructor at the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> there. In the autumn of 1840 he became professor of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> of Speier and at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1841, was also made professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the lyceum of the same city. In the spring of 1843 he was appointed professor in ordinary of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and homiletics at the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>, and provisional inspector of the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. When at his instance a homiletic-catechetical <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was established in 1844, he took charge of the homiletic section. The prestige of the faculty of Bonn had suffered sadly because of the inroads of <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesianism</a>, and this learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, who was eminently qualified for the work of academic teaching, set about to restore its fallen glory. His brilliant and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> activity, especially during the first two decades of his office, placed him in the first rank among the shining lights of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Besides performing the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his professorship, he published the "Katholische Zeitschrift fur Wissenschaft und Kunst," a periodical devoted to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and church interests, which he had founded in 1844 in opposition to the periodical of the <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesians</a>, and conducted in a truly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit.From 1847 to 1849 it appeared as the "Katholische Vierteljahresschrift". Dieringer took a prominent part in the founding of the <a href="../cathen/02688c.htm">Society of St. Charles Borromeo</a> in 1845, of which he was at first secretary and then president from 1846-1871. In 1853, though retaining his professorship and residing at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, he was made canon of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councillor. In 1848 he represented the district of Neuss in the parliament at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>.

<p>His name was among those proposed in 1856 for the vacant <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">See of Paderborn</a> and in 1864 for that of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, but it was removed by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government. Though his earlier teaching, especially in his "Laienkatechismus", had been in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, he yielded, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, to personal motives and to the influence of his colleagues at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> and joined the opposition. He had no thought, however, of leaving the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, after negotiations of some length, he yielded to the demand of <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Archbishop Melchers</a> and made his submission. In order to escape from the strained relations which existed among the divided faculty, Dieringer resigned his offices and dignities during the spring of 1871 and took charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Veringendorf in Hohenzollern. In 1874 he was among those recommended for the <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Freiburg</a>, but he could not accede to the demands of the Baden Govermnent. After 1874 he was constantly in failing health.

<p>Dieringer's principal publications are: "System der g&ouml;ttlichen Thaten des Christenthums, oder, Selbst-begr&uuml;ndung des Christenthums, voilzogen durch seine g&ouml;ttlichen Thaten" (Mainz, 1841, 2nd ea., 1857), a work which clearly shows the influence of <a href="../cathen/14282b.htm">Staudenmaier</a>, especially in its first edition; and the "Lehrbuch der katholischen Dogmatik" (Mainz, 1847; 5th ed., 1865), a book of great merit and formerly much used. An excellent work on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in popular form is his "Laienkatechismus &uuml;ber Religion, Offenbarung and Kirche" (Mainz, 1865; 2nd ed. 1868). Another book also in popular style, "Der heil. Karl Borrom&auml;us und die Kirchenverbesserung seiner Zeit" (Cologne, 1846), appeared as the first publication of the <a href="../cathen/02688c.htm">Society of St. Charles Borromeo</a> and had a wide circulation. Besides these publications there remain to be mentioned the two homiletic works: "Kanzelvortr&auml;ge an gebildete Katholiken auf alle Sonn- und Festtage des Kirchenjahres" (Mainz, 1844) and "Das Epistelbuch der katholischen Kirche, theologisch erkl&auml;rt" (Mainz, 1863); the polemical writings: "Offenes Sendschreiben &uuml;ber die kirchlichen Zust&auml;nde der Gegenwart an Dr. J. B. von Hirscher" (Mainz, 1849, against Hirseher's publication under the same title); "Dogmatische Erorterungen mit einem G&uuml;ntherianer" (Mainz, 1852);, "Die Theologie der Vor- und Jetztzeit, ein Beitrag zur Verst&auml;ndigung" (Bonn, 1868; 2nd ed., 1869; against <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen's</a> "Theologie der Vorzeit"), which appeared first in the "Theologisches Literaturblatt" of Bonn 1868); and: "Expositio doctrinae Tertulliani de republica et de officiis ac iuribus civium christianorum" (University Program; Bonn, 1850).
