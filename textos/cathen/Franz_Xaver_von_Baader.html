<h1>Franz Xaver von Baader</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1765; died at the same place, 23 May, 1841.

<p>I. The idealistic stream of German philosophy which started with <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> and culminated, in two divergent branches, in <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> and Schopenhauer, encountered on the one side an opposing current of empirical realism setting back from Herbart, and on the other a partly reactionary, and yet partly concurrent movement originating in certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thinkers. Prominent among the latter was Baader. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> at sixteen and taken his doctorate at nineteen, he continued his <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> studies two years longer at <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna</a> and then assisted his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who was court physician. He soon gave this up, however, for mining engineering and after considerable travel in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he spent about five years in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1791-96), where he became acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> of B&ouml;hme and with the extremely opposite empiricism of Hume and Hartley. The work of William Godwin, "Enquiry concerning Political Justice", not only called his attention to moral and social questions but also led him to German philosophy, especially to that of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>. Baader had a temperamental sympathy for the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mystic B&ouml;hme, but for <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's philosophy</a>, especially its <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> autonomism, viz.: that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> alone and apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the primary source of the supreme rule of conduct, he had nothing but disgust. This he calls "devil's morality" and fiercely declares that were <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> visibly to reappear on earth it would be in the garb of a professor of moral philosophy. For the English <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a> he had both a natural and an acquired aversion. Reared and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, though holding some decidedly un-Catholic notions, he could find no satisfaction in reason <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Passing through Hamburg on his return from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he met Jacoby, with whom he long lived in close friendship. Schelling likewise counted him as a friend and owed to him some of the mystical trend of his system. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> Baader was made Superintendent of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> mines and was subsequently raised to the nobility for his services. He was awarded a prize of 12,000 gulden given by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government for an important discovery relating to the use of Glauber salts instead of potash in the manufacturing of glass. Retiring from business in 1820 he soon afterwards published his "Fragmenta Cognitionis" (1822-25), and at the opening of the University of Munich, in 1826, he was appointed professor of speculative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. His philosophico-religious lectures (published as "Speculative Dogmatik", 1827-36) attracted much attention. In 1838, however, a ministerial order prohibiting <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> from lecturing on such subjects <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to restrict himself to anthropology. Vigorous in body and in mind he pursued his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> work until his final illness.

<p>II. Baader's "Tag und Studien B&#252;cher" (Diary), printed in the first volume of his works, affords an insight into the vicissitudes of his mind and the development of his ideals. It was primarily to his early religious training under his domestic tutor, Sailer, subsequently <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Landshut, that he owed the convictions with which he combated the prevailing <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> by appealing to innate experience and the subjective necessity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Religious reading supplemented by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> strengthened his natural tendency towards <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Then, too, his eagerness to comprehend <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> more thoroughly than the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> succeeded in doing &#151; the hope of finding the key, as he says, to the world of mind by putting himself in direct correspondence with the ideal &#151; drew him, in an age poor in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a>, towards a mystical literature which had combated, if not successfully, at least with earnestness and good intent, both German and the French <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>. Saint-Martin's "Philosophe inconnu", which fell into his hands in 1787, carried him back to B&ouml;hme and thence to the whole <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophic</a> tradition which this German mystic had given to the modern world &#151; to Paracelsus, <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckart</a>, Eriugena, the Cabbala, and the earlier <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. He encountered on his way back to the past a tangible <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, notably in the works of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> upon which he comments in his Diary, but also in the Fathers and especially in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>.

<p>Since, however, it was alien <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which had led him to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the authority of the latter remained more or less confounded with that of the former. Moreover, his study of the English empiricists and of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> gave a critical cast to his thought if it did not add to his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In placing theogonic speculations at the basis of his physical and moral <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and in seeking from <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> an answer to the riddles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, he thought to reach a solution of the fundamental problems of his time and realize the dream of his youth &#151; a religious philosophy. Joining the contemplations of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> to the exactness of criticism he endeavoured to justify the appeal to both. Mysticism was to fructify criticism and criticism authorize <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. He aimed thus at opposing the negative with a positive <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> (metaphysical, and especially <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> concepts declared unknowable by <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>) were to find their justification and verification in the human, but at the same time Divinely impressed, consciousness. Reason and feeling separated by <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> were reunited by Baader. Jacoby's appeal to emotion for the certitude of <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Baader saw to be, at best, but a negative, an irrational escape, while Fichte, by making such <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the creation of the Ego, failed to account for the Ego itself. The <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> logomachy of the Ego and the non-Ego could no more satisfy Baader than could Schelling's assertion of the absolute identity of subject and object. He had seen from the start the sterility of Schelling's principle and had confuted its <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>.



<p>Baader's aim was a theistic philosophy which would embrace the worlds of nature and of spirit and afford at once a metaphysical solution of the problem of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (science) and an understanding of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and the Divine activity as manifested by revelation. Whatever be thought of this ambitious endeavour, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> student must recognize its variance both with philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Baader's system surpasses both in depth and in breadth all the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> of his time. He owes this pre-eminence not only to a deeper penetration, but likewise to a broader survey which embraced and estimated many of the facts and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the past. Unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> derived from B&ouml;hme led him into a fanciful interpretation of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while his attempt at rationalizing those mysteries was often hardly less bizarre. His system, therefore, if it may so be called, had the misfortune, on the one hand, of being ignored because of its purpose to synthesize <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> and revive the old philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; and, on the other, of being rejected because it disfigured <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> by its rationalizing spirit. It consequently may be said to have exercised an intensive and transitional, rather than an extensive and definitive, influence on the movement of thought. English sensism having resulted <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> in scepticism, and <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> critical effort to save some <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> by purely subjective scrutiny having hopelessly lost the mind in a maze of its own spinning, Baader saw that the only <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> lay in a return to the traditional line of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which had been broken off by <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. Unfortunately in resuming that line Baader unwound some of its essential strands and inwove others of less consistent fibre wherewith the remaining threads would not cohere. But in this very harking back to a saner past Baader was influential in hastening the healthier revival which was more definitely effected by his countrymen <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> and St&ouml;ckl. Moreover, in so far as Baader opposed the prevailing <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> and defended <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, his influence is declared by so unprejudiced a writer as Robert Adamson to have extended beyond the precincts of Baader's Church. <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">Rothe's</a> "Theologische Ethik" is thoroughly impregnated with his spirit, and among others, J. M&uuml;ller's "Christl. Lehre von der S&uuml;nde" and Martinsen's "Christl. Dogmatik" show evident marks of his influence.

<p>III. It is extremely difficult to give any satisfactory conception of Baader's system within narrow limits. Baader was a most fertile writer but threw out his thoughts in aphorisms, some of which indeed he subsequently collected, but most of which received their development in reviews and personal correspondence. Even his two principal works, "Fragmenta Cognitionis" and "Speculative Dogmatik", are really <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and one has to seek long before discovering any unifying principles. Moreover, he moves in leaps; his style lacks coherence and order. A suggestive expression, a Latin or Franch quotation gives an unlooked-for turn to a discourse. The reader is knocked about from one side to another. Now he may be driven from <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> to <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> and again from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to physical philosophy. The author's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> often run into those of others leaving no line of demarcation. Add to this the uncertainty of his terminology, his equivocal and often bizarre use, or abuse, of words and the reading of Baader becomes no easy occupation. A summary of his system may be given as follows:

<p>(1) Man's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a participation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The latter necessarily compenetrates the former which is therefore always <em>con-scientia</em>. Our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, something received, and in this respect is faith which is therefore a voluntary acceptance of the known object from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> knowing in us and hence proceeds from the will. This, however, is preceded by an unvoluntary subjection, a necessitated desire &#151; <em>Nemo vult nisi videns</em>. We experience the Indwelling Presence soliciting us to faith. Faith however, in turn, becomes the basis of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in which again faith reaches its completion. Faith is thus as necessary for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is for faith. Now the content of faith is expressed by technical formul&aelig; in religious tradition. Hence as philosophy is necessarily connected with the subjective process of faith, so is it likewise with that of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>. Only thus can it begin and develop. Hence all <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, all philosophy, is religious. Natural theology, natural ethics, etc., strictly speaking, are impossible. Philosophy arose only when religious tradition called for explication and purification. Afterwards it divorced itself, but it thus led to its own dissolution.

<p>(2) But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not simply a gift (<em>Gabe</em>); it is also a responsibility (<em>Aufgabe</em>). It must be developed by reason, penetrated, vivified, and freed from the possibility of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. It is not memory, nor a mere <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the past. It must cast off the temporary but retain the abiding; be permanent but progressive. Mysteries are not impenetrable, but only concealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>: "Deum esse non creditur sed scitur" are twin <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. The whole content of religion must be reduced to exact <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. There is no closed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> just as there is no closed <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Science proceeds from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is developed and recast by <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.

<p>The hopeless confusion here manifest between <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as a natural or purely rational process, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> virtue, finds a parallel in Baader's ethics. With him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, i.e. religious, and hence <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, ethics knows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who gives the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> also fulfils it in us, so that from being a burden it ceases to be a law. Fallen man has not the power to restore himself; hereditary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the seed of the Serpent, hinders him in this. Still he retains the "Idea", the seed of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, i.e. redeemableness. This possibility is actualized by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> becoming man, and thus realizing the moral law in "the Man", the Saviour, Who by overcoming temptation has destroyed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at its centre and from within, and Who has crushed the Serpent's head. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, too, must be destroyed from without by constant <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of ego-hood. In this task man cooperating with his fellows for the attainment of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is neither a solitary worker, as the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> would say, nor completely inactive, as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> teaches. Like hereditary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,grace propagates itself <em>quasi per infectionem vitae</em>. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> and the Eucharist place man <em>en rapport</em> with Christ, through Whom man, if he cooperate, will be restored to the spiritualized condition whence he fell by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This spiritualization thus becomes the final subjective end for the individual and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>.

<p>The religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> here appears as the source and the life of Baader's sociology. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and neighbour is the unitive principle of all social existence, liberty, and equality; as the opposite principle of self-love is the root of all disunion, slavery, and despotism. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the binding source of all law, from Him is all social authority. Hence Baader strongly opposes the might-makes-right <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Hobbes, and the social contract of Rousseau, no less than <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> autonomism, which regards religion as an appendage of morality. Now the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and the moral and juridic law being inseparably conjoined, and neither having actual existence save in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which is concrete in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> (the State), and religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> (the Church), should co-operate. Baader apparently until towards the close of his life held that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should have direct &#151; not simply indirect &#151; authority even in civil affairs, and he was enthusiastic for a reinstatement, in a form adapted to his times, of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> relation between the two orders. But a change seems to have come over his mind &#151; occasioned very probably by some personal irritation which he felt at the criticism to which his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teachings were subjected &#151; and he taught for a short time opinions concerning the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Papacy which were utterly irreconcilable with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, while the language in which these opinions was conveyed was as unbecoming the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> as it was his subject. Before his death, however, he retracted this portion of his teaching.

<p>While Baader's sociology maintains that religion is the very root and life of civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, it takes account also of political and economic administration. Thus it contains his opinions favouring the organization of the classes, the revival of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> "corporations" or industrial associations, the political representation of the proletariat, and some well-reasoned objections to unlimited industrial competition and free trade. On the whole, his sociology is the wisest, strongest, sanest, and most practical part of his whole system, just as his technical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is the weakest, the most bizarre, unsound, and impractical. The reason of the difference may not improbably be found in the fact that in the former the best elements of his own mind and character were free to assert themselves, while in his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> they seem almost throughout to be under the spell of B&ouml;hme whose fanciful <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> bore him away to a region as far removed from experience &#151; present and past &#151; as from the world of reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Apart from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> Baader's teachings have a permanent value.
