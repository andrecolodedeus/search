<h1>Franz Xaver von Funk</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church historian</a>, b. in the small market town of Abtsgem&uuml;nd in W&uuml;rtemberg, 12 October, 1840; d. at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, 24 February, 1907.

<p>The son of an inn-keeper, Franz first attended the gymnasium at Ellwagen, and, on finishing his course of secondary studies, proceeded in 1859 to the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>. Residing at the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> house of studies called Wilhelmsstift he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and also found time to attend courses in classical philology and political economy with such profit that in 1862 he gained the prize offered by the faculty of political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> for the best essay on the theme: "Was verstand man in 18. Jahrhundert unter Polizei?" (What signification had the word <em>police</em> in the 18th century?). Some of his earlier publications treated subjects connected with political economy. Having received his doctorate of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in 1863, he devoted a year in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> to <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and preparation for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, 10 August, 1864, and his first work was in the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; he felt, however, that the whole bent of his mind lay in the direction of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> labour. In October, 1865, he obtained permission to proceed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to pursue further the study of political economy; the journey through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and his residence at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> acted as a great <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> stimulus. On his return in 1866, he was appointed tutor at the Wilhelmsstift, where his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to direct the personal studies and preparation for examinations of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students. When Hefele, then professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1868 as consultor during the preparation for the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, Funk acted as substitute. Hefele did not return to his chair, being appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a> on 17 June, 1869, and Funk was appointed his successor. In 1870 Funk was named extraordinary, and in 1875 ordinary professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, patrology, and <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a>, an office which he filled till his death.

<p>His life was henceforth entirely devoted to his professorial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and historical researches, especially to the various branches of the history of the early Church. His first important publications belong to the sphere of political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and the history of economics, and include the two treatises, "Zins und Wucher, eine moraltheologische Abhandlung" (T&uuml;bingen, 1878). Other articles on the same subject written by his either during this or a later period are: "Klemens von Alexandrien &uuml;ber Familie und Eigentum" ["Theologische Quartalschrift" (1871), 427-449; reprinted in "Kirchengeschichtliche Abhandlungen und Untersuchungen", II, 45 sqq.]; "Handel und Gewerbe im christlichen Altertum" [in "Theol. Quartalschrift" (1876); reprinted in "Kirchengesch. Abhand. u. Untersuch.", II, 60 sqq.]; "Ueber Reichtum und Handel in christlichen Altertum" [Ibid., III, 150 sqq., first published in "Histor.-politische Bl&#228;tter" (1902), II]. Funk's professorial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and his early study of classical philology soon led him into the province of <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian literature</a> and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and in these departments he accomplished his most important work as a scholar. In the former department his task consisted principally in the issuing of new editions of texts, prepared in accordance with the rules of historical and textual criticism. His predecessor Hefele had issued a scholarly edition of the works of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>, "Opera patrum apostolicorum", but the last edition was that of 1855, and the discovery of important <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> rendered a new edition <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Funk undertook the task and the "Opera patrum apostolicorum" appeared in two volumes (T&uuml;bingen, 1878-1881), the first containing the authentic and the second the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings. After the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>, a new edition of the first volume was issued in 1887; a fresh edition (the second) of the whole work appeared in 1901. The "Sammlung von Quellenschriften" (T&uuml;bingen, 1901; 2nd ed., 1906) contains a synopsis with the text of the authentic writings. Funk also published separately the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> and certain of the early writings connected with this work ("Doctrina XII apostolorum", "Canones apostolorum ecclesiastici ac reliqu&aelig; doctrin&aelig; de duabus viis expositiones veteres", T&uuml;bingen, 1887). His studies of the "Apostolic Constitutions" led Funk to the conviction that the existing editions of the "Constitutiones apostolic&aelig;" and of the Syrian "Didascalia apostolorum" were unsatisfactory. He devoted many years to the preparation of a new edition, which was given to the public in 1905 ("Didascalia et Constitutiones Apostolorum", ed. F. X. von Funk, 2 vols., Paderborn, 1905), and was received with the greatest commendation by the learned world. He also published three works connected with <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian literature</a>. In the treatise "Die Echtheit der Ignatianischen Briefe" (T&uuml;bingen, 1883), he successfully refuted the attacks made on these important sub-apostolic writings, and demonstrated conclusively the authorship of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>.

<p>For many years his attention was almost exclusively devoted to a group of writings, which constitute the principal source of information as to early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> liturgy and discipline, namely the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>, the Didascalia, the Apostolic Constitutions, the "Canones Hippolyti", the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Church Order, and the "Testamentum Domini nostri Jesu Christi" discovered by Rahmani. In opposition to the somewhat different views of other investigators, Funk sought to establish the connexion between these writings, and from this the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their origin. The two works, which Funk devoted to this subject, are: "Die Apostolischen Konstitutionen" (T&uuml;bingen, 1891), and "Das Testament unseres Herrn und die verwandten Schriften" (Mainz, 1901). Similar investigations in the field of literary history and numerous questions touching on the liturgy, discipline and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times form the subject of the numerous articles which Funk contributed to various periodicals during the many years of his academic activity. Most of these articles were published in the "T&uuml;binger theologische Quartalschrift", the "Historisches Jahrbuch der G&ouml;rresgesellschaft", the "Historisch-politische Bl&#228;tter" or in the "Revue d'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique", and the majority are included, in more or less revised form, in the collection: "Kirchengeschichtliche Abhandlungen und Untersuchungen" (3 vols., Paderborn, 1897, 1899, 1907). Among the most important of these writings are those dealing with the above-mentioned pseudo-Apostolic works and their relations to one another ("Abhandlungen", II, 108 sqq., 136 sqq., 359 sqq., III, 64 sqq., 218 sqq., 275 sqq., 359 sqq., 362 sqq., 381 sqq.); the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> penitential discipline and the catechumenate (Ibid., I, 155 sqq., 182 sqq., 209 sqq.; III, 42 sqq., 57 sqq.); <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in major orders (Ibid., I, 121 sqq.); the Agap&aelig; and the Eucharistic Sacrifice (Ibid., I, 278, 293 sqq., III, 1 sqq., 85 sqq., 134 sqq.). One subject to which he often returned and which involved him in a long controversy with other scholars, especially with Father Kneller, S.J., was the convocation and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification of the &aelig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the early ages [Abhandlungen, I, 39 sqq., 87 sqq., 498 sqq., III, 143 sqq., 406 sqq.; Kneller returned to the subject again in the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r katholische Theologie" (1908), 75-99]. Of the various contributions to later <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a>, which flowed from Funk's industrious pen, may be mentioned the "Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der altbritischen Kirche" (Abhand., I, 421 sqq.), "Gerson und Gersen" (Ibid., II, 473 sqq.), "Der Verfasser der Nachfolge Christe" (Ibid., II, 408 sqq.), "Zur Galilei-Frage" (Ibid., II, 444 sqq.). Funk was an industrious contributor to the second edition of <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder's</a> "Kirchenlexikon", in which are found no less than 136 articles, some of considerable length, from his pen. For Kraus's "Real-Encyclop&#228;die der christlichen Altert&uuml;mer" he also wrote several articles. The excellence of his "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte", as a general <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, is universally recognized; the first edition appeared in 1886, the fifth in 1907, shortly before his death, the tireless worker being suddenly cut down in the midst of his labours by an apoplectic stroke. The T&uuml;bingen "Theologische Quartalschrift" for 1907 (p. 236 sqq.) contained a posthumous article of Funk's on the reputed writings of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historians whom <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has produced in the last three decades Funk was undoubtedly the greatest authority and the chief historical writer on early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times. Clear and purely critical in method, his sole aim was the establishment of historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. His character was frank and conscientious; his life was blameless, as became a minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As a controversalist he could be severe when an opponent allowed himself to be swayed by any other motive than the demonstration of exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. His method has created a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historians of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> which has been a benefit to the advancement of earnest historical investigation and scholarly criticism.
