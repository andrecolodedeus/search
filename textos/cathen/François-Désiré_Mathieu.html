<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois-D&eacute;sir&eacute; Mathieu</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born 27 May, 1839; died 26 October, 1908. Born of humble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at Einville, Department of Meurthe and Moselle, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he made his studies in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Diocese of Nancy</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1863. He was engaged successively as professor in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (<em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>) of Pont-A-Mousson, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Dominicanesses at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> (1879), and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Saint-Martin at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson (1890). Meanwhile, he had won the Degree of Doctor of Letters with a Latin and a French thesis, the latter being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a prize from the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> for two years. On 3 January, 1893, he was <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> to the Bishopric of Angers, was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> on 19 January, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 20 March. He succeeded <a href="../cathen/06277a.htm">Mgr Freppel</a>, one of the most remarkable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his time, and set himself to maintain all his predecessor's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. To these he added the work of facilitating the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> children destined for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He inaugurated the same <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> enterprise in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, to which he was transferred three years later (30 May, 1896) by a formal order of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. In his new See he laboured, in accordance with the views of this pontiff, to rally <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the French Government. With this aim he wrote the "Devoir des catholiques", an episcopal charge which attracted wide attention and earned for him the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> congratulations. In addition he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at the curia (19 June, 1899). Having resigned the See of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (14 December, 1899), his activities were thenceforward absorbed in the work of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a> and some diplomatic negotiations which have remained secret. Nevertheless, he found leisure to write on the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1903. In 1907 he was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> with a discourse which attracted much notice. Death came to him unexpectedly next year in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, whither he had gone to assist at the <a href="../cathen/05592a.htm">Eucharistic Congress</a>. Under a somewhat common place exterior he had rich and active nature, an inquiring and open mind, a fine and well-cultivated <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> which did credit to the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. His works include "De Joannis abbatis Gorziensis vita" (Nancy 1878); "L'Ancien R&eacute;gime dans la Province de Lorraine et Barrois" (Paris, 1871; 3rd ed., 1907); "Le Concordat de 1801" (Paris, 1903); "Les derniers jours de Leon XIII et le conclave de 1903" (Paris, 1904); a new edition of his works began to appear in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, July, 1910.
