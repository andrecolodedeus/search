<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois-Louis Blosius</h1>  

<p>(Also called <em>de Blois</em>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and spiritual writer, born at Donstienne, near <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, 1506; died at <a href="../cathen/09238b.htm">Liessies</a>, 1566.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were nobles of Hainault, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> being Sieur of Jumigny. He became page to the Archduke Clares (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>) but entered the Abbey of Liessies when only fourteen. Whilst still a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> he was sent to study at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, whence he was recalled in 1527 to become coadjutor to the Abbot, Gilles Gippus, his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> as such being confirmed by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>. Three years later, in 1530, he succeeded Gippus as thirty-fourth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Liessies, and received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and the abbatial blessing in the same year. His first care was the cultivation in his abbey of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> monastic spirit and strict discipline, which had somewhat declined under his predecessors. He had hardly settle down to the work of reform before <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> was immersed in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> owing to its invasion by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a>, which occurred in 1537. Liessies, being on the frontier, became in consequence an unsafe habitation and Blosius proposed a move to the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Ath, in the interior, but most of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, being opposed to his reform, either elected to remain at <a href="../cathen/09238b.htm">Liessies</a> or else went to other laxer <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, however, with three <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, returned to Ath and there he at once restored the primitive observance of the rule. In spite of opposition the reform gained ground and numbers increased rapidly. When a return to Liessies became possible, in 1545, the reform was accepted by those that had remained there and was confirmed by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>, Blosius next began a restoration and enlargement of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> buildings, which were only completed after his death. In 1556 <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> offered him the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> and the abbacy of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, both of which he refused in order that he might remain at <a href="../cathen/09238b.htm">Liessies</a>. In personal character he was distinguished for his gentleness, his generosity to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of chastity, and his <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Mother of God</a>. He was a diligent student, especially of the Scriptures, the works of the Fathers, and the <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical</a> writers of the fourteenth century. His own writings were numerous, the chief being <ul><li>"Speculum Monachorum", written in Latin <li>"Entretiens spirituels", and <li>"Instructions spirituelles et pens&eacute;es consolantes". His complete works were first published at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1568 and have been many times reprinted and translated. </ul>
