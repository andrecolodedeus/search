<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Combefis</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">Patrologist</a>, b. November, 1605, at Marmande in Guyenne; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 23 March, 1679. He made his preliminary studies in the Jesuit College at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in 1624. After finishing his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course, he became professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and taught in several houses of his order. In 1640 he was transferred to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where the opportunities for research afforded by the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> led him to abandon teaching and to undertake the publication of patristic texts. He published successively the works of <a href="../cathen/01438a.htm">Amphilochius of Iconium</a>, of Methodius of <a href="../cathen/11541a.htm">Patara</a>, and of Andreas of Crete, together with some hitherto unedited writings of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. In 1648 appeared his "Novum Auctarium Graeco-Latinae Bibliothecae Patrum" in two parts, exegetical and historico-dogmatic. The "Historia haeresis monothelitarum sanctaeque in cam sextae synodi actorum vindiciae", which formed part of the historical section of this work, met with much opposition in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, principally because it was at variance with the opinions of <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>. The character of the work in which Combefis was engaged met so thoroughly the approval of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that in an assembly of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> held in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1655, an annual subsidy was voted to enable him to carry on his publications, the sum voted being subsequently doubled. This generous action produced the most fruitful results, and the number of his publications increased every year. In 1656 he edited <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom's</a> "De educandis Liberis", in 1660 a collection of <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a>. In 1662 there appeared the "Bibliotheca Patrum Concionatoria", or "Preachers' Library of the Fathers", a rich and comprehensive work, prepared in the most painstaking manner from all the available <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and containing a short historical account of all the authors whose names appeared in the work. Another important work, "Auctarium Novissimum Bibliothecae Patrum", appeared at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1672. The three following years saw many publications from the pen of Combefis. In 1674 appeared "Ecclesiastes Graecus, i.e. illustrium Graecorum Patrum ac oratorum digesti sermones ac tractatus", etc. In 1675 appeared "Theodoti Ancyrani adv. Nestorium liber et S. Germani patriarchae Constantinop. in S. Mariae Dormitionem et Translationem oratio historica", and in the same year an edition of the works of Maximus Confessor in two volumes with a Latin translation. A third volume of the works of Maximus Confessor was ready when Combefis died. Perhaps the most important of the works of Combefis is his edition of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> in two volumes, "Basilius magnus ex integro recensitus, textus ex fide optimorum codicum ubique castigatus, auctus, illustratus, haud incerta quandoque condectura emendatus. Versiones recognitae", etc. (Paris, 1679). This is a work of the highest merit and shows the critical skill of Combefis at its best, though later surpassed by the famous <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurist</a> edition (Paris, 1721-30). Besides these and several other critical editions of works of the Fathers, there are in existence some polemical works of Combefis which have little value for the present time. Though known to all the learned men of his time, and widely celebrated even in his lifetime for his great learning, Combefis always remained a mild and obedient <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>.
