<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Delfau</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, born 1637 at Montel in Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died 13 Oct., 1676, at Landevenec in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. He joined the Order of St. Benedict when he was seventeen years of age, and made his solemn profession at the Abbey of St. Allire, 2 May, 1656. He was a profound student of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and the history of the councils. Constant application to study speedily matured the powers of his exceptionally keen and brilliant mind, and he soon came to be looked upon as a foremost authority on all questions connected with patristic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. When the Congregation of St. Maur in 1670 determined to undertake a critical edition of the works of St. Augustine, Delfau was commissioned by his superiors to prepare it. The task was a difficult one, but together with six other members of the order, among them his intimate friend <a href="../cathen/07059a.htm">Dom Robert Gu&eacute;rard</a>, he began with energy and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> this great labour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and prosecuted it with an ardour truly <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. In 1671 he prepared an elaborate prospectus, setting forth the general scope and character of the new edition and the principles by which the editors were to be guided. Manuscripts came to the learned <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurists</a> from various countries, and <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Pope Clement X</a> even sent them priceless <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of the Vatican Library together with all the materials that had been gathered there under <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> for a projected edition of the Opera Augustini. When the first two volumes were about to be printed, the work was suddenly arrested, 18 Sept., 1675, by two <em>lettres de cachet</em> from <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, decreeing the banishment of both Delfau and <a href="../cathen/07059a.htm">Gu&eacute;rard</a> from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The occasion for this drastic measure seems to have been Delfau's book "L'abb&eacute; commendataire", published at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 1673, in which the young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> had severely commented on the abuses connected with the system of <em>commendam</em> as it was then shamelessly carried on in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to the great detriment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The fearless work greatly aroused the king's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, of which the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurists</a> did not fail to take advantage. Delfau was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to withdraw to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Landevenec; he lived there but little more than a year when, at the early age of thirty-eight, he was drowned as he was crossing to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Brest, where he was to deliver a eulogy on the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> of St. Teresa. Delfau's works are: "Apologia Cardinalis F&uuml;rstenbergii"; a masterly epitaph on Casimir, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who died as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s; and a dissertation on the authorship of the "Imitatio Christi", in his edition of that book (Paris, 1673).
