<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Jacquier</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> mathematician and <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a>, born at Vitry-le-Francois, 7 June, 1711; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 July, 1788. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was entrusted to an ecclesiastic, who soon recognized in him an inclination to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and mathematics, and endeavoured to cultivate it. When sixteen years old, Fran&ccedil;ois, entered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>, and after profession was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to complete his studies in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order, La Trinit&eacute; du Mont. With the permission of his superiors he specialized in mathematics, and at the same time, as a sort of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> diversion, devoted himself to the study of the ancient languages. He became very proficient in Hebrew, and spoke Greek as though it were his mother-tongue. His labours and learning gained for him the patronage of Cardinals Alberoni and Portocarrero. He accompanied Cardinal Alberoni on his legation to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and was appointed to inspect the work begun by Manfredi to prevent the repeated inundations of that territory. On his return he was given the chair of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> at the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and was also detailed by the general chapter of the Friars Minors, assembled at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, to work upon the annals of the order. The King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> named him professor of physics at the <a href="../cathen/15094a.htm">University of Turin</a> in 1745, but Cardinal Valenti, prime minister of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, eager to retain so learned a man in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had him assigned to the chair of experimental physics at the Roman College. Here he was in continual demand for consultation upon scientific matters. In 1763 he was appointed instructor in physics and mathematics to the young Prince Ferdinand at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. He was appointed in 1773 to the chair of mathematics at the Roman College, on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>. At his death he was connected with nearly all the great scientific and literary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The most important of his works are: <ul><li>"Isaaci Newtoni philosophi&aelig; naturalis principia mathematica, perpetuis commentariis illustrata" (4 parts in 3 vols. 4to, Feneva, 1739-42), in collaboration with P. Lesuer; <li>Parere e riflessioni sopra I danni della cuppola di San-Pietro" (4to, Rome, 1743); <li>"Elementi di perspecttiva secondo I princpi di Taylor" (8 vo, Rome, 1745); <li>"Institutiones Philosophic&aelig; ad studia theologica potissimum accommodata" (6 vols. in 12 mo, Rome, 1757), reprinted many times at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and later translated into Spanish; <li>"El&eacute;ments du calcul int&eacute;gral" (4to, Parma, 1768), a work highly esteemed and more complete than any that had been published up to that time. </ul>
