<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Leclerc du Tremblay</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, better known as P<font size=-2>&Egrave;RE</font> J<font size=-2>OSEPH</font>, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 4 Nov., 1577; d. at Rueil, 18 Dec., 1638. Owing to the influence of his kinsman the Constable de Montmorency, he appeared at court at the age of eighteen with the title of Baron de Maffliers, and served in the armies of Henry IV against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. On 2 Feb., 1599 he became a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of Touraine in Sept., 1613, and took part in 1616 in the negotiations of Loudun between Marie de Medicis and the malcontents led by the Prince de Cond&eacute;. To the future <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal de Richelieu</a> he furnished the opportunity of a conference with Cond&eacute;, the first service rendered by <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> to Marie de Medicis and to the State. In this way P&egrave;re Joseph appears at the opening of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> political career. The role of P&egrave;re Joseph has recently been studied anew by Abb&eacute; Dedouvres and M. Fagniez. Their researches prove that P&egrave;re Joseph remained true to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. He had visions of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> that would combine all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the purpose of his visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1616 was to discuss with <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> the schemes of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, who was planning to unite against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> the Maniots of Morca and the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> populations of the Balkans, and with this enterprise in view, founded (1617) the Order of the Christian Militia. P&egrave;re Joseph even wrote an epic poem on this subject, "La Turciade." But the conflict between the Habsburgs and the Bourbons, as well as the new prospects of the Mantuan succession open to Charles de Nevers caused the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> scheme to fail. P&egrave;re Joseph then became <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> confidential political agent, hoping that, with the Bourbons victorious, and peace established in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, it would finally be possible to march against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. His scheme was to weaken both the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, both of whom he considered enemies of the peace of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He wished <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to use the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to weaken the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to weaken the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1625, to negotiate regarding the rival claims of the Grisons and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in Valtellina. In 1630 he was sent to the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> to give quiet support to the opposition of the German princes to the claims of Emperor Ferdinand, and to strengthen the bonds of alliance between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10075b.htm">Elector Maximilian</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, head of the Catholic League. On the morrow of the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was divided between a powerless emperor and two parties, one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, both equally hostile to the empire. P&egrave;re Joseph laboured to obtain the neutrality of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and of the Catholic League in view of the invasion of Gustavus Adoiphus, protector of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; he even had hopes of forming an alliance between Maximilian and Gustavus Adolphus. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> became inevitable between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Habsburgs. and it broke out in 1635. Henceforth instead of pressing on <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> his own broad political views, P&egrave;re Joseph was content to support the makeshift policy imposed by circumstances on the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The desire for territorial expansion, which at that time governed French policy, was <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> rather than P&egrave;re Joseph s. The latter however, eagerly followed the progress of the French troops and, in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> name, kept up an active correspondence with the generals and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. Tradition represents the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> as bending over his dying friend and saying to him: "P&egrave;re Joseph, Brisach is ours." As a matter of fact the taking of Brisach, which occurred on 17 Dec., 1638, could not have been known in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on the next morning, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the death of P&egrave;re Joseph; but the tradition such as it is, symbolizes the close bond which patriotism created between these two men.

<p>While the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> inspired the secular policy of P&egrave;re Joseph, intense <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> characterized him amid all his political preoccupations. At his suggestion d Orl ans-Longueville reformed the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/06129b.htm">Fontevrault</a> and founded the congregation of Our Lady of Calvary, for whose <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> he wrote many books of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. He opposed, even more openly than <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, Richer's Gallican doctrines. P&egrave;re Joseph also founded <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> missions for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, in Poitou, Dauphin&eacute;, the Cevennes, Languedoc, Provence, and later in the East. The sending of P&egrave;re Pacifique to Constantinople in 1624, with the title of "Prefect of Eastern Missions" was the beginning of vast spiritual conquests by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in the Archipelago, the Greek peninsula, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. From <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> P&egrave;re Joseph directed this work. and in 1633 there were ten Eastern missions. It was he also who, in 1633, sent P&egrave;re Agathange of Vend&ocirc;me to found a mission in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; this same father in 1637 attempted but in vain to establish a mission in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>; finally P&egrave;re Joseph tried, but unsuccessfully, to establish a mission of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>.
