<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Montmorency de Laval</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, b. at Montigny-sur-Avre, 30 April, 1623, of Hughes de Laval and Michelle de P&eacute;ricard; d. at Quebec on 6 May, 1708. He was a scion of an illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whose ancestor was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and whose motto reads: "Dieu ayde au primer baron chrestien." He studied under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at La Fl&egrave;che, and learned philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at their college of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (Paris), where he joined a group of fervent youths directed by <a href="../cathen/02203d.htm">Father Bagot</a>. This congregation was the germ of the Seminary of Foreign Missions, famous in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>, and of which the future <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec was to be a sister institution. His two older brothers having died in battle, Fran&ccedil;ois inherited the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> title and estate. But he resisted all worldly attractions and a mother's entreaties, and held fast to his vocation. After <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (1747), he filled the office of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> at Evereux. The renowned <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, <a href="../cathen/13024a.htm">Alexander de Rhodes</a>, having obtained from <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> the appointment of three <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> for the East, Laval was chosen for the Tonquin mission. The Portuguese Court opposed the plan and from 1655 to 1658 the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lived at the "hermitage" of Caen, in the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, emulating the example of the prominent figures of that period of religious revival, <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, Vincent of Paul, Bourdoise, Eudes, and others, several of whom were his intimate friends. This solitude was a fitting preamble to his apostolic career. Appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Petrea, Laval was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 8 Dec., 1658, by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> Piccolomini in the abbatical church of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He landed on 16 June, 1659, at Quebec, which then counted hardly 500 inhabitants, the whole French population of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> not exceeding 2200 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>Laval's first relation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (1660) breathes admiration for the natural grandeur of the country, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and hope for the future, and praise for the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. From the outset he had to assert his authority, which was contested by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, from whose province came most of the colonists, and whose pretensions were favoured by the court. Laval claimed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> directly from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This conflict, which caused trouble and uncertainty, was ended when the See of Quebec was definitively erected by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> into a regular diocese depending solely on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1674). But the hardest struggle, the trial of a life-time, was against the liquor-traffic with the Indians. The problem, on whose solution depended the civilization and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the aboriginies and the welfare of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, was rendered more arduous by the intense passion of the savage for firewater and the lawless <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of the white trader. Laval, after exhausting persuasive measures and consulting the Sorbonne <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, forbade the traffic under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> pleaded in the interest of commerce, the eternal obstacle to temperance. First d'Avaugour relaxed the severity of the prohibition, but, through Laval's influence at court, was recalled. De M&eacute;sy, who owed his appointment to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, first favoured, but then <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> opposed his authority, finally dying repentant in his arms. His successors, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> authority and over-partial to commercial interests, obtained from the king a mitigated legislation. Thus, the <a href="../cathen/14438a.htm">Intendant Talon</a> and Frontenac, notwithstanding their statesmanship and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, were imbued with Gallicanism and too <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for their personal benefit. The viceroy de Tracey, however, seconded the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> action.

<p>At this period the Diocese of Quebec comprised all North America, exclusive of New England, the Atlantic sea-board, and the Spanish colonies to the West, a territory now divided into about a hundred <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Laval's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> embraced all whom he could reach by his representatives or by his personal visitations. In season and out of season, he made long and perilous journeys by land and water to minister to his flock. His fatherly kindness sustained the far-off missionary. "His heart is always with us", writes the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Dablon</a>. He was a protector and guide to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of Quebec and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. He was deeply attached to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, his former teachers, and recalled to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1670 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Recollets, who had first brought thither the Gospel. By the solemn <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Garakontie, the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> chief, an effacacious promoter of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith was secured among his barbarous fellow-countrymen, who received the black-robed <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and gave many <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>. Laval's foresight made him foster the most cherished devotions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Immaculate Conception, the titular of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the cult of the Holy Family, which flourished on <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> soil (Encyclical of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>). He was a devout client of <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01539b.htm">shrine at Beaupre</a> was rebuilt in 1673. As a patron of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> Laval occupies a foremost rank. At that early period, with a handful of colonists and scanty resources, he organized a complete system of instruction: primary, technical, and classical. His <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1663) and little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1668) trained candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>An industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, founded at St-Joachim (1678), provided the colony with skilled farmers and craftsmen. To these institutions, and particularly to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, destined to become the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> which bears his name, he gave all his possessions, including the seigniory of Beaupr&eacute; and Isle J&eacute;sus. In view of the future he built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> on a relatively large scale, which excited the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and criticism of Frontenac. No regular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> having been yet established, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were attached to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and thence radiated everywhere for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> or mission work, even as far as the Illinois. The <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, after much discussion and opposition, had finally been limited to the twenty-sixth bushel of grain harvested, an enactment still legally in force in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. These <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were paid to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which, in return provided labourers for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> vineyard. Laval's patriotism was remarkable. The creation of the Sovereign Council in lieu of the Company of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a> was greatly due to his influence, and conduced to the proper administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to the progress of colonization, and the defence of the country against the ever-increasing ferocity and audacity of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. He later concurred in obtaining the regiment of Carignan for the last-named object (1665). Exhausted by thirty years of a laborious apostolate, and convinced that a younger <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would work more efficaciously for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory and the good of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he resigned in 1688. His successor, Abb&eacute; de St-Vallier, a virtuous and generous <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, did not share all his views regarding the administration. Laval might have enjoyed a well-earned retreat in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whither he had sailed for the fourth time. He preferred returning to the scene of his labours, where many opportunities occurred of displaying his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> during the many years of St-Vallier's absence, five of which were spent in captivity in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. During that period, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was twice burned (1701 and 1705) To Laval's intense sorrow, and rebuilt through his energy and generosity. The end was near. The last three years he spent in greater retirement and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.

<p>His reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, though somewhat dimmed after the Conquest, revived during the nineteenth century, and the cause of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> having been introduced (1890), he now enjoys the title of Venerable. Laval has been accused of attachment to his own authority and disregard for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, a reproach that savours somewhat of the Gallican spirit of the time, and of the historians who endorsed their prejudices. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that he had to protect his flock from the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a>, and selfishness of worldly potentates for whom material interests were often paramount; to defend the <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the church against a domineering Frontenac, who pretended to arraign <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> before his tribunal, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> missionaries to secure a passport for each change of residence, and refused the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the rank due to his dignity and sanctioned by the king, in the council of which the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was the chief founder, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and life. In an age when <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> like <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> virtually ruled the State, Laval's authority, always exercised for the country's weal, was probably not exorbitant. He was loyal to the Crown when superior <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were not contradicted, and received nought but praise from the <em>Grand Monarque</em>. The charge of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and arbitrariness is equally groundless. In the Sovereign Council, Laval showed <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, wisdom <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, moderation. His influence was always beneficent. Although firm and inflexible in the accomplishment of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> he was ready to consult and follow competent advice. He was of the race of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, and to him likewise might have been applied the text: "Dilexisti justitiam et odisti iniquitatem." His sole <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> heart. His spirit and practice of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> and penance, his deep <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, his lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, his boundless charity towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, rank him among the most holy personages.
