<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Norbert Blanchet</h1>  

<p>Missionary and first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Oregon City</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> son of Pierre Blanchet, a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> farmer, born 30 September, 1795, near Saint-Pierre, Riviere du Sud, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>; died 18 June, 1883, at <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. After three years in the village <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he went in 1810, with his brother <a href="../cathen/02594a.htm">Augustin Magloire</a>, later the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nesqually, to the Seminary of Quebec, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 18 July, 1819. He was stationed at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for a year and was then sent to Richibucto, New Brunswick, as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac Indians</a> and Acadian settlers, among whom he spend seven years of missionary apprenticeship, enduring poverty, isolation, and innumerable hardships. In 1827 he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph de Soulanges, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of 2000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. During the cholera epidemic of 1832 Father Blanchet attended the stricken so fearlessly that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the place presented him with a testimonial. In 1837 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by Archbishop Signay for the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> mission, a vast region never before visited by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and he set out on 3 May, 1838, accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Rev. Modeste Demers</a> with the annual express of the Hudson's Bay Company. The journey from Lachine to Fort Vancouver, a distance of about 5,000 miles, was made in canoes, by portages, in barges, on horseback, and in light boats. It took them nine days to cross the Rocky Mountains, on the summit of which, at three o'clock in the morning of 16 October Father Blanchet celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. They arrived at Fort Vancouver on 24 November. The territory assigned to the two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> embraced about 375,000 square miles. It extended from <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> to Alaska and from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.

<p>For four years they laboured alone, going from settlement to settlement, facing every peril of a wild country, recalling the scattered faithful to the practice of religion and instructing the aborigines. Then two other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the Revs. A. Langlois and Z. Boldue, came to their assistance. In 1844 they were reinforced by the great missionary, <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet</a>, with four other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and six <a href="../cathen/11128b.htm">Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur</a>. The immense territory of the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> mission was made an Apostolic vicariate 1 December, 183; Father Blanchet was named its first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia. The letters from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> arrived in August, 1844. To receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he started for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> 5 December, boarded a steamer on the Columbia River, touched at Honolulu, doubled Cape Horn, landed at Dover, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, went by rail to <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, took a vessel to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> and thence proceeded by rail to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, a journey of 22,000 miles. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop Bourget int he Cathedral of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> 25 July, 1845. Later he returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, visiting <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the interests of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He gathered together six <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, four <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and seven Sisters of Notre Dame. They sailed from Brest 22 February, 1847, and reached the Columbia River on 12 August. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was translated to the See of Draza by letters of 4 May, 1844, to avoid the confusion of his former title with that of Philadelphia, U.S.A. The Vicariate was erected into a province 24 July, 1846. Bishop Blanchet was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Oregon City</a>, his brother <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Magloire</a> became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Walla Walla, and <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Father Demers</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver's</a> Island.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was indefatigable. He summoned his first provincial council in 1848; attended the First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1852; went in 1855 to South America and collected for two years in <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>; returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1859 and took back to <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> 31 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sisters, and servants. He attended the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866; celebrated, 19 July, 1869, the golden jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and in the following October set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, where he voted for the definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>. He was still in the city 26 September, 1870, when the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was overthrown. When <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Bishop Seghers</a> was made his coadjutor in 1879 he retired to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Sisters of Providence at <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>. He wrote the story of the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> mission (Historical sketches of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>) in a series of papers published in the "Catholic Sentinel" of that city. In 1880 he resigned and was appointed titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429c.htm">Amida</a>. He <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Demers</a>, D'Herbomez, and <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Seghers</a>. He found on the Pacific coast a wilderness, spiritual as well as material; the left, after forty-six years of heroic work, a well-provided <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. His name will be forever illustrious in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in America as the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the Northwest and the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>.
