<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Picquet</h1>  

<p>A celebrated Sulpician missionary in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, b. at Bourg, Bresse, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 4 Dec., 1708; d. at Verjon, Ain, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1781. He entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (1727), where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in 1731. At the Seminary of St. Sulpice in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, after winning his doctorate at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and became a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician. The same year he begged to be sent to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and in the month of July arrived at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where for five years (1734-9) he was engaged in the ministry. On the Indian mission of the Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes (now Oka), he acquired the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> tongues so perfectly that he surpassed the ablest orators of these tribes. His influence enabled him to win a large number of these savages to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. The Lake mission became very populous: Nipissings, Outaouois, Mohawks, and <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> crowded alongside the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquins</a> and <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. Picquet fortified this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> centre against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tribes, and erected the Calvary which still exists, with its well-built stations stretching along the mountain side facing the lake. In the intercolonial <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1743-8), the Indian allies of these two powers came to arms. Due to the influence of their missionary the Five Nations, hitherto allies of the English, remained neutral, while the other savages carried on a guerilla <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in New England or served as scouts for the French troops. When peace was restored, Picquet volunteered to establish an Indian post on the Presentation River, whence he spread the Gospel among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> nations, as far as the Indians of the West. Founded on 1 June, 1749, this post became the Fort of the Presentation in the following year; from it arose the town of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>, New York.

<p>In 1751 Picquet travelled round lake <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> to gather into his mission as many <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> as possible, and succeeded in establishing 392 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> at the Presentation. In 1752 Mgr. de Pontbriand, the last <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> 132 of them. A banner, preserved in the church of Oka, perpetuates the souvenir of this event, and the memory of the fidelity of the Five Nations to the cause of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, for, in the course of the Seven years' War, it floated side by side with the Fleur-de-lis on many a battlefield. In 1753 Picquet went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and presented to the minister of the Navy a well-documented memorandum concerning <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in which he pointed out the best means for preserving that colony for the French Crown. Hardly had he returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1754) when hostilities were resumed. He directed his savages against the English, whom he considered as much the enemies of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> as of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and for six years accompanied them on their expeditions and into the field of battle. "Abbe Picquet was worth several regiments", said Governor Duquesne of him. The English set a price on his head. When all hope of the cause was lost, by the order of his superiors who feared he might fall into the hands of the English, Picquet returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, passing thither through Louisiana (1760). He was engaged in the ministry in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> till 1772. He then returned to his homeland, Bresse, and was named canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Bourg, where he died.
