<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais</h1>  

<p>The life of this celebrated French writer is full of obscurities. He was born at Chinon in Touraine in 1483, 1490, or 1495. According to some his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was an apothecary, according to others a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> or inn-keeper. He began his studies with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and finished them with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> near Angers. He became a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Gontenay-le-Comte, where he remained fifteen years and received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. But the spirit of his order not being favourable to the studies then esteemed by the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and for which he himself displayed great aptitude, he left the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Through the mediation of Bishop Geoffroy d'Estissac he secured pardon from <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, who authorized him to enter the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Maillezais. In 1530 he was at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> as a medical student, and the following year professor of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and head physician at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Pont-du-Rh&ocirc;ne. At Lyon he was much in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of Dolet and Marot, and became the father of a child who died young. In 1534 Cardinal du Bellay brought him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a physician, and in 1536 he obtained from <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> which absolved him from his infractions of conventual discipline and allowed him to practice medicine. The next year he received the degree of Doctor of Medicine at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. In 1540 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> permitted him to abandon the conventual life and to join the canons of St-Maur-les-Foss&eacute;s. He took advantage of this to resume his wandering life. In 1541 he was at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> as physician to the governor, Guilliaume du Bellay. Perhaps through fear of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which his works might draw upon him he went in 1546 to practice medicine at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, where he was in the pay of the city, but Cardinal du Bellay, being again sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, induced him to go thither. Du Bellay returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the beginning of 1550 and secured for him the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> of St-Martin-du-Meudon and St-Christophe-du-Jamber, both of which he resigned two years later, after having, it is said, fulfilled his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with regularity and seriousness. He died most probably in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, either, as in generally thought, in 1553, or in 1559. Statements regarding his last moments are contradictory. According to some he died as a <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinker</a> and jester, saying, "Draw the curtain, the farce is played out", according to others his end was <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and edifying.

<p>Rabelais wrote various works, including almanacs, but he was chiefly known for the celebrated romance entitled "La Vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel". This work comprises four books which appeared from 1532 (or 1533) to 1552; a fifth, the most daring in its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, appeared after the death of its author (1562-64); it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that it is his. This history of giants is a chaos wherein are found learning, eloquence, coarse humor, and extravagances. It is impossible to analyse it.

<p>Rabelais was a revolutionary who attacked all the past, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; his religion is scarcely more than that of a spiritually-minded <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. Less bold in political matters, he cared little for liberty; his ideal was a tyrant who loves peace. His strange fictions seem to be a veil behind which he conceals his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, for he desires his readers to imitate the dog to whom a bone has been thrown and who must break it in order to reach the marrow. But many of his gigantic buffooneries were merely the satisfaction of a vast humor and boundless <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. He took pleasure in the worst obscenities. His vocabulary is rich and picturesque, but licentious and filthy. In short, as La Bruy&egrave;re says: "His book is a riddle which may be considered inexplicable. Where it is bad, it is beyond the worst; it has the charm of the rabble; where it is good it is excellent and exquisite; it may be the daintiest of dishes." As a whole it exercises a baneful influence.
