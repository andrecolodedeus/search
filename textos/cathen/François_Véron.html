<h1>Fran&ccedil;ois V&eacute;ron</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> controversialist, b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> about 1575; d. at Charenton, 1625. After brilliant studies under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> he became one and taught in several colleges. In order to devote himself more freely to preaching and controversy against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, he left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. He did not hesitate to challenge every minister he encountered, even the most learned and famous, such as Moulin, Blondel, Daill&eacute;, or Bochard. His conferences with them and many other occasional or controversial writings he afterwards published. Having secured from King Louis XIII letters patent authorizing him to deliver his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> in public and to conduct conferences with the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> or any other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> wheresoever he pleased, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to Charenton, where he was cure for ten years (1638-48), because <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> had there its chief stronghold, to Saintonge, B&eacute;arn, Brie, Champagne, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Normandy etc. Enormous success <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, which was supported by animation of spirit, facility of speech, extensive and solid learning, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. He preached before audiences of 9000 or 10,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> like Boule, after having heard him, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> after thirty years in the ministry. "He has vanquished more ministers", wrote publicly the congregation of the Propagation of the Faith, "than another could have seen, alone he has converted more <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than a thousand others." V&eacute;ron became the most celebrated controversialist in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; the general assembly of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> assigned him a pension of 600 livres yearly and accepted the dedication of some of his books of which it defrayed the expenses; the Estates of Languedoe undertook his support while he preached in their province; <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> sent his encouragement. He was invited to give lessons in controversy at the Coll&egrave;ge de France and to teach his method at Saint-Lazaire under <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> and at St. Sulpice under <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>.

<p>This method V&eacute;ron set forth in a theoretical treatise and illustrated by his other works. Since the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> reject Tradition and admit only <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> as the source and ground of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they must be required to show all their <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and all the articles of their Confession of Faith which they cannot support with formal and explicit texts from the Sacred Books should be considered as untenable. On the other hand, it is of great importance to set forth the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in all its purity; thus explained, it is entitled to the respect and the acceptance of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; hence it is important to separate authentic points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from what the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> confuse with it, for example all the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, historical <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, popular legends, or private practices. By this matter of simplifying <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and of showing consideration to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, V&eacute;ron sometimes aroused the protests of certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; his treatise on the primacy of the church wherein he refutes Blondel's work of the same name was even placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Jan., 1643). He was also accused of sometimes using blustering language and excessive harshness against his adversaries, who used the same towards him. V&eacute;ron next attacked the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, writing three books against them during the last years of his life.
<h2>Works</h2>

<p>Apart from his anti-Jansenistic works and some partial translations of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> all of V&eacute;ron's writings have to do with controversy. They are about eighty in number. Several of them are only a few pages in length; some are successive redactions of the same work under different names. Three are worthy of mention because they summarize nearly all the others: (1) "La m&eacute;thode nouvelle, acile et solide de convainere de nullit&eacute; la religion pr&eacute;tendue reform&eacute;e", published in 1615, re-edited in 1617, 1618, 1619, 1623, in several cities of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, translated into English, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and German, read and praised by Leibnitz, reprinted by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> in his "Theologiae cursus completus" (Paris, 1860); (2) "L'epitome de toutes les controverses de religion en ce si&egrave;cle" (1 vol., Paris, 1638; re-edited in 2 and 3 vols., translated into Latin, and abridged); (3) "R&egrave;gle de la foi catholique" (Paris, 1649), approved by the general assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, by the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, translated into Latin, read and praised by Leibniz, reprinted several times abroad and three times in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the nineteenth century.
