<h1>Fraticelli</h1>  

<p>(Or F<font size=-2>RATRICELLI</font>)

<p>A name given to various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which appeared in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, principally in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The word being frequently a misnomer, a definition is apposite. Considered philologically, <em>Fraticelli</em> is a diminutive derived from the <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>frate</em> (plural <em>frati</em>). <em>Frati</em> was a designation of the members of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> founded during the thirteenth century, principally the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> or <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. The Latin <em>Fraterculus</em> does not occur in the old records which concern the Fraticelli. Etymologically the name <em><a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a></em> (<em>Fratres Minores</em>) is equivalent to the diminutive <em>Fraticellus</em>. The ideal of the founder of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, St. Francis, was that his disciples by evangelical poverty, complete self-denial, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, should lead the world back to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The Italian people designated as Fraticelli all the members of religious, particularly <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a>, orders, and especially solitaries, whether these observed a definite rule or regulated their own lives.

<p>In this article the name <em>Fraticelli</em> is confined to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which separated from the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> on account of the disputes concerning poverty. The Apostolics (Pseudo-Apostles or Apostolic Brethren) are excluded from the category, because admission to the Order of St. Francis was expressly denied to their founder, Segarelli (see <a href="../cathen/01647a.htm">A<font size=-2>POSTOLICI</font> </a>). They had no connexion with the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, in fact desired rather to exterminate them. It is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to differentiate the various groups of Fraticelli, although the one term may be applied to all.

<p>The origin of the Fraticelli and the cause of their growth within and without the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> must be sought in the history of the Spirituals. It must suffice here to note that in consequence of St. Francis's severe requirements concerning the practice of poverty, his followers divided into two branches, the <em>Zelanti,</em> or Spirituals, and the <em>Relaxati,</em> known later as the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the thirteenth century intervened to bring about harmony between the two factions, and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> gave in their <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> authoritative explanations of the points at issue. But the differences were not fully adjusted nor was unity ever completely restored between the Spirituals and the main body of the order, the Community (<em>Fratres de Communitate</em>).
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The group founded by Brother Angelo da Clareno (or da Cingoli) comes first in order of time. Angelo and several brethren from the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a> had been condemned (c. 1278) to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life, but were liberated by the general of the order, Raimondo Gaufredi (1289-95) and sent to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Exiled from <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> towards the end of 1293, they returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where in 1294 <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a>, who was noted for his asceticism, but whose pontificate lasted scarcely six months, willingly permitted them to live as <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> in the strict observance of the Rule of St. Francis. After the abdication of <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a>, his successor, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, revoked all Celestine's concessions, and they <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, where some of them attacked the legality of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> action. As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, caused active measures to be taken against them, they fled to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where their leader, Fra Liberatus, attempted a vindication of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, first with <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (d. 11 October, 1303), and then with <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, who also died prematurely (7 July, 1304). On his journey to <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305-14) at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Liberatus died (1307), and Angelo da Clareno succeeded to the leadership of the community. He remained in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> until 1311, when he went to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he was protected by his patrons Cardinals Giacomo Colonna and Napoleone Orsini. Early in 1317 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, pursuant to a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, declared Angelo <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and placed him in custody. He defended himself ably in his "Epistola Excusatoria", representing himself as a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> refused to admit his plea, Angelo being a Celestine <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Sancta Romana et universalis ecclesia" (30 December, 1317) refused to authorize the congregation of which Angelo was head. Angelo submitted temporarily, but in 1318 fled to Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where, acting as general, he assumed charge of the congregation dissolved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and custodians, established new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, arrogated all authority, issued pastoral letters, and received <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; in a word, he founded an independent <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, the Fraticelli. His adherents professed themselves the original <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. They denied that <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> was really <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as he had abrogated the Rule of St. Francis, which, according to their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, represented the Gospel pure and simple. They asserted that his decrees were invalid, all other religious and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were damned, and that the commission of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> deprived <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> dignity and powers. These views were brought out in the trials to which the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> adherents of Fra Angelo were subjected by the inquisitors, especially in 1334. In the processes of these trials and in numerous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> they are called, as a rule, <em>Fraticelli seu fratres de paupere vit&#226;</em>. As appears from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>, the followers of Angelo established themselves in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, i.e., in the province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Umbria, and the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, and also in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Campagna, Basilicata, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>). Fra Angelo enjoyed the protection of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, in spite of the fact that <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (21 Feb., 1334) commanded the guardian of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> at Ara C&aelig;li to imprison Angelo, "the demented <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who styles himself general of the condemned <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Fraticelli". Equally unsuccessful had been a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> warrant issued for his arrest (22 November, 1331), when he fled to Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He died 15 July, 1337, and the congregation, deprived of its leader and hard pressed by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, split into a number of groups each holding its own doctrines, though it is impossible to determine exactly their origin. It should further be noted that after the controversy regarding poverty broke out (1321-28), all the Fraticelli showed a stronger opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. It was only natural that men of their calibre and extreme tendencies should fall into excesses; but, schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as they were, the moral lapses of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are not to be imputed to the whole body, which after all was but loosely organized. Angelo da Clareno, despite the circumstances of his death, was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a worker of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.



<p>Keeping in view the earlier history of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, we shall have to seek traces of it in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Umbria and the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>. Angelo was highly esteemed by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a>, with whom he was on friendly terms, especially with <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> da Foligno and Simone da Cassia, an <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writer of great repute. He corresponded with both, and Simone bitterly laments in the death of Angelo the loss of a friend and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a>. We may, therefore, safely assume that the Fraticelli whom Simone afterwards successfully defended against the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in the civil courts at Florence (c. 1355), where he was then preaching, were adherents of Clareno. The same is probably <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, also, of the Fraticelli in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> who about the same time were attacked in the sensational, though neither learned nor skillful, letters of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, Fra Giovanni dalle Celle. The letters were answered by the Fraticelli. Giovanni went even so far as to use Fra Angelo as a pawn against his adversaries. These, indeed, had separated themselves entirely from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. They had attained such power in Florence that they invited the "theologians" to public debate. The "theologians", i.e. the official <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, did not respond. On 13 October, 1378, the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> of Florence enacted a statute against the Fraticelli; on 8 July, 1381, the city council of Florence commanded them to leave the city in two days or face the tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. They were respected so highly, however, that, when their expatriation was demanded by the city magistrates in the same year (14 December, 1381), one of the councillors took a bold stand against the proposal.

<p>Nevertheless, Fra Michele Berti, from Calci near <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, a member of the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> branch of Fraticelli, after preaching the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course to his associates in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, was arrested 20 April, 1389, as he was about to leave the city, and was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Bartolomeo Oleari, to be burned at the stake. He died chanting the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a>, while his followers, unmolested by the authorities, exhorted him to remain steadfast (30 April, 1389). To the end he maintained that <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had become a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> by his four <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>; that he and his successors had forfeited the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> supporting them could absolve validly.

<p>We have unmistakable evidence that several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> followers of Clareno were in the territory of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1362. Louis of <a href="../cathen/05209a.htm">Durazzo</a>, a nephew of Robert, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, maintained a number of Fraticelli in a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> adjoining his castle, Monte Sant' Angelo, and attended their services. These Fraticelli were divided into three <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>: those acknowledging Tommaso da Bojano, former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01662b.htm">Aquino</a>; the followers of the pretended minister general, Bernard of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; and those who claimed Angelo da Clareno as their founder and acknowledged only his successor as their general. All three <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> agreed in holding that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had ceased since the alleged <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, but the party of the minister general held it lawful to accept, in case of necessity, the ministrations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who adhered to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>.

<p>The "Poor <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a>" of Monte della Majella, near Sulmona, were also Fraticelli and adherents of Angelo da Clareno, and at one time afforded protection to the famous tribune of the people, Cola di Rienzi (1349). Fanatical as they were on the subject of poverty, they were, in accordance with ancient custom, sheltered by the Celestine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the near-by abbey of Santo Spirito. The origin of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Clareni, approved as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1474, is unknown; nor is it clear whether they were followers of Angelo who kept aloof from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or, after falling into his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, retracted.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The second main group of Fraticelli, chronologically considered, were the Spirituals who fled from <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and were surnamed at first the Rebellious Brothers and Apostates, but later the <em>Fraticelli de paupere vita</em>. It is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to apply the name <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards</a> to them. When, in 1309, the differences between the Relaxati and the Spirituals had reached a critical point, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> cited representatives of both parties to appear before the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> with a view to adjusting their disputes. The result of this conference was the Constitution "Exivi de Paradiso", enacted at the final session of the Council of Vienne (6 May, 1312). This Constitution contained an explanation of the Rule of St. Francis along stricter lines than those of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exiit qui seminat" of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (14 August, 1279), and justified the Spirituals in various matters. This proceeding, however, only provoked the Relaxati superiors to take energetic measures against the Zelanti. Towards the end of 1312 a number of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Spirituals deserted their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and took forcible possession of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Carmignano (near Florence), <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, and Asciano, putting the Relaxati to flight. About fifty, fearing punishment, fled to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, hearing of the insurrection, commanded the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to force them to return to obedience under penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. As nearly all disregarded this mandate, the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of San Fidele at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, who had been commissioned to execute it, declared them <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and placed their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> (14 May, 1314). Being also prosecuted by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, the rebels made a solemn protest against the violation of the rule on the part of the Community or <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> (7 July, 1313). As it soon became impossible for them to remain in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, they all fled to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where they were joined by numerous Zelanti from Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. King Frederick of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, brother of King James II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, admitted them after they had submitted their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> to his inspection. Fra Enrico da Ceva was now their leader. On 23 January, 1318, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Gloriosam ecclesiam", specifying five <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, to wit: (1) they designated the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> as carnal and corrupt, and themselves as spiritual; (2) they denied to the Roman <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> all power and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; (3) they forbade taking an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; (4) they taught that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could not confer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and (5) they asserted that they alone were the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> observers of the Gospel. At this time they had adopted a close fitting, short and filthy dress as their religious habit. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (15 March, 1317) admonished King Frederick to take severe measures against them. In a letter of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> addressed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to the entire <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, special stress was laid on the fact that the rebellious fugitives had elected a superior general, <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, and guardians. Banished from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where, however, some remained till at least 1328, they established themselves securely in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. On 1 August, 1322, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> issued a general <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against them, and after sending King Robert (4 Feb., 1325) the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> specially directed against Ceva, on 10 May, 1325, demanded their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at the hands of King Robert and of Charles, Duke of Calabria. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had to repeat this admonition several times (1327, 1330, 1331) to proceed against the Fraticelli and had renewed (5 Dec., 1329) the injunction laid down in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Gloriosam Ecclesiam". From this time onward the adherents of Ceva are hardly to be distinguished from those of the following group; they joined the Michaelites and used the same methods of attack against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The statement that some professed <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> may be based on fact, considering their situation and the local circumstances.
<h2 id="section2">II</h2>

<p>The third group of the Fraticelli are called the Michaelites, deriving their name from <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, their chief representative and natural leader. It must be premised that this name was in vogue during the fifteenth century and that the party it designated exerted great influence in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters on the other groups as early as 1329. It is to be noted also that shortly after this period it becomes difficult to differentiate these groups with anything like precision. The "theoretical" controversy about poverty carried on in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, or rather, carried on against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, gave occasion to the formation of this group. It is called "theoretical" to distinguish it from the "practical" controversy waged by the Spirituals relative to the practice of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> poverty which they wished to observe, whereas the leaders in the present conflict were former members of the Relaxati party and sworn enemies of the Spirituals (1309-22).

<p>In 1321 the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Inquisitor at Norbonne, John of Belna, declared <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the teaching of an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghard</a> of that region, who asserted that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles owned nothing either individually or in common. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, B&eacute;renger Talon, defended the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghard</a>. As he refused to retract and was threatened with punishment by the inquisitor, B&eacute;renger appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The matter soon developed into a general controversy between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; among the latter, Relaxati and Zelanti alike supported B&eacute;renger on the basis of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, "Exiit qui seminat". In that <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> had defined the poverty of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, both individually and collectively, as equivalent to that of the Apostles, and had therefore transferred to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> all their holdings in land and houses, as had already been enacted by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (14 Nov., 1245). The prohibition of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> to discuss this point was revoked by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in a new <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Quia nonnunquam" (26 March, 1322). On 6 March of the same year <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had submitted the matter to a consistory. The order was vigorously defended by the Cardinals Vitalis du Four and Bertrand de Turre (de la Tour), Archbishop Arnaldo Royardi of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, and various other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, all <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> opposed their views, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> leaned towards the opposition. He also requested the opinion of <a href="../cathen/15116a.htm">Ubertino of Casale</a>, a renowned Spiritual leader (1328), who, with a fine-spun distinction, declared (28 March, 1322) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles did possess <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, inasmuch as they governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but not as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or as exemplars of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. This distinction, more subtle than real, seemed satisfactory to both sides, when the provocative measures taken by the chapter of the order destroyed all prospects of peace. Fra <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, General of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> (elected 1316), a Conventual, as attested by various measures enacted by him with the approval of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, convened a general chapter for 1 June, 1322, at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. Anticipating, on the advice of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Cardinals Vitalis and Bertrand, the definitive decision of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the chapter solemnly declared in favour of the "absolute poverty" of Christ (4 June, 1322). This <em>pronunciamento</em> was signed by the general, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, the provincial <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of Southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (William of <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">Nottingham</a>, not Occam), Aquitania, Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and others, as well as by several renowned scholars. On 11 June the chapter solemnly published its decrees to all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Indignant at these proceedings, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad conditorem canonum" (8 December, 1322), declared that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> renounced all its claims to the movable and immovable properties of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> and therewith returned them. thus the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> revoked the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exiit" of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> and did away with the poverty which formed the basis of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. It is easy to understand the effect of this upon the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, particularly the Zelanti. In the name of the order Fra Boncortese (Bonagrazia) of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, a capable lawyer and up to that time a bitter enemy of the Zelanti, presented a daring protest against this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a> (14 January, 1323). Although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thereupon revised the text of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and reissued it under the original date, he incarcerated Bonagrazia and in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cum inter nonnullos" (12 November, 1323) declared <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the assertion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles possessed no <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> either separately or collectively.

<p>The controversy between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the order soon took on a political character, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> having been appointed counsellors to Louis IV the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who also was engaged in a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After Louis IV (1314-47) had defeated his rival Frederick, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, at the battle of M&uuml;hldorf (18 Sept., 1322), and had invaded <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> to further the cause of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> Visconti, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> ordered the whole question of right to the German throne to be brought before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> tribunal and, on 8 October, 1323, began canonical proceedings against Louis. In the <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> Appeal (18 Dec., 1323) Louis, curiously enough, had accused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of unduly favouring the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, though this document was never published. But the Sachsenhausen Appeal of the same King Louis (22 May, 1324) was full of invectives against the "<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who falsely designates himself <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>" for doing away with the poverty of Christ. This famous "Spiritualist excursus" is closely connected with the Appeal of Bonagrazia, and with writings of <a href="../cathen/15116a.htm">Ubertino of Casale</a> and of Pietro di Giovanni Olivi. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that it originated among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who, under the protection of the king, aimed it at <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and his teaching, although Louis IV later denied all responsibility in the matter. The result was that Louis IV was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> (11 July, 1324) and, in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Quia quorundam" (10 Nov., 1324), <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> forbade all contradiction and questioning of his constitutions "Cum inter nonnullos" and "Ad conditorem". The general chapter of the order, assembled at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (20 May, 1325) under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, forbade any disrespectful reference to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 8 June, 1327, Michael received instructions to present himself at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, a command which he obeyed (2 Dec., 1327). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> having sharply reproved him in public (9 April, 1328) for the chapter's action at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (1322), he drew up a secret protest (13 April) and, fearing punishment, fled, despite the orders of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to Aigues-Mortes (28 May) and thence to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, together with Bonagrazia of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a> and <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a>. In the meanwhile other events of importance had occurred. Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> had entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with a German army, to the great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>. Accompanying him were <a href="../cathen/15116a.htm">Ubertino of Casale</a>, John of Jandum and <a href="../cathen/09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a>, the authors of the "Defensor pacis", which declared that the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large were above the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Louis had himself solemnly <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Sciarra Colonna (17 Jan., 1328), and on 12 May he nominated and had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Pietro Rainalducci of Corvara, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, under the name of Nicholas V. The three fugitives from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> presented themselves to Louis and accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, where they remained till their death. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> deposed Michael as general of the order (6 June, 1328) and (13 June) appointed the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> Cardinal Bertrand de Turre <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the order to preside at the chapter to be held in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (2 June, 1329), which <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> vainly attempted to prevent, and brought about the election of <a href="../cathen/06468b.htm">Fra Gerardus Odonis</a> of Ch&#226;teauroux, of the province of Aquitaine. Obedient to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, he induced the majority of the order to submit to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> and all his adherents, the Michaelites, were repudiated by the order. At the same time, by command of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> proceedings were instituted against them everywhere. The Michaelites denied John's right to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and denounced both him and his successors as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. This shows the dangerous character of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In their numerous and passionate denunciations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, they always single out for refutation isolated statements of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. To the contention regarding poverty was added (1333) the question of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, concerning which <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, contrary to general opinion, yet without intending to define the matter, had declared that it would begin only at the last judgment.

<p>During this period the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Nicholas V, had nominated six <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (15 May, 1238), among them an Augustinian and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, and between September, 1328, and December, 1329, three other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; also among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> were members of the two orders mentioned above. After Louis IV had returned to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Nicholas V, deprived of all support, took refuge with the Count of Donoratico. Finally, in his distress, Nicholas appealed to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, cast himself at his feet (<a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 4 Aug.), and submitted to honourable confinement at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he remained till his death (16 October, 1333).

<p>John, meanwhile, had taken steps against Michael and his followers. In accordance with his instructions (20 June, 1328) to Aycardo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the proceedings against Michael were published in various localities. On 5 September, 1328, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of Fra Azzolino, who was acting as Michael's vicar, and on 18 August, 1331, the arrest of another vicar, Fra Thedino, who represented Michael in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>. Prominent among the followers of Michael were the more or less numerous <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> and Amelia (against whom proceedings were instituted in 1329-30), of <a href="../cathen/04401a.htm">Cortona</a> (1329), and of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (1330), where, however, they appeared openly as late as 1354, and at Albigano, and Savonna (1329-32).

<p>On 21 Dec., 1328, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> graciously pardoned Fra Minus, the Provincial of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, while on 2 Dec., he had ordered the trial of Fra Humilis, Custodian of Umbria. Papal decrees reveal the presence of Michaelites in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1329), <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1322), Carcassone, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1330), <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1329), <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> (1329, 1334), <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and other places. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and his immediate successors also issued numerous decrees against the Fraticelli in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and minor <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> barons defended them stubbornly and succesfully in spite of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> threats; also in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and Calabria, where King Robert and Queen Sanzia exhibited special veneration for St. Francis and his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> followers. In the royal castle, where the chaplaincies were held by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, there resided Fra Philip of Majorca, a brother of the queen. This Philip had (1328) petitioned <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> for permission for himself and other <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to observe literally the Rule of St. Francis, independently of the superiors of the order; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of course refused. In a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 August, 1333, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to settle some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of the queen relating to the observance of "holy poverty", and the king had even composed a treatise favouring the views of the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (1322). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> condemnations of the Fraticelli, therefore, had produced but slight results in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. On 8 July, 1331, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> admonished King Robert to withhold no longer the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees against <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> nor prevent their publication in his kingdom. Philip of Majorca, however, preached openly against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was due to the influence of the royal family that Fra Andrea of Galiano, a court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, was acquitted in the process instituted against him at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1338, as he still continued his intercourse with <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> and with the fifty Michaelites who resided for some time under the king's protection in the castle of Lettere near <a href="../cathen/03408a.htm">Castellamare</a>, but who later (1235) humbly submitted to their lawful superiors. In 1336 "short-robed" Fraticelli still occupied the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Santa Chiara at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, founded by Queen Sanzia, and were established in other parts of the kingdom; their expulsion was demanded (24 June, 1336) by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (1334-42). In 1344 <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> (1342-52) found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to reiterate the earlier decrees. Between 1363-1370 it at last became possible for <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to take possession of several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Calabria and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> from which the Fraticelli had been expelled; but <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> complains (12 Sept., 1372) that the "ashes and bones of Fraticelli were <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and churches were even erected in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>".

<p>From the records of a process (1334) conducted in irregular form against the Fraticelli of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Tauris, who had been reported by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, we learn that they inveighed openly against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and upheld the views of <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, although in their apocalyptic manner they declared that the order of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> was divided in three parts, and that only those would be saved who would journey to the East, i.e. themselves. It is uncertain whether these were identical with the Fraticelli in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and other oriental localities, where all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were commanded by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> to prosecute them (29 May, 1344).

<p>For a long time the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> prospered exceedingly in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> on account of the continual political turmoil. In a process instituted against a particular Umbrian group of Fraticelli in 1360, we are informed that Fra Francesco Niccol&#242; of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> was their founder. They pretended to observe the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, but were fanatical on the question of poverty and regarded all <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> as guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Salvation was to be found only in their, supposedly perfect, order. They imitated the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> Fraticelli in their doctrines and methods of instruction. An interesting letter is still extant which the Fraticelli of the Campagna (1353-55) wrote to the magistrates of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a> when they heard that one of their number (Fra Stefano) had been cruelly <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> of that city twelve or fifteen years before. In this letter they petitioned the magistrates to liberate him according to the example of the cities of "Todi, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>".

<p>The Fraticelli enjoyed complete liberty in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. They lived where it best suited them, principally in the country-houses of the rich. They became so bold as to publicly insult the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> (Conventuals) in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Francesco al <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>. It appears that these Fraticelli had elected their own <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and generals, and that they were split into various factions. The <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, as their one means of defence, called in Fra Paoluccio of Trinci, the founder of the Observants, and ceded to him the small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on Monte Ripido near the city (1374). Fra Paoluccio was successful in his disputations with the Fraticelli, and when they had been clearly exposed as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the people drove them from the city. It should be noted that these Fraticelli, and probably all the others of that period, were designated <em>Fraticelli della opinione,</em> perhaps on account of their opinion that the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had ceased to exist with <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1323) or Celestin V, and that they alone constituted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. About this time Fra Vitale di Francia and Fra Pietro da Firenze exercised a sort of generalship over the Fraticelli. They received protection and hospitality from rich and influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in Apulia, around <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in the March. One of their protectors was the knight Andreuccio de Palumbario, who sheltered them in his castle near <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, for which he was sharply called to account by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (4 May, 1388). On the same day the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a> was reprimanded for a similar fault. On 14 November, 1394, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> empowered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> of Terra di Lavoro to take possession of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> deserted by the Fraticelli. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> conceded the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the Roman Province (14 November, 1418) and, on 7 April, 1426, transferred to them as a special grant the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, which had been a stronghold of the Fraticelli. In the same year <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> nominated St. John Capistran (27 May) and St. James of the March (11 October) as inquisitors general to take action against the Fraticelli. These promoters of order among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their office strictly and energetically and succeeded in striking at the very vitals of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In 1415 the city of Florence had formally banished the "Fraticelli of the poor life, the followers of Michelino of <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a> of infamous memory", and in Lucca five Fraticelli, on trial, had solemnly <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (1411). <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> also ordered the Bishops of Porto and Alba to take steps against all Fraticelli "in the Roman province, the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and other localities" (7 June, 1427). On 27 January of the same year, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> had permitted the Observants of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> to occupy the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Fraticelli at Castro l'Ermita as a first step in the campaign against the Fraticelli of that neighbourhood. On 1 June, 1428, he commanded the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> to enforce his rulings strictly in Maiolati, to put all suspects to the rack, destroy their village, separate the children from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and disperse the elder population. A circular letter, which the Fraticelli addressed to all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christiandom</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> ineffectual and their doom was sealed. John of Capistrano and James of the March burned thirty-six of their establishments or dispersed the members and a number were burned at the stake at Florence and <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Fabriano</a>, at the latter place in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. St. James of March, commissioned by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> to proceed against them (1449), wrote the famous "Dialogus contra Fraticellos", which he first published in 1452, making some additions to it later on. According to this the main establishments of the Fraticelli were situated in the valley of <a href="../cathen/08372a.htm">Jesi</a>, at Maiolati, Poggio Cupo, Massaccia, and Mergo. They had also constituted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in other districts where there were a sufficient number of adherents. They made frequent journeys for propaganda purposes, especially in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Some dressed partly as <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, some as <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, often disguising themselves for the sake of protection. Their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of their former sectarian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>: the whole <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> had deserted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith since the time of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1323); they alone constituted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church and retained the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>A form of Fraticelli was also represented by Philip of Berbegni, a fanatical and eccentric Observant of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1433), who attempted to establish a strict <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> <em>de la Capuciola,</em> but met vigorous opposition from John Capistran, who issued a dissertation against him.

<p>Only once again are measures known to have been taken against the Fraticelli, viz., in 1466, when a number of Fraticelli from Poli, near <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, and Maiolati were captured at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> during the Portiuncula celebration. They were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the castle of Sant' Angelo and proceedings instituted against them. Their protector at Poli, Count Stefano de' Conti, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, but they also received the protection of the Colonna <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>. Tradition also mentions that the Fraticelli established many other colonies and that they had an important centre in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, whence they sent out emissaries and where they sought refuge from the aggressive measures of St. James of the March. They generally held their reunions at night in private houses and half of the inhabitants of Poli are said to have been among their adherents. The allegation that their religious services were defiled by immoral practices cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. According to their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as contained in the "Dialogus", immoral <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> incurred the loss of the powers of order and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. They had also their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Nicholas by name.

<p>During this period numerous pamphlets were published controverting the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Fraticelli. While the campaign was going on at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, information was brought concerning another <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> similar to the Fraticelli, which had been discovered in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; but though these visionaries, led by Brothers Johann and Livin of Wirsberg, found adherents among the Mendicants in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Franconia, they cannot be considered as Fraticelli. In spite of all persecutions, remnants of the original Fraticelli still survived, but their strength was crippled and they thenceforth constituted no serious danger to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The foregoing sketch sufficiently proves that these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were not members of the Order of St. Francis, but rather that they had been expelled from the order and from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The order as such and in the great majority of its members remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in spite of the fact that many prominent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and even whole sections fell away.
