<h1>Frederic Nausea</h1>  

<p>(Latinized from the German <em>Grau</em>.)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, born c. 1480 at Waischenfeld (<em>Blancicampium</em>) in Franconia; died 6 February, 1552, at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. He was the son of a wagonmaker and received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and probably at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> under John Cochl&aelig;us; with Paul of Schwartzenberg, canon of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, he pursued <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a>, juristic, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and later at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, there obtaining degrees in Law and Divinity. <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bologna and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, employed him as secretary and as such Nausea was at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> (1524), at the convention of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, at the Diet of Ofen, and for a time at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1525 he accepted the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Bartholomew at Frankenfort-on-the-Main and the dignity of canon, but was soon <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave on account of the intrigues of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> who even excited popular riots against him. He came to Aschaffenburg and (1526) to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> as preacher of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He attended the Diet of Speier (1529) and was chosen counsellor and preacher (1534) at the court of King Ferdinand. On 5 February, 1538, he was named coadjutor to John Faber, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, succeeding him in 1541. Nausea laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and together with other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, asked <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to permit the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to marry and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to use the <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">communion cup</a>. He also advised Cologne or <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> as the place for holding the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">General Council</a>. He was prevented from being present at the opening of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> by contrary orders from the king, but met <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> (1546) and there gave him his "Sylv&aelig; Synodales". When the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council</a> was reopened at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> in 1551 Nausea was present, taking an active part in its deliberations, especially on the Sacraments. Only a short attendance was granted him, for he died there of a fever. His body was brought to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>In the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council</a> Nausea is praised for his great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, his exemplary virtues, and his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> convictions (Theiner, "Acta genuina Conc. Trid.", I, Zagreb, 1874, 652). Among his writings are: "Distichs" on the works of Lachantius; "Ars Poetica"; sermons and <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on evangelical virtues, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, the life of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; "Catechismus cath." (Cologne, 1543); "Pastoralium inquisitionum elenchi tres" (Vienna, 1547); "On the Resurrection of Christ and of the dead" (Vienna, 1551); etc. For a full list see Metzner (<em>Fr. Nausea aus Weissenfels</em>, Ratisbon, 1884).
