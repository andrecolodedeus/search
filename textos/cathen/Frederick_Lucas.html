<h1>Frederick Lucas</h1>  

<p>A member of Parliament and journalist, b. in <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, 30 March, 1812, d. at Staines, Middlesex, 22 Oct., 1855. He was the second son of Samuel Hayhurst Lucas, a <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> corn-merchant who was a member of the Society of Friends. Educated first at a <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quaker</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Darlington, then at University College, London, he gave early <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his abilities, particularly in essay-writing and as a speaker in the college debating <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Even at this time he was an ardent supporter of Catholic Emancipation, which was then being much discussed. On leaving college he began to study for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in 1835. Staines in 1838 showed that he felt that attraction to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> which was then influencing so many <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. Yet ruled by the prejudices of his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> it was to the Oxford School rather than to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that he was first led. But early in 1839 an end was put to his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> and difficulties: his intimate friend <a href="../cathen/01551b.htm">Thomas Chisholm Anstey</a>, himself a recent convert, persuaded him to examine the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claims, and the perusal of <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner's</a> "End of Controversy" convinced him of their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Father Lythgoe, S.J. In a letter to the Kington monthly meeting of Friends he resigned his membership of the Society and announced his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (18 Feb., 1839). In 1840 he married Miss Elizabeth Ashby of Staines, who, like two of his brothers, followed him into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>In the same year he determined to start a weekly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, "The Tablet", the first number of which appeared on 16 Mays 1840. After two years his original supporters, Messrs. Keasley, failed in business, and he was left without the resources <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for continuing the paper. But he had many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> friends who put great confidence in his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, ability and broad scholarship, and they came to his assistance. A claim on the part of the printers, which he regarded as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, led to a struggle between him and them for the possession of the premises, and during the year 1842 rival publications were issued &mdash; the "Tablet" by the printers, and the "True Tablet" by Lucas. By the end of the year he was victorius, and in January, 1843, he was able to begin the fourth volume of the "Tablet" without a rival. He conducted the paper on such fearless lines that he alarmed some of the old <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who had been trained in a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the utmost <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and circumspection, and who looked askance at the uncompromising boldness with which he asserted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and defended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position. He received, however, the hearty support of many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with whose political aspirations he was thoroughly in sympathy. This led him in 1849 to transfer the publishing offices of the "Tablet" from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and from this time forward he took a keen interest in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> politics.

<p>Returned to Parliament in 1852 as one of the members for Meath, he quickly won for himself a position in the House of Commons, and was recognized as one of the leading <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> politicians. Questioning the sincerity of some of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Nationalist members he did not shrink from denouncing them, and before long he became involved in a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Dr. Cullen</a>, who prohibited his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from interference in politics. Lucas attacked this action of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the "Tablet", and in 1854 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to lay his case before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> received him kindly, and requested him to draw up a memorial on <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> affairs and the differences between himself and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Though in failing health he set about this task, which occupied him through the winter. In May, 1855, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> hoping after a few weeks to go back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but his health grew worse and he died on 22 October in the house of his brother-in-law at Staines. His death was regarded as a public loss by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> both in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who realized that he had breathed a new spirit of independence into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism and set an example of high principle in political life. "As a father, a husband, a journalist and member of Parliament he had a high ideal of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> &mdash; an ideal such as rarely, if ever enters into the minds of ordinary men" (Life, II, 468).
