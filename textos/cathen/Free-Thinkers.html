<h1>Free-Thinkers</h1>  

<p>Those who, abandoning the religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and moral dictates of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Revelation</a>, and accepting no dogmatic teaching on the ground of authority, base their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> on the unfettered findings of reason alone. Free-thought, of which they make a profession, is an exaggerated form, though a quite <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> development of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of private judgement in religious matters. The free-thinker holds such principles, whether of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or of action, as he is persuaded he can prove; and he gives assent to no others. He is a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a>. But since the persuasion of having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (or of being able to prove) even the doctrines of natural religion by reason alone varies <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> with the individual, it is difficult, save on the most general lines, to class free thinkers together. This difficulty is apparent in the case of the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a>, to whom the appellation was characteristically applied in the latter end of the seventeenth century. They all agree however, in refusing to accept the doctrines of an authoritative <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; and it is on this negative ground that their position is most clearly defined.

<p>Although the words "Free-thinker" and "Free-thought" first appeared in connection with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a> [Collins, "Discourse of freethinking occasioned by the Rise and Growth of a Sect called Freethinkers" (1713), gives the deistical tendency this name], "the phenomenon of free-thought has existed, in specific form, long before it could express itself in propagandist writings, or find any generic name save those of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> or Infidelity" (Robertson). Taken in the broad sense in which Robertson here uses it, the term would seem to include the reactionary movement against any traditional form of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to which men were expected to assent. In this sense it is possible to speak of free-thinkers of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> or <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or, indeed of any considerable body that can impress its teaching upon the multitudes. There were undoubtedly, to a certain extent at any rate, in classical times those who either publicly scoffed at the authoritative myths of their country's religion or philosophically explained their meaning away. So &mdash; but this in a truer sense &mdash; in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there were to be found <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a>, or free-thinkers, among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> had met <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> with its own weapons and argued against the falsehoods with the help of the natural reason. The early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were free-thinkers in their rejection of the regulating authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> upon points connected with their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which they elaborated frequently upon <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> lines; and the pantheists and others of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> criticized and syllogized revelation away in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> free-thought style. Both were in consequence condemned; but the spirit of excess in criticism and the reliance on the sufficiency of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> are as typical of the free thought of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> as that of the twentieth century.

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a> onwards, free thought has undoubtedly gained ground among the masses. Originally the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> excess of the learned and the student, and rarely leaving the study in a form in which it could be expected to be at all popular, it began with Annet and Chubb (see <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>) to become vulgarized and to penetrate the lower strata of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Its open professors have apparently been less numerous than its adherents. Some stop short in a negative position, claiming no more than autonomy for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> or philosophy they represent. Others carry on a bitter and unscrupulous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against religion. It is apparent in the various branches of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and criticism, as well as in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and though it generally pretends to a scientific plan it makes use of a priori methods more than posteriori ones. One of its most dangerous forms, which generally ends in pure religious skepticism, can be traced to the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> distinction between noumenal and the phenomenal. But its main positive positions are the denial of prophesy, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> and inspiration, its rejection of all external revelation (including obviously <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority), and its assertion of the right of free speculation in all rational matters. On this latter frequently follows the negation of, or suspension of judgement with regard to, the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> (<a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a>), and the denial of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being susceptible of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and the rejection of freedom of the will. Among the principal free-thinkers may be mentioned Voltaire, Thomas Paine (the Rights of Man), Renan, Ingersoll, Strauss (Leben Jesu), Haeckel, Clough, and Holyoake.
