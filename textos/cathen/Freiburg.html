<h1>Freiburg</h1>  

<p>City, <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a>, and university in the <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Archduchy of Baden, Germany</a>.
<h2>The city</h2>

<p>Freiburg in Breisgau, the third largest city in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, is beautifully situated at the foot of the Schwarzwald mountains on both banks of the Dreisam. The census of 1 December, 1905, gave the number of its inhabitants as 76,286, of whom 53,133 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The city was founded in 1120 by Conrad, a member of the Swabian House of Z&auml;hringen, which rules in Baden even to this day. According to the original city charter, which is still in existence, the city was from the beginning a market or commercial centre, and all the privileges then enjoyed by the citizens of Cologne were granted to the merchants and other citizens who settled in Freiburg. It became a flourishing town even during the lifetime of its founder. In 1146 <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> there. It appears that under Berthold IV (1112-1186), Conrad's successor, the erection of a Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun. After the death of Berthold V (son of preceding), Freiburg was inherited by his brother-in-law, Count Egon I of Urach. The consort of Egon II (1218-36) induced the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers to settle in Freiburg, and founded at Adelhausen the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a>, renowned in the history of German <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Among the famous <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> connected in some degree with Freiburg were <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and John of Freiburg, while Berthold the Black (der schwarze Berthold), the supposed inventor of gunpowder, was a member of the local <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The city took advantage of the pecuniary embarrassment of its lords to purchase important <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberties. Ludwig of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, whom the city assisted in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Frederic the Fair, confirmed (1339) by a <em>Bulla Aurea</em> (golden charter) all the concessions and privileges of Freiburg and granted it an independent municipal court. A serious quarrel arose between the city and Count Egon IV (1358-68), but in 1368 the count gave up all his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to Freiburg, and the city placed itself <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> under the suzerainty of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and for more than five centuries it shared the fortunes of the House of Hapsburg.

<p>As early as 1247, the municipal council calculated the inhabitants to number 4000, and at the end of the fourteenth century the town contained 1778 buildings, twenty of which were <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In 1393 the council was composed of 12 nobles, 12 merchants, 18 guild-masters, and 6 specially elected members of guilds. In 1415, Freiburg which had given refuge to <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">Pope John XXIII</a> (April 10-16) after his flight from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, was made a free imperial city (<em>freie Reichsstadt</em>), but was reconquered by the Austrians in 1425. In 1456, Archduke Albert founded its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (see below). The city was afterwards made the seat of government for Hither <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and attained to a high degree of prosperity, especially during the reign of Maximilian I. Many <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> edifices were built, some of which still adorn the city; the famous minster (<a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>) was decorated with fine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/02220b.htm">Hans Baldung</a>, its choir being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1513. The diet of the empire met here in 1498.

<p>The great social and religious disturbances of the sixteenth century exerted a most detrimental influence on the prosperity of the city. In 1524, the rebellious peasants surprised the castle on the Schlossberg, captured the city, and forced the inhabitants to pay tribute. The city council and citizens in general had little sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and, although the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> found some adherents in the beginning, its propagation was effectually hindered by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, the city council, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (see ULRICH ZASIUS). IN 1529, Freiburg became the residence of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Basle, driven from that city by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02338a.htm">BASLE-LUGANO</a>). In spite of repeated epidemics, the sixteenth century was considered on the whole a prosperous period for the city. The <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> brought with it much suffering. Freiburg was besieged five times, captured four times and lost about two-thirds of its population by contagious diseases. Hardly had the city recovered from these disasters, when <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> began his predatory <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> on <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1677, Freiburg was taken by the French and converted into a formidable fortress by Vauban. In the course of this transformation, 14 churches and 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were demolished. The French supremacy lasted only a short time, and Freiburg was restored to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by the Peace of Ryswick in 1697. On two later occasions it was held by the French for a short time, in 1713-14 during the War of the Spanish Succession (1744-48). These two <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> destroyed the prosperity of the city so completely that in 1754 the number of its inhabitants sank to 3655, of whom at least one third were in a state of beggary.

<p>Hardly had Freiburg begun to flourish again under <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> and <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, whose reform measures were executed partly in the Breisgau, when the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> broke out. By the treaty of Campo Formio (1787), Freiburg and all Breisgau was ceded to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, but a little later, by the Treaty of Pressburg (1805), it reverted to the house of Z&auml;hringen. The city <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> allegiance to the new Archduke of Baden on 30 Jan., 1806. The new government immediately abolished most of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, or converted them into <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. It abolished also the ancient representative system of the "estates", or the three ranks of the social order (Clergy, nobles, bourgeois). In 1821, Freiburg became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of the newly-founded province of the Upper Rhine (see <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">BADEN</a>), and in 1827 the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. In the revolution of 1848-49, Freiburg played an important part, becoming at its close the seat of the provisional revolutionary government. Since then the city has flourished wonderfully; the number of its inhabitants has increased from 25,000 in 1872 to nearly 80,000 at the present time (1909), and its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is attended by 2900 students.



<p>Freiburg is the residence of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine, and is the seat of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, and of one of the deaneries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Including the recently incorporated suburbs, the city has now 7 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> curacy (<em>Pfarrkuratie</em>), 22 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 68 priests; 17 institutions of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Sisters of Charity (212 members); 4 houses of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Charity (39 members); 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Sisters of Charity of the Holy Cross (61 members); a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residential gymnasium; a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> high school for girls, etc. The most prominent among the numerous <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> conducted by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sisterhoods are: St. Joseph's Hospital; St. Charles' Home (for pensioners); St. Ann's Home, for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> engaged in business; St. Mary's Home, for servant girls, with employment bureau; St. Francis' Home for the aged; St. Elizabeth's Home (house-keeping and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>); Home for Apprentices and Journeymen, etc. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sisters are also in charge of a number of institutions belonging to the municipality, for example the Hospital of the Holy Ghost, the Home for Beneficed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">Clergymen</a>, the <em>Kartause</em> (poor-house), the People's Kitchen, the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> in G&uuml;nterstal, and the large clinical <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> connected with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. They also conduct two kindergartens, four industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, two house-keeping <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and five <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for small children.

<p>The minster, one of the few existing Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, completed in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, ranks first among the city churches. Its oldest parts, the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> and the intersection of <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, were constructed during the thirteenth century in Romanesque style. The new part (Early Gothic) was begun in 1250, when the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the tower (380 feet) was laid, and was completed in the fourteenth century. In 1354, the choir (Late Gothic) was begun, but operations were suspended in 1370, and resumed only after a lapse of one hundred years. In 1513, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was practically finished. The minster is rich in art treasures, of which the most notable are: the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> over the main altar by <a href="../cathen/02220b.htm">Hans Baldung</a> (1511-17); the choir-chapel with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by the elder Lucas Cranach and <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Hans Holbein</a> (the Elder and the Younger); the artistic windows in the side-aisles, dating in part from the fourteenth century; lastly the decorations in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> with an aggregate of over 200 figures, one of the most elaborate examples of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> symbolism and popularly attributed to <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>. Among the other churches are: St. Martin's (Gothic) erected for the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, renovated and ornamented with a tower, 1876-93 (Hansjakob, St. Martin zu Freiburg im Breisgau als Kloster und Pfarrei, Freiburg, 1890); the University church (1630-40), erected by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (Baroque) and used by the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>, 1875-94; the church of the Sacred Heart, erected 1892-97 (Later Romanesque and Rhenish Transition style); St. John's (1894-99); St. Michael's Chapel in the old cemetery (1744), the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of which is decorated with a remarkable <a href="../cathen/04617a.htm">"Dance of Death"</a>.
<h2>The archdiocese</h2>
<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>It includes the <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Grand Duchy of Baden</a>, the Hohenzollern possessions of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Crown, bounded by Baden and <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, together with some few places in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is 1,263,280, according to the census of 1905. The suffragans of Freiburg are the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is elected by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, but the names of the candidates must be submitted to the sovereign, who has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to cancel the names of candidates not acceptable to him, provided that a sufficient number remain on the list to allow a choice. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of the dean [at present (1909) the <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> Dr. Fr. Justus Knecht, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nebo], 6 canons and 6 <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>. The ordinariate consists of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the members of the chapter, of 2 other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The ordinariate is the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> court; the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> court is termed the officialate (6 members). The <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> is administered, partly by the ordinariate and partly by the civil body known as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Oberstiftungsrat" at Karlsruhe (see <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">BADEN</a>). The pastoral work of the archdiocese is carried on by two incorporated <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Freiburg and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Sankt Peter), and by 43 deaneries (4 in Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen), with 911 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> curacies (Pfarrkuratien), 116 chaplaincies and 165 other pastoral charges.

<p>In January, 1909, the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of the archdiocese consisted of 904 rectors and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, 281 <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and vicars, 106 other active <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (professors, teachers, editors, etc.), 107 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> retired or on leave of absence: a total of 1398, besides 80 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in the former <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sankt Peter; the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Freiburg, whose students frequent the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; and the 5 <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> gymnasia of Freiburg, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Rastatt, Tauberbischofsheim and Sigmaringen. In the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, eleven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and professors of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and their lectures were attended in the summer-semester of 1909 by 224 students.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>The foundation and history of the archdiocese have been treated exhaustively under <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">BADEN</a>; also, the relations between the Church and the State (II, 195-200). It only remains to add a few remarks concerning the Hohenzollern section of the archdiocese.

<p>The two principalities, Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, which formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, were joined to the Archdiocese of Freiburg, when the province of the Upper Rhine was created by the <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> of 18-27 Oct., and 14-21 Nov., 1821. Both princes had pledged themselves to carry out the Josephist principles which then prevailed in the other states of the Upper Rhine province, though they were the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns of the province and reigned over an almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Both governments consequently exercised all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> and Josephinism claimed for the secular government as its inalienable <em>jus circa sacra</em>, and restricted <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority as much as possible. The <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">"Regium Placet"</a>, or civil control of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and episcopal decrees, was rigorously enforced. Taxes and contributions for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and "foreign" <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors were prohibited; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was held subordinate even in spiritual matters to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was placed in a position of administrative equality with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and even episcopal acts were subjected to the most scrutinizing supervision and arbitrary control of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> (jus suprem&aelig; inspectionis). The government, especially in Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, sought to secure a predominating influence in matters concerning divine worship, marriages (by introducing the Josephist matrimonial legislation), the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, appointments to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, and the administration and employment of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Furthermore, it compelled the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and confraternities to contribute to the support of higher and elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The Hohenzollern princes, however, were well disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, hence these pretensions of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> were enforced much less rigorously in their principalities than in the Baden section of the archdiocese and other parts of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine.

<p>The innovations of <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a> (<a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, and, until 1827, acknowledged as such by both Hohenzollern and <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> governments, despite the protests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>) affected the liturgy, processions, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, confraternities, the number of holidays of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and included the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> into the Mass and also the so-called <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> confession and communion. To the credit of the Hohenzollern princes, it must be said that they hindered rather than promoted these innovations, which are so alien from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In various other ways, also, these princes were helpful to the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They assisted the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to bring up a moral and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, regulated by decrees the observance of Sunday, strove in union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to suppress immorality, made a strong stand against the pietistic movement which originated in the Haigerloch deanery, and opposed the spread of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> book entitled "Stunden der Andacht" (Hours of Devotion). They also bound the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to give <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction regularly in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In general, however, though no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was used to enforce the principles of Josephinism, the activity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in many ways restricted and paralyzed; her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, above all, were greatly interfered with. The wrongs committed in this respect were so great that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, most of whom had been brought up in the principles of <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> and Josephinism, and many of whom favoured the abolition of the breviary and of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, presented an unavailing petition to the government in 1831 for gentler treatment.

<p>The situation became more favourable, when in 1849 these two principalities were by treaty annexed to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> under King Frederick William IV. Thanks to the king's friendly disposition towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the untiring efforts of Archbishop Hermann von Vicari, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Hohenzollern soon secured the same liberties as those then allowed to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was permitted to erect <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and to re-establish fraternities. Missions were again held, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> became more popular and a general revival of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> took place. Unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, though originating in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, was also felt in Hohenzollern, now part of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Kingdom, although the so-called <em>May Laws</em> and other persecuting enactments were not enforced there so strictly as in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> proper. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Beuron, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Gorheim near Sigmaringen, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Stetten near Hechingen were suppressed; the teaching sisters, the <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> (Ingenbohl) were expelled. It was forbidden to appoint or install any more <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, etc. Two temporary rectors of churches, appointed in spite of this prohibition, were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and Lothar von K&uuml;bel, after Vicari's death administrator of the archdiocese for 14 years, was heavily fined for appointing <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to vacant <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were deprived of the right of local school-inspection, but, in virtue of an old law (1809), were permitted to give religious instruction. At the close of the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, better relations were developed between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, and continue in general to the present day.
<h2>The university</h2>

<p>For the foundation of its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> Freiburg is indebted to Archduke Albrecht VI of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who was entrusted by his brother, Emperor Frederick III, with the government of the Further Austrian territories. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was first conceived by Mechtild, the accomplished wife of Albrecht, and it was at her suggestion that he resolved to found the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, having obtained the sanction of <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 20 April, 1455. The revenue of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was ensured by the foundation of several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and the incorporation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Freiburg, together with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Breisach, Ensisheim, and other places, in the new institution (Deed of 28 August, 1456), this endowment being approved by Frederick III. The town also made considerable contributions, although the foundation-brief of 21 September, 1457, granted the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> its own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and immunity from taxation for its members. The real work of organization and the preparation of the constitution fell on the erudite Matthaeus Hummel of Villingen, and it was entirely due to his untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> could be opened with seven lecturers (four being <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>) on 26 April, 1460. Matthaeus was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> elected in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, and, despite the initial modesty of the institution and the fewness of its lecturers, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was attended during the first year of its academic existence by two hundred and fourteen students (including one hundred and eight <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>), the majority of whom were from the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, from <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and Lorraine.

<p>The supreme authority over the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was vested in the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, who was elected by the professorate for a single term. In the preservation of academical discipline, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was assisted by the senate (also called the consistory or regency), which usually comprised the preceding <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and three counsellors. Of the four faculties at the "Albertina", the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> was the most important. The course usually lasted three years, and included <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, dialectics, physics, mathematics, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and the peripatetics, poetry and oratory being added in 1471 and Greek in 1521. The most important lectures of this faculty during the first century of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university's</a> existence were: <a href="../cathen/12731a.htm">Gregorius Reisch</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, the teacher of <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a> and author of the "Margarita Philosophica", which treated of the totality of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at the time; Jacob Locher, called Philomusus, who translated Brant's "Narrenschiff" (Ship of Fools) into Latin; Philip Engelbrecht of Engen (Engentinus), a poet and a secret follower of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; Henricus Loriti, called <a href="../cathen/06577a.htm">Glareanus</a>, the renowned Latinist, musician, and geographer; John Hartung, professor of Greek and Hebrew. In the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, which usually employed three lecturers in the sixteenth century, taught (at least for a short period) the following eminent scholars: <a href="../cathen/06403c.htm">Geiler of Kaisersberg</a>, one of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university's</a> earliest students; <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a>; <a href="../cathen/10645a.htm">Thomas Murner</a>; <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> of Rotterdam, who had however never studied there, etc. The faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to which six regular professors were assigned in the sixteenth century, was long famous throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, thanks to <a href="../cathen/15752d.htm">Ulrich Zasius</a>, the founder of modern political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. At this period three professors constituted the medical faculty, whose <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> had been sketched by Hummel himself. As a rule the students lived with their professors in residences or boarding-houses (the so-called <em>Bursen</em>), of which there were seven at Freiburg, including the "Alte Burse", the "Domus Carthusiana", and the "Collegium Sapienti&aelig;". The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> having attained so rapidly to renown, it was but natural that many of its professors should have been appointed to offices of high <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> importance. From Freiburg the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> chose two, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> three of its prince-bishops; the Chapters of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Basle, and Speyer many of their suffragans, and the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> one of its chancellors.

<p>During the widespread confusion of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period which exercised so deleterious an effect on many of the German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, Freiburg succeeded by its judicious and cautious attitude in maintaining its ground. It is indeed a fact that several of its professors were in correspondence with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>; that many others were suspected of favouring their innovations; that the senate itself censured <a href="../cathen/06577a.htm">Glareanus</a> for inveighing so fiercely against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/11213a.htm">&OElig;colampadius</a>, and the other reformers in his lectures; still the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in general remained true to the ancient Faith, and through its influence the town became a bulwark of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> refused henceforth to enrol any students who had studied in <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> or Leipzig, and after 1567 only those who declared on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> their acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> Confession of Faith were admitted. To secure a still more <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> atmosphere, Archduke Ferdinand invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1577 to found a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Freiburg, and to incorporate it in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. This scheme, however, aroused such energetic opposition, especially from Jodocus Lorichius, professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and founder of the Collegium Pacis (<em>Burse zum Frieden</em>) that it had to be laid aside. On 5 November, 1520, shortly after the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> on the strength of a fiat of Archduke Leopold in spite of the opposition of the senate, and entrusted with the whole <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> and temporarily with two of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> chairs. From the rectorship and qu&aelig;storship, however, they were excluded, although the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> was soon resigned into their hands. The most renowned of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> professor at Freiburg was the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, <a href="../cathen/13526a.htm">Christopher Scheiner</a>, who left Freiburg finally in 1630. The frequent change of the fathers was indeed injurious to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, at which too many remained but a very short time; thus, in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> alone, no fewer than 123 different <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were employed as lecturers during the 153 years preceding the suppression of the order.

<p>The seventeenth century, especially the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> and the predatory <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, brought the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the brink of ruin. Almost all its funded <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was lost, as well as a great portion of its income from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, now sadly impoverished by pillage and fire. The professors were frequently compelled to wait years for their stipend, and in 1648 the number of students had fallen to 46. Emperor Leopold was the first to take steps to remove the financial difficulties, but, when the town was ceded to the French by the Peace of Nimwegen (1679), the majority of the professors and students migrated to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> remained and opened in 1684 a <em>studium gallicanum</em> under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, but it was not until some years later that the old personnel of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> could initiate academic courses in <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. After the Peace of Ryswik (1697), the professorate returned from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> to Freiburg, when the old contentions, which had so often broken out between the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, were settled by the so-called "Viennese Transaction" of forty articles. According to this agreement, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were still excluded from the rectorate, and were refused the precedence, which they had claimed; on the other hand they received the building of the "Alte Burse", which they had previously occupied, as their private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and in addition an increased annual stipend, as well as all arrears of salary.

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century the outlook of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was far from hopeful, and in 1713 the members were compelled to secede once more to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, returning in 1715. Emperor Charles VI later increased the revenue of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, whose staff again included many illustrious professors &#151; the jurists <a href="../cathen/14248c.htm">Stapf</a>, Egermayer, Waizenegger, and Reinhart; the physicians Blau, Strobel, and Baader; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Nicasius Grammatici and Steinmayer &#151; but the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> never reached the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> level of the halcyon days of the sixteenth century. After the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773, their college buildings together with their church (built 1630-40) and <em>Gymnasium Academicum</em> were annexed in 1777 by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The importance of the Albertina waxed greater with the increasing prosperity of the country. The new curriculum of studies, which <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> caused to be drawn up for the higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of her dominions, was introduced into Freiburg, in 1767, and at first met with much opposition. Although this action of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> led to the withdrawal of many of its ancient privileges (e.g., its governmental independence), it paved the way for a more intimate connexion between the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the government, and from this period dates the adoption of a more reasonable attitude by both parties.

<p>The transformation of Further Austrian Breisgau to the House of Z&auml;hringen by the Peace of Pressburg (1805) seemed to menace greatly the position of Freiburg, since the new inconsiderable State of Baden possessed already in Heidelberg an older and more famous <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts of the professors and town of Freiburg, however, their <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was retained, and in 1807 the elector himself accepted the office of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. Since then, the sovereign has always been "rector magnificentissimus" of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and confirms the annual election by the ordinary professors of the pro-rector to exercise the office of rectorship in his name. In 1816 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was again threatened with dissolution, but the danger was obviated principally through the influence of Karl von Rotteck. The independence of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was, however, seriously curtailed, and the curriculum reformed after the model of Heidelberg, for which purpose the revenue, which had fallen very low, was increased by a annual State grant amounting at first to 15,000 gulden. The attendance varied between 270 and 320 students. In 1818 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> sent one representative to the newly-created diet, at which von Rotteck, the historian, was its deputy for many years. In consequence of the opposition between the professors and the town, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was closed in 1832 for a short period, of which the government took advantage to recognize the previous republican constitutions on a more oligarchical basis. The retention or relinquishment of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was also the subject of debate; indeed, for thirty years the danger of dissolution lay ever threatening. The Revolution occasioned a brief closing of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in May, 1849. In 1857 the solemn celebration of its 400th anniversary was held in the presence of the sovereign. The efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party to restore to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> its initial purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character by securing for the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, not alone a deciding voice in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professors, but also a certain right of supervision over the other faculties, were rendered ineffectual through the rejection of the concordat between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the government by the Diet of Baden in 1859. Since then the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> both in its professors and in its students, who are recruited mainly from North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, have become gradually impaired. When, after the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, a new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was founded in <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, a serious decay of Freiburg was anticipated. Fortunately these forebodings proved to be groundless, since, while the number of students in 1872 was only 272 &#151; a figure which does not exceed the attendance during the first century of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university's</a> existence &#151; it exceeded 1000 in 1885, 1500 in 1898, 2000 in 1904, and 2600 in 1908, thus placing Freiburg fifth in the list of German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> as regards attendance.

<p>Of the many scholars, who shed a lustre on the name of Freiburg at the close of the eighteenth and during the nineteenth centuries, the following (excluding those still living) may be mentioned; the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> Engelbert Kl&uuml;pfel, Johann Leonhard <a href="../cathen/07515a.htm">Hug</a>, Heinrich Schreiber, historian of the town and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Freiburg, <a href="../cathen/14302a.htm">Alban Stolz</a>, the renowned popular author, and Franz Xaver Kraus, who wrote on the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>; the jurists Jodocus Riegger, Johann Caspar Ruef; the statesman <a href="../cathen/03088a.htm">Joseph Buss</a>, Gustav R&uuml;melin, who for many years represented the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in the first diet; the philologists and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, Johann Georg Jacobi and Anton Baumstark; the physicians and scientists, Alexander Ecker, Adolf Kussmaul, Alfred Hegar, Anton de Bary.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Freiburg at present contains four faculties: that of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, that of medicine, and that of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the last-mentioned being subdivided into philological-historical and mathematico-physical. At the beginning of 1909, the teaching staff consisted of 140 lecturers: 11 <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, 16 jurists and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">political economists</a>, 50 physicians, 43 in the first division of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty and 30 in the second. In the summer term of 1908 Freiburg was attended by over 2600 students, and in the winter term (1908-09) by 1966 matriculated (including 67 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>) and 153 private students. Of the sixty institutions connected with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> the most important are the large medical infirmaries (surgical, gyn&aelig;cological, psychiatrical, optical) and general clinical <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; the physical, geological, botanical, and zoological institutes; the academical reading-rooms. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> contains 300,000 volumes, a large number of which belonged to the old cloister-libraries, and 700 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The majority of the institutes possess excellent special <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> consists partly of invested capital to the value of 1,300,000 marks (about 300,000 dollars), and partly of unremunerative capital (e.g., the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> buildings, etc.) to the value of 2,800,000 or, allowing for certain outstanding liabilities, 2,380,000 marks. According to the budget of 1908-09, its income was 1,075,300 marks, of which 958,500 was paid by the state. The expenditure, which equalled the income, was as follows: 475,600 marks for salaries of regular professors and officials; 132,200 for the extraordinary staff; 335,900 for the different institutions, and the remainder for sundry expenses.
