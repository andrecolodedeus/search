<h1>Freiherr Max Von Gagern</h1>  

<p>Born at Weilburg (in Nassau), <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 25 March, 1810; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 17 October, 1889. He was the son of Hans Christoph von Gagern, minister of state in Nassau; he attended the gymnasiums at Kreuznach, Mannheim, and Weilburg, and studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> from 1826 at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, and G&ouml;ttingen. After a stay at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he received in 1829 a position in the cabinet of William I, King of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. At the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> revolution (1830) he joined the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> army as a volunteer and took part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. In 1833 he retired from the service of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, married Franzina Lambert, of <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, and took up historical studies in order to fit himself for the position of <em>Privatdozent</em> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> University. He was at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> during the years 1837-40. In 1837, although still a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, he sided with the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (see DROSTE-VISCHERING), and thus lost the favour of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government. In 1840 he was appointed ministerial successor with the title of <em>Legationsrat</em> by the Duke of Nassau. On 28 August, 1843, he joined the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Although naturally very religious he had grown indifferent to religion during his student life and his residence in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. The more he realized the seriousness of life the stronger grew his religious needs. Acquaintance with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and with the historian George Frederick B&ouml;hmer, who was friendly to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, awakened in him respect and veneration for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The chief sources of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were, as he himself says, the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> by <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, the study of M&ouml;hler's "Symbolik", and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. His conversion did not affect the favour of the Duke of Nassau who appointed him in 1844 extraordinary envoy to the Courts of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.

<p>Von Gagern's labours during the revolutionary year of 1848 extended far beyond his native state. He was the centre of the efforts that aimed to mediate between the Government and the people and to reorganize the German Confederation as a nation. According to the schemes <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was to have the supreme direction of German affairs. With this end in view Von Gagern negotiated with the Governments of Southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. he then took part in the debates of the preliminary parliament at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and at the same time was one of the seventeen confidential agents of the Governments who were to aid the parliament of the Confederation in revising the constitution. He was chosen president of this committee of seventeen, but was not as prominent at the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> as his brother Heinrich whom he supported. He joined the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Club. On 5 August, 1848, he was made under-secretary for foreign affairs in the imperial ministry which Archduke John, as administrator of the empire, had temporarily formed. In the question as to the constitution of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he worked with his brother for "little <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>" (exclusion of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, union of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> under a <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> empire). When the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> declined the imperial crown offered to him and the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> approached dissolution, Von Gagern and his party withdrew from the assembly.

<p>In 1850 Von Gagern was again in the service of the State of Nassau, being employed as an upper ministerial clerk. He had, however, lost the confidence of the duke by his "Little <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>" policy, and influential circles looked upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> unfavourably. In 1854, after having been conspicuously slighted, he retired from the state service. His efforts to obtain a historical professorship at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> failed owing to the dislike of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> for converts to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. During the years 1855-73 he was in the service of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, first as head clerk in a ministerial department, then as departmental head in the mercantile political division of the ministry of foreign affairs. From 1860 he had also charge of the department of the press for foreign affairs, a position which gave him a deep insight into <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> policy without, however, leading to an independent position. In 1881, eight years after his retirement on a pension, Emperor Francis Joseph made him a life member of the upper house of the imperial Austrian Parliament. His rich <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts, his honourable character, unselfish nature, and kindliness were recognized even by his political opponents. He was in addition genuinely religious, and loyally supported <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests whenever possible.
