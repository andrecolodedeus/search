<h1>French Catholics in the United States</h1>  

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, the Right Reverend Louis de Goesbriand, in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 11 May, 1869, and which appeared in "Le Protecteur Canadien", a French newspaper then published at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, made the following statement: "I am convinced from positive information, that when we say that there are 500,000 <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the figures are far below the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." The sources from which the late <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> drew his information are unknown to the writers of this article, but it is a fact that today the <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Diocese of Burlington</a> has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 76,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, of which 50,000 at least are of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> birth on origin. It is also a fact that the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> element has increased, both naturally and by immigration, to such an extent that it now numbers nearly 1,200,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> that it has made its influence felt throughout the Eastern States, in all walks of life, and furthermore that, in point of numbers, it is the predominant element in several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and an important part of the population in many others. However, except in their own newspapers, or a few little-known books, scarcely anything had been said of the part taken by these immigrants in the civil and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of their new country, until, very recently, they took into their own hands the task of reviewing their history, of gathering statistics of their numbers, and of recording their achievements and the progress they have made in fifty years. The task is still far from complete, but enough has been done to demonstrate the progress of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> and their devotion to their Church and to their adopted country.

<p>The immigration of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> began before the War of American Independence (1775-83). <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> had then already immigrated to New England, and we find them in large numbers in the armies of Washington. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the American Congress, in recognition of their services and to prevent their being prosecuted in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> on the charge of high treason, gave them land on the shores of Lake Champlain, where their descendants are still to be found. That concession of land, situated in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, has long been known as "the Refugees' Tract". In 1837, after the rebellion in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, a new immigration to the Eastern States took place, to the <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">State of Vermont</a>, more particularly, where the "Patriots", vanquished in battle, sought refuge with their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. But the chief influx from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> took place after the Civil War. Notwithstanding the fact that they had at that time but few organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> were here in sufficient numbers during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to furnish 40,000 soldiers to the Union. The immigration at the close of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> has been ascribed to many causes, the most considerable of which are the unprecedented industrial prosperity that followed the Civil War and the inborn <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> for travelling, together with the desire to earn the high wages and to share in the vast opportunities which the Republic offered to its citizens.

<p>Some writers &#151; and many of these in earnest &#151; have given as the principal cause of this <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigration, three-fourths of which took place between 1865 and 1890, the necessity in which the farmers of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> found themselves of seeking a new home after leading a life of luxury and dissipation. Undoubtedly this was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of some, but the general moral character of the hundreds of thousands who crossed the border is the best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cause of this movement must be sought elsewhere. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Hamon, writing on this subject, does not hesitate to say: "The rapidity with which this immigration was accomplished, and the ease with which these <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> transplanted into a foreign land, have immediately reconstructed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mould of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> that made their strength in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; the energy shown by them in erecting churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, in grouping themselves together, and in organizing flourishing congregations, supported within by all that nourishes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, protected without against pernicious influences by the strength of association, and a press generally well inspired; all these elements of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life, organized within a quarter of a century in the very citadel of old <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritanism</a>, seem to indicate a Providential action as well as a Providential mission, the importance of which the future alone will reveal."

<p>Those who do not look higher than material considerations in studying the causes of national movements will not give much credence to this opinion of Father Hamon. Nevertheless it is today a fact recognized by noted economists, that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, now better known in the Republic under the name of French Americans, are, as labourers and artisans, the most solid and reliable pillar of industry in New England. And New England has received within its borders, more than two-thirds of their total immigration. As <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, it is obvious that they have played a role no less important, as may easily be seen by the perusal of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Directories. Father Hamon classifies the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigration as temporary, fluctuating, and permanent. Figures show the relative importance of each of these classes and demonstrate the spirit which animated the whole movement. The temporary immigration comprised a class of farmers who came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with the avowed intention of going back to their old homes as soon as they had saved enough money to clear their farms from mortgages and all other financial incumbrances. This class became less numerous from day to day; so much so, that it was practically unnoticeable, as early as 1880. In many cases the intention of returning to the old home was never carried out, Frequently this class, by revealing to their neighbours the opportunities offered across the border, induced many of them to follow in their footsteps. As to the fluctuating immigration, only a mere mention is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Always on the move, from one country to the other, from city to city, from mill to mill, those who formed this class led that kind of life which relies, as Father Hamon says, on the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a> for its support. This roving class is still less numerous than the temporary group, and it is to be found not only in all classes of newcomers, but in settled populations as well. The permanent immigration has been the most numerous, and, naturally, the most substantial. It is these permanent <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigrants who have organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, erected churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and now constitute the labouring power <em>par excellence</em> in all the industrial centres of New England. Most of them, if not all, came from the rural districts of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, especially from the Eastern townships, from the Dioceses of Trois Rivi&egrave;res and Rimouski, and from the Counties of Beauce, Bellechasse, and others on the borders. Their farms had become insufficient to support large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; in the Eastern townships their titles to the land they occupied were disputed, and they were forced to give up the fruit of many years of labour; they were the victims of the indifference shown by their Governments, both Provincial and Federal, towards colonization and the opening up of new farming districts. The increasing population was thus compelled by circumstances, to look elsewhere, for more land and greater opportunities. At the same time, the reports sent home by those who had taken part in the earlier immigration had widely advertised throughout the whole <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, the material advantages of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. This migration was called at the time "the desertion of the Fatherland". But those who spoke thus were forgetful of the historical fact, that the French of America have from the very beginning felt perfectly at home in the whole northern part of the continent, on the soil of which their missionaries, their <em>coureurs des bois,</em> explorers, and warriors have left their footprints broadcast. In spite of all opposing efforts, hundreds of thousands of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, most of them farmers, between 1870 and 1890, left their rural occupation to adopt the more arduous life of the New England factories and the various industries of the Western States. This movement took place quietly, slowly, without creating any disturbance, and almost unnoticed. It was, in a certain sense, a repetition of that other movement which, advocated by Horace Greeley, sent toward the Golden Gate so many young men of the East.



<p>Doubtless, this depopulation on a large scale was a great loss to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where the emigrants might have founded <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of colonists. But the nature of this emigration was such that it could not be checked by any special legislation. The movement had set in, and it was too late to forestall an event prepared by many years of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions misunderstood or wilfully ignored. The stream had found its way across the borders, where new industries, phenomenal opportunities, and advantages unheard of before, were ready to absorb and utilize this new and valuable power of production.

<p>In order to present a strictly accurate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the importance of the French American element, both numerically and from a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standpoint, the following sources of information have been used for this article:-- <ul><li>(1) The Twelfth Census of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (1900); <li>(2) Local enumerations made in New England since 1900, and as late as the present year (1908); and <li>(3) The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Directory of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.</ul>

<p>The accompanying table, compiled from the first of these three sources, shows, first, the number of French Americans born in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and, secondly, this first class combined with those of whom at least one parent was born in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>The figures given for Louisiana are, of course, exclusive of all other inhabitants of French extraction; those relating to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> are exclusive of the large population of immigrants from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> established in that State, more especially in the city of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>. There were also, 115 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> parentage in <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>, and 4 in <a href="../cathen/13438a.htm">Hawaii</a>, besides 502 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the same parentage in the military and naval service of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, stationed abroad and not credited to any State or Territory. Combining with these small figures the totals for the five divisions given in the last column of the table, we get the grand total of 810,105 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> parentage living under the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Flag. But these figures only represent the first and second generations, i.e. original immigrants still living, and their immediate descendants. In this connexion the director of the census says: "A small number of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> reported as of foreign birth, are themselves of native parentage, so that, to a very small extent, the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of foreign birth reported at each census is not included in its entirety in the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> reported as of foreign parentage. The figures are sufficiently comparable, however, to show the large body of population which must be added to the foreign born element itself in order to ascertain, even approximately, the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of foreign extraction at any of the census periods considered. Moreover, this is the best figure that can be given as expressing the element of our population which is of foreign extraction, as the census inquiry does not go beyond the immediate <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> enumerated, and it is impracticable, at least under present conditions, to endeavor to determine the origin of the people beyond a single generation."

<p>It is obvious, that an inquiry which does not go beyond the immediate ancestors of each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> enumerated cannot convey an exact <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the real number of those who may still be distinctly classified as French Americans, even though both of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> may have been born in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. And when it is remembered that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> were early settlers in the northern part of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, that they were, practically, the first settlers of the <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">State of Maine</a>, and had found their way into <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a> as early as 1830; that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> were the pioneers of the Western States, where they founded, or assisted in founding, great cities like <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, and Detroit, it is not difficult to understand that in certain parts of the country at least three generations of French Americans have been recorded by the census of 1900 as native whites of native <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. How far short of the actual number of French Americans are the figures of the National Census, may be estimated by considering the local enumerations taken in the New England States since 1900, with the following results:--

<table summary="Table" border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0> <tr><td>Maine<br>New Hampshire<br>Vermont<br> <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a><br>Rhode Island<br>Connecticut<br><strong>Total</strong></td> <td align=right>91,567<br>84,011<br>58,217<br> 366,879<br>76,775<br><u>&nbsp; 46,083</u><br> <strong>723,532</strong></td></tr></table>

<p>These figures, compared with the total (508,362) of those given in the Census of 1900 for the same six States, show an excess of the local over the national enumeration of 215,170 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or more than 42.3 per cent, for New England alone. This excess, explained in part by the fact that the census inquiry of 1900 was limited to only two generations, is also attributable to the continuous flow of immigration and in greater measure to the large birth-rate which is still maintained among the French Americans, it having been scientifically established that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> &#151; at least in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> &#151; double their numbers by natural increase every twenty-six years. Taking into consideration the increase (42.3 per cent) shown by the enumerations in New England over the figures given by the National Census, and also bearing in mind the fact that the figures quoted above do not include the French from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (reported as being 265,441 by the census of 1900) and the French-speaking <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>, scattered throughout other States than those of New England, we may conclude that the French Americans in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> today number more than 1,500,000, of whom nearly 1,200,000 can be classified as of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> extraction. As this immigration of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> was almost exclusively an immigration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, we are led to inquire what provisions were made for them in the different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> had left behind them in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> a perfect <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organization, with <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> flourishing in all parts of the province, with <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in Quebec, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, and the West &#151; an organization comprising today many ecclesiastical provinces with <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, both <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of the highest order. It was not to be expected that the immigrants should find in their new country the religious organization they had possessed in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Nevertheless, they had to be provided for, and it became a serious problem for the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, of New England especially, to determine how these newcomers should be cared for spiritually. The question of language stood in the way from the very beginning. The <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, though willing to become staunch Americans, did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the English language, and even when they had learned it, they still preserved a strong attachment for their mother tongue. That this problem puzzled the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of New England, is shown by the time taken for its solution, and by the fact that in some instances they were reluctant, or often unable, to deal with the situation in the only proper way, which was, to give to these people <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own tongue and nationality. Even today this problem is not adequately solved. It was feared at the beginning, as it is feared now in some quarters, that to grant to the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigrants <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own tongue and nationality would encourage them to form a sort of state within the state, thereby causing great harm to the nation as a whole. Time has shown the fallacy of that argument. The patriotism of the French American element is undisputed. They possess the sterling civic qualities desirable and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to promote the best interests of the republic. As a matter of fact, the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigration has created no new state in the state; and the French Americans have willingly learned the English language while remaining as closely attached as ever to their mother tongue, in which they see the best safeguard of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>The progress accomplished for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and country through the organization of French American <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> all over New England is the conclusive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their excellency from every standpoint. It proves, at the same time, that further progress, religious and patriotic, can be accomplished by pursuing the same policy. At first, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to call <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. That policy, inaugurated in the <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Diocese of Burlington</a> in 1850, by the lamented Bishop de Goesbriand, has proved to be a blessing wherever it has been carried out. These early <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> missionaries, of whom many are still living, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their people, understood their character and customs, had the same mentality as their flock, and easily succeeded in organizing flourishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> entirely devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As early as 1890 Father Hamon notes that these newcomers already possessed 120 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, ministered to by <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 50 large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, affording <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to more than 30,000 children. Let us recall a few dates which mark the beginning of this new impulse given to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The first French American <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> after the foundation of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, was that of St. Joseph, at <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, founded 28 April, 1850, with the Rev. Joseph Qu&eacute;villon as first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In the same state, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the Nativit&eacute; de la Sainte-Vierge, at Swanton, was organized in 1856, and that of St-Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier at Winooski, in 1868. In the <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Diocese of Springfield</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Notre-Dame du Bon Conseil, at Pittsfield, was organized in 1867. In all, 22 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were organized by French Americans from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to 1890, besides 15 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of mixed population, wherein the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were associated with their English-speaking brethren. In the <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Diocese of Providence</a>, R. I., the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St-Jacques, at Manville, was organized in 1872, that of the Pr&eacute;cieux Sang, at Woonsocket, in 1873, and that of St-Charles, at <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, in 1878. In the <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Diocese of Hartford</a>, Conn., the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St-Laurent, at Meriden, was organized in 1880, and five other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> between 1880 and 1889. In the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Diocese of Boston</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St-Joseph, at Lowell, was organized in 1869, and that of Ste-Anne, at Lawrence, in 1873. In the <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Diocese of Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St-Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales, at Waterville, was organized in 1869, that of St-Pierre, at Lewiston, in 1871, that of St-Joseph, at Biddeford, in 1872, and that of St-Augustin, at <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, in 1888. In the <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Diocese of Manchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of St-Augustin, at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, and St-Louis, at Nashua, were organized in 1872. Similar results were accomplished in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse</a>, and in the Western States. The accompanying table shows the actual religious organization of the French-American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in New England &#151; their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, etc.

<p>To complete these figures for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> would necessitate a study of all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, as there are French Americans in every state and territory of the Union; a few statistics, however, of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of French extraction in the principal <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> will help to give a more definite <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the organization as a whole: Baltimore has 21; <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 62; Albany, 19; <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 14; San Francisco, 3; New York, 25; <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, 5; Philadelphia, 3; Dubuque, 7; Milwaukee, 9; <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, 96; <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse</a>, 5; and Ogdensburg, 63.

<p>Of the distinguished <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> whose names are associated with the work already described, the following have already been called to their reward: <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Norbert Blanchette</a>, first Bishop and first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> City; J. B. Lamy, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santa F&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>; <a href="../cathen/02593b.htm">Monsignor Magloire Blanchette</a>, Prothonotary Apostolic of Walla Walla, Washington; the Rev. P. M.  Mignault, of Chambly, Quebec, who in the fifties was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Diocese of Boston</a>, with the special mission of caring for the spiritual needs of his compatriots in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; the Rev. Joseph Qu&eacute;villon, of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, Vermont; Monsignor Brochu, of Southbridge, the Rev. J. B. Primeau, of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, the Rev.

Mention should also be made of the Right Rev. Bishop Michaud, lately deceased, whose father was a French Acadian, and who had been for many years at the head of the <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Diocese of Burlington</a>, proving himself a worthy successor to Bishop de Goesbriand. Among the living there are scores of others who have been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pioneers of the Faith, and to whom is due great credit for having so well organized a new and loyal membership of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Recently one of their number has been elevated to the <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">See of Manchester</a>. <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Right Rev. George Albert Guertin, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 19 March, 1907.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have been worthy co-labourers with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the building-up of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. To them have been entrusted the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children and the care of the sick and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. This mission has been especially well fulfilled in the French American <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the sisters and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the brothers are the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> complements of the church itself. One does not go without the other, and as a rule the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is built before the church and is used for a church also. The number of members in the different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is given in the accompanying table.

<p>Besides their religious work, vast and praiseworthy as it is, the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigrants have also displayed industry and activity in other walks of life, and in their closer relations with their fellow-citizens they have shown qualities and traits found only in the best of citizens. In other words they have stood well up to the standard in the body politic and in many ways have exercised over their surroundings an influence for the general good of the community such as to fully justify, at least so far as it refers to them, the statement made by Vice-President Fairbanks, that in the American Nation "flows the richest blood that courses in the veins of all the peoples in all quarters of the globe." In fifty years, they have built up a press that is not surpassed, from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> point of view, by that of any other group of immigrants in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. That press is composed today of seven dailies &#151; "L'Ind&eacute;pendant", of <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Fall River</a>, Mass.; "L'Opinion Publique", of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Mass.; "L'Etoile", of Lowell, Mass.; "La Tribune", of Woonsocket, R.

H.; one semi-weekly "Le Jean-Baptiste", of Pawtucket, R. I.; and the fifteen weeklies &#151; "L'Union", of Woonsocket, R. I., official organ of L'Union St-Jean-Baptiste d'Am&eacute;rique; "Le Canado-Am&eacute;ricain", of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, N. H., official organ of L'Association Canado-Am&eacute;ricaine; "La Justice", of Biddeford, Maine; "La Justice", of Central Falls, R.

I., and "Le Citoyen", of Haverhill, Mass. These newspapers are thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in spirit, as well as sincerely American. Their editors and publishers met in convention, at Woonsocket, R. I., on 25 September, 1906, and organized the Association des Journalistes Franco-Am&eacute;ricains de la Nouvelle Angleterre. At that meeting they adopted resolutions asserting their loyalty to the republic, and advising the French Americans to show themselves <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and sincere American citizens, to promote naturalization, to preserve their mother tongue, to learn the English language, to maintain <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, wherein both languages should be taught on an equal footing, and to ask for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own nationality to be their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. The resolutions also requested the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to appoint, when feasible and proper, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their nationality, familiar with both the English and French languages, in all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in which the French Americans constitute the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. The first French newspaper to appear in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was "Le Courierde Boston", which was published weekly during a period of six months in 1789, the first number appearing on 23 April, and the last on 15 October. The editor and publisher was Paul Joseph Gu&eacute;rard de Nancr&egrave;de, later a bookseller and stationer at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and instructor in French at Harvard University from 1787 to 1800. The next French American newspaper was published in 1825, at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, under the title of "La Gazette Fran&ccedil;aise", which issued only four numbers. In 1817, the Detroit Gazette published a French column during four months and then abandoned the venture. The second French American newspaper in New England was "Le Patriote", published at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, in 1839. Since that time nearly 200 newspapers published in the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> have appeared and disappeared, leaving only those mentioned above.

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> American activity, while effectively applied to the enterprises of religion, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and the press, has not neglected provident organizations. The first French institution of this kind was the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Jacques Cartier, founded in <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, in 1848, while the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; St-Jean-Baptiste of New York, organized in 1850, is still in existence. In 1868 they had 17 benevolent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and since then they have organized more than 400 others, of which about 142 are still in existence. Moreover they have established federations, which have more than four hundred and fifty councils or branches, with thousands of members. To these organizations are due, in a great measure, the existence and prosperity of the most of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Many of them have inserted in their by-laws articles recommending naturalization. To obtain membership in any one of them the applicant must, in all cases, be of French origin and a practising <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The local <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which still survive are distributed among the different states as follows: <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 62; Vermont, 18; <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, 25; Maine, 12; Rhode Island, 11; Connecticut 14 &#151; making a total of 142. It was in 1900 that, in response to the acknowledged need of a central organization embracing all the groups of the French race in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the Union St-Jean-Baptiste d'Am&eacute;rique was organized, with headquarters in Woonsocket, R. I., through the federation of a considerable number of the local <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. This move has proved to be a very wise one, as is shown by the rapid growth of the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which has enrolled over 19,500 members in eight years. The Association Canado-Am&eacute;ricaine of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, established in 1896, has a membership of over 11,000 and is working along the same religious and patriotic lines. In 1906, a new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the Ordre des Forestiers Franco-Am&eacute;ricains, was formed by the secession of a few thousand members from the Foresters of America, and it now comprises 40 courts. All the French American <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, with the exception of the Forestiers, give life insurance, and, without exception, they provide for sick benefits. Millions of dollars have been distributed by them to the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> of their members and to their sick fellow-members. The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Artisans Canadiens-Fran&ccedil;ais, though a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Society, and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; L'Assomption, a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of French Acadians drawing the greater part of its membership from the maritime provinces, also have members in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and are therefore included in the accompanying table, which shows the number of councils or courts and the membership of the four national <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in New England.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and in 1905 the Union St-Jean-Baptiste d'Am&eacute;rique and L'Association Canado-Am&eacute;ricaine were instrumental in organizing the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Franco-Am&eacute;ricaine du Denier de St-Pierre, whose sole object is to collect funds for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Historique France-Americaine, incorporated under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">State of Massachusetts</a>, was organized at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1899, "for the purpose of encouraging the careful and systematical study of the history of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and especially to bring forth in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light the exact part taken by the French race in the evolution and formation of the American people". With this end in view this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has met regularly twice a year since its organization. Noted American historians and writers, as well as several from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, have delivered before it addresses which have contributed in no slight measure to enrich the store of French American historical literature. Another organization which seems destined to play an important role, at least among the French Americans of tomorrow, is the Association Catholique de la Jeunesse Franco-Am&eacute;ricaine, which was formed at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 4 January, 1908, by twenty-two young French Americans who were students in various <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of that city. This organization aims first of all to form <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sons of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and useful citizens of the American Republic. Piety, study, and action constitute its threefold motto. Its first congress, held at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 23 and 24 August, 1908, was attended by delegates from circles formed in different New England localities.

<p>Besides the admirable work they have accomplished by means of their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, press, and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and in order to render their efforts more effective, the French Americans have held at different times conventions called for various purposes. The first of these gatherings, destined to promote the interests of the mutual benefit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> then existing, and held under their auspices, took place at <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, in 1865. Thereafter similar conventions were held annually, the year 1877 excepted, until 1881, as follows: 1865, New York; 1869, Detroit; 1873, Biddeford, Maine; 1866, New York; 1870, <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, Vermont; 1874, New York; 1867, Troy; 1871, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Mass.; 1875, Glens Falls, N. Y.; 1868, <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, Mass.; 1872, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Ill.; 1876, Holyoke, Mass.; 1878, Troy, N. Y.; 1879, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Mass.</a>; 1880, <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, Mass.; 1881, Lawrence, Mass. Since 1880 there have been six general conventions of French Americans, to which all the groups of this element, as well as all their <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, were invited to send delegates. These national gatherings took place as follows: 1880, <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, Mass.; 1882, Cohoes, N. Y.; 1884, Troy; 1886, Rutland, Vermont; 1888, Nashua, N. H.; 1893, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Ill. In October, 1901, delegates (to the number of 742) of the various groups and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of French Americans in New England and the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> met in a "Congress" at <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, Mass. The four great subjects of deliberation were naturalization, benevolent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and the religious situation, and the spirit of the numerous and forcible addresses made on these heads is fittingly and admirably reflected in the resolutions. This congress, undoubtedly the most successful gathering of French Americans held up to that time, appointed a permanent commission consisting of the president of the congress and two delegates from each state represented, authorizing it to take all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> measures for putting the resolutions of the congress into effect, and giving it the power to call another congress, local or general, according to its discretion.

<p>Besides these general conventions, others have been held at different times and places for the purpose of considering a particular question or the interests of the French Americans of a particular state or diocese. For instance, the French Americans of Connecticut have held eighteen conventions in the last twenty-three years. Political organizations have also flourished among citizens of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> origin, and naturalization clubs can be found in every city, town, or village where they are sufficient in number to maintain such institutions. In June, 1906, there was organized in the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">State of Massachusetts</a> the Club R&eacute;publicain Franco-Am&eacute;ricain, with headquarters at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, at the first banquet of which, in April, 1907, Hon. Charles J. Bonaparte, a member of the Roosevelt Cabinet, was the guest of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The French Americans, in 1890, had 13 representatives in the Legislatures of Vermont, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, besides numerous public servants in the city councils and the municipal administrations; in 1907 they elected senators in <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and Rhode Island; their representatives in New England numbered, in 1907, as follows :--

<table summary="Table" border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0> <tr><th>State</th><th>Represen-<br>tatives </th><th>Senators</th></tr> <tr><td>Maine<br>Massachusetts<br>New Hampshire<br>Connecticut<br>Rhode Island</td> <td align=right>5<br>6<br>18<br>2<br>4</td> <td align=right>2<br>1<br>. . .<br>. . .<br>2 </td></tr> </table>

<p>-- a total of 5 Senators and 35 Representatives. In many instances their candidates for high political honours have been successful at the polls. Such has been the case with the Hon. Pierre Broussard, Congressman from <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>; the Hon. Aram J. Pothier, of Woonsocket, R. I., elected governor of his state in November, 1908, after having been its lieutenant-governor and mayor of his city; the Hon. Ad&eacute;lard Archambault, also of Woonsocket, and who has likewise filled the offices of lieutenant-governor and mayor; Judge Joseph A. Breaux, of Louisiana; Pierre Bonvouloir, of Holyoke, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, whose service as city treasurer covers a period of fifteen consecutive years; Hugo A. Dubuque, of <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Fall River</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, ex-member of the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> Legislature, and city solicitor; Alex. L. Granger, of Kankakee, Ill., district attorney; Aim&eacute; E. Boisvert, of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, N. H., district attorney; and Arthur S. Hogue, of Plattsburg, N. Y., also district attorney. Studying an earlier period, we find the names of Pierre M&eacute;nard, first Lieutenant-Governor of Illinois; the Rev. Gabriel Richard, second Congressman from <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> (the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who ever sat in Congress), and Louis Vital Bougy, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Senator from <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. At the present time, prominent among those who serve the country abroad are the following French Americans: Arthur M. Beaupr&eacute; (Illinois), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>; Alphonse Gaulin (Rhode Island), Consul-general at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Eug&egrave;ne L. Belisle (Massachusetts), Consul at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Pierre P. Demers (New Hampshire), Consul at <a href="../cathen/13466a.htm">Bahia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>; Joseph M. Authier (Rhode Island), Consul at <a href="../cathen/07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>, West Indies.

<p>In civil life, belonging to the generation departed for a better world, though their names are still present to the memory of their fellow-citizens and compatriots, were Ferdinand Gagnon, of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, the father of French American journalism; Dr. L. J. Martel, of Lewiston, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, his worthy associate in the advancement of the French American element in the New England Slates; Major Edmond Mallet, of Washington, D. C., recognized as an authority upon the history of the North-West, and whose <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (preserved intact by L'Union St-Jean-Baptiste d'Am&eacute;rique) is the largest and most complete collection of documents relating to the French Americans ever gathered; Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Houde and Antoine* Mousette, pioneer journalists; Judge Joseph LeBoeuf, of Cohoes, N. Y.; Pierre F. Peloquin, of <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Fall River</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and a score of others who for years had been foremost among their compatriots as champions of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, both civil and religious.

<p>To sum up, the record of the French Americans in their new country has been such that prominent men of native origin, writers and politicians of note, have sung their praise on more than one occasion. In this respect, one will readily remember the homage paid them upon different occasions by the late Senator Hoar, of <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, as well as the marks of high esteem shown them by governors and members of Congress. As recently as 20 March, 1908, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, speaking on "Immigration" before the Boston City Club, made the following statement: "Later than any of these (movements of immigration) was the immigration of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, but which has assumed large proportions, and has become a strong and most valuable element of our population. But the French of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> scarcely come within the subject we are considering, because they are hardly to be classed as immigrants in the accepted sense. They represent one of the oldest settlements on this continent. They have been, in the broad sense, Americans for generations, and their coming to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, is merely a movement of Americans across an imaginary line, from one part of America to another." In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the sentiment of hostility and suspicion, which rebuked the French Americans at their arrival in the republic, has subsided before their splendid conduct and magnificent spirit, and is replaced today by that tribute of respect which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> acknowledges as due, and never fails to grant, to men of talent, industry, generosity, and patriotism.
