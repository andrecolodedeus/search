<h1>French Congregation of the Oratory</h1>  

<p>Founded in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> at the beginning of the seventeenth century by <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal Pierre de B&eacute;rulle</a>, who, in <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> words, "made glisten in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the purest and most sublime lights of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life". It was precisely to work more effectively towards the rehabilitation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life that <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle</a> founded (in 1611) the new congregation, which he named after that of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, adopting also in part the rules and constitutions of the latter. To meet the special needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the period, however, and because of the tendency toward centralization which "especially from this period forms one of the dominant characteristics of the French national spirit" (Perraud), he made one very important modification; whereas in the Italian congregation the houses were independent of one another, <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">de B&eacute;rulle</a> placed the government of all the houses in the hands of the superior-general. On 10 May, 1613, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> approving the new institute, which now made great progress. During the lifetime of its founder, more than fifty houses were either established or united to the Oratory, subsequently there were more than twice this number divided into four provinces. As St. Philip had wished, so also the French Oratory was solely for priests; the members were bound by no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> except those of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and had for sole aim the perfect fulfillment of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions. The <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Congregation of the Oratory</a> is not a teaching order; <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> have directed many colleges, notably de Juilly; but neither this nor instruction in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> was ever the sole object of the congregation, though it was the first to organize <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> according to the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The congregations of M. Bourdoise, St. Nicolas du Chardonnet, Saint-Sulpice and Saint-Lazare were all inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle</a>. The definite aim and characteristic of the French Oratory is in the words of Cardinal Perraud "the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> perfection". The supreme authority of the congregation is vested in the superior-general (elected for life) and in the general assemblies convoked regularly every three years &#151; or extraordinarily immediately on the resignation or death of a general. These assemblies are composed of members who have been seven years in the congregation and three in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; the number of members is one out of every twelve <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> thus qualified, and they are elected by all Oratorian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> three years in the congregation. The general assemblies appoint all the officers &#151; a superior general (if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>), his three assistants, the visitors, the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general, and the secretary general. They also examine and decide upon all questions of any importance concerning the congregation in general; the general and his assistants, in the interval between the Assemblies, exercise only ordinary administration. The founder, who died at the altar in 1629, was succeeded by Father Charles de Condren, who, like <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Father de B&eacute;rulle</a>, was imbued with the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> from his youth. Even during his life, Saint Jeanne de Chantal wrote of him that "it would seem that Father de Condren was capable of teaching the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>"; <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul's</a> was wont to say that "there had never been a man like him". Father de Condren governed the Oratory most wisely, completing its organization according to the intentions of its founder. Among his works must be specially remembered the part he played in the institution of Saint-Sulpice, whose founder, the saintly and celebrated <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, was under his direction. He died in 1641; his remains, recovered by the present writer in 1884, are now preserved in the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Juilly. The succeeding generals were: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/02722a.htm">Bourgoing</a> (1641-62); <li>Fran&ccedil;ois Senault (1662-72), a celebrated preacher; <li>Abel-Louis de Saint-Marthe, who resigned in 1696, only to die the following year. During his generalship the congregation was greatly disturbed by the troubles of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. <li>There was the same disturbance under his successor, Father Pierre d'Ar&eacute;rez de la Tour (1696-1733), who began by appealing against the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and a large part of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Later however, having a better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the facts he revoked his appeal, and also obtained the submission of <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a> &#151; which shows that his difficulty was not a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> one, but arose rather from considerations of discipline and opportuneness. Many <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> have been <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> on this point by prejudiced or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> historians. Father d'Ar&eacute;rez de la Tour was one of the most esteemed spiritual directors of his time. <li>The seventh general was Father Thomas de la Valette (1733-72); <li>the eighth, Father Louis de Muly (1773-9), <li>the ninth, Father Sauv&eacute; Moisset (1779-90). </ul>

<p>On the death of this last, at the height of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, the congregation was unable to meet in a general assembly to elect a successor, and was soon engulfed in the revolutionary storm, which overwhelmed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; but, in dying, the Oratory again attested to its faithful attachment to the Chair of Peter. If some of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> at this time supported Constitutionalism, the great majority remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and a certain number among them paid for their fidelity by their lives.

<p>It was only in 1852 that the French <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Congregation of the Oratory</a> was restored by <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Father Gratry</a> and Father P&eacute;t&eacute;tot, the latter, who was earlier <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Saint-Roch de Paris, becoming first superior-general of the revived institute. In 1884 he resigned and was replaced by Father (later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Perraud. Father P&eacute;t&eacute;tot died in 1887. Father Perraud's successor, Father Marius Nouvelle, took charge of the congregation, which, greatly weakened by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which reigns in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, numbers only a few members residing for the most part in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>The French Oratory at various stages in its history has given a large number of distinguished subjects to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; preachers like <a href="../cathen/09142a.htm">Lejeune</a>, <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a>, and Mascaron; <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> like <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> like <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, Morin; <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> like <a href="../cathen/07498a.htm">Houbigant</a>, Richard Simon, Duguet. One must note, however, that the last two were forced to leave the congregation where they had been trained &#151; the former on account of the rashness of his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, the latter in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> tendencies.

<p>Naturally, the Oratory of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> exerted little direct influence in foreign countries. except through its houses, St. Louis-des-Fran&ccedil;ais in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. In connexion with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Father de B&eacute;rulle's</a> mission with twelve of his confreres at the court of Henrietta of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1625), wife of the unfortunate Charles I, must be remembered. Among the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> were Father Harlay de Sancy, Father de Balfour, the latter of an old <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12022a.htm">Father Robert Philips</a>, a Scotchman and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of great merit, who entered the Oratory in 1617 after having been tortured for the Faith in his own country. When <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> intolerance forced the other <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/12022a.htm">Father Philips</a> remained as confessor to the queen, and in 1644 returned with her to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died in 1647. Later other <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> joined the Oratory. Among the best known are: Father William Chalmers of Aberdeen (d. about 1660), who entered the Oratory in 1627, author of "Disputationes philosophicae" (1630) and an edition of various patristic works (1634). After leaving the Oratory in 1637, he published several other works, including "A Brief History of the Church in Scotland" (1643). Father John Whyte, of Loughill in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, entered the Oratory in 1647 and died a member in 1678. He was also a noted <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and published "Theoremata ex universa theologia" (1670). A still more distinguished member of this period was <a href="../cathen/06627a.htm">Father Stephen Gough</a> of Sussex. At first <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and doctor and Oxford, he was converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> of the court of Henrietta of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whom we mentioned above, and in 1652 entered the Oratory of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at the age of twenty-seven. The general of the Oratory, <a href="../cathen/02722a.htm">Father Bourgoing</a>, stationed him at Notre-Dame-des-Vertus, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at the head of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which he had founded, and for which the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> thanked the Oratory in a beautiful letter of congratulation. From 1661 <a href="../cathen/06627a.htm">Father Gough</a> lived in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as almoner of the Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He died of apoplexy in 1682, without publishing the commentary on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> with immediate reference to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversy, which he had been preparing for many years. In contrast to this illustrious convert is Father Levassor of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, who entered the Oratory in 1667. A man of ability, but, according to Batterel, "too fond of sport and good cheer", he ended by leaving the Oratory and apostatizing, and died in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1718, a canon in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church</a>.
