<h1>French Revolution</h1>  

<p>The last thirty years have given us a new version of the history of the French Revolution, the most diverse and hostile <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> having contributed to it. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Taine, drew attention to the affinity between the revolutionary and what he calls the classic spirit, that is, the spirit of abstraction which gave rise to <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesianism</a> and produced certain masterpieces of French literature. Moreover he admirably demonstrated the mechanism of the local revolutionary committees and showed how a daring Jacobin minority was able to enforce its will as that of "the people". Following up this line of research <a href="../cathen/04078b.htm">M. Augustin Cochin</a> has quite recently studied the mechanism of the <em>soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de pens&eacute;e</em> in which the revolutionary <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was developed and in which were formed men quite prepared to put this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> into execution.

<p>The influence of <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemasonry</a> in the French Revolution proclaimed by Louis Blanc and by <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemasonry</a> itself is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the researches of <a href="../cathen/04078b.htm">M. Cochin</a>. Sorel has brought out the connection between the diplomacy of the Revolution and that of the old regime. His works prove that the Revolution did not mark a break in the continuity of the foreign policy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The radically inclined historical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, founded and led by M. Aulard, has published numerous useful documents as well as the review, "La R&eacute;volution Fran&ccedil;aise". Two years since, a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> occured in this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, M. Mathiez undertaking opposition to M. Aulard the defence of Robespierre, in consequence of which he founded a new review "Les Annales R&eacute;volutionaires". The "Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'histoire contemporaine", founded under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> auspices, has published a series of texts bearing on revolutionary history. Lastly the works of Abb&eacute; Sicard have revealed in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> various tendencies, some legitimist, others more favourable to the new political forms, a new side of the history of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> being thus developed.

<p>Such are the most recent additions to the history of the French Revolution. This article, however, will emphasize more especially the relations between the Revolution and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">F<font size=-2>RANCE</font></a>).
<h2>Meeting of the estates</h2>

<p>The starting point of the French Revolution was the convocation of the States General by Louis XVI. They comprised three orders, nobility, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the third estate, the last named being permitted to have as many members as the two other orders together. The electoral regulation of 24 January, 1789, assured the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a large majority in the meetings of the <em>bailliages</em> which were to elect <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> representatives to the States General. While chapters were to send to these meetings only a single delegate for ten canons, and each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> only one of its members, all the cur&eacute;s were permitted to vote. The number of the "order" of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at the States General exceeded 300, among whom were 44 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, 208 cur&eacute;s, 50 canons and commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> advocated almost as forcibly as did the Third Estate the establishment of a constitutional government based on the separation of the powers, the periodical convocation of the States General, their supremacy in financial matters, the responsibility of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and the regular guarantee of individual liberty. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and great reforms tending to the establishment of liberty were advocated by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on the eve of the Revolution. When the Estates assembled 5 May, 1789, the Third Estate demanded that the verification of powers should be made in common by the three orders, the object being that the Estates should form but one assembly in which the distinction between the "orders" should disappear and where every member was to have a vote. Scarcely a fourth of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> advocated this reform, but from the opening of the Estates it was evident that the desired individual voting which would give the members of the Third Estate, the advocates of reform, an effectual preponderance.

<p>As early as 23 May, 1789, the cur&eacute;s at the house of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> were of the opinion that the power of the deputies should be verified in the general assembly of the Estates, and when on 17 June the members of the Third Estate proclaimed themselves the "National Assembly", the majority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> decided (19 June) to join them. As the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the nobility still held out, the king caused the hall where the meetings of the Third Estate were held to be closed (20 June), whereupon the deputies, with their president, Bailly, repaired to the Jeu de Paume and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was taken not to disband till they had provided <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with a constitution. After Mirabeau's thundering speech (23 June) addressed to the Marquis de Dreux-Br&eacute;z&eacute;, master-of-ceremonies to Louis XVI, the king himself (27 June) invited the nobility to join the Third Estate. Louis XVI's dismissal of the reforming minister, Necker, and the concentration of the royal army about <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, brought about the insurrection of 14 July, and the capture of the Bastille. M. Funck-Brentano has destroyed the legends which rapidly arose in connection with the celebrated fortress. There was no rising <em>en masse</em> of the people of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the number of the besiegers was but a thousand at most; only seven <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were found at the Bastille, four of whom were forgers, one a young man guilty of monstrous crimes and who for the sake of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was kept at the Bastille that he might escape the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a>, and two insane <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. But in the public opinion the Bastille symbolized royal absolutism and the capture of this fortress was regarded as the overthrow of the whole regime, and foreign nations attached great importance to the event. Louis XVI yielded before this agitation; Necker was recalled; Bailly became Mayor of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Lafayette, commander of the national militia; the tri-colour was adopted, and Louis XVI consented to recognize the title of "National Constituent Assembly". Te Deums and processions celebrated the taking of the Bastille; in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> the Abb&eacute; Fauchet preached the harmony of religion and liberty. As a result of the establishment of the "vote by order" the political privileges of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> may be considered to have ceased to exist.



<p>During the night of 4 August, 1789, at the instance of the Vicomte de Noailles, the Assembly voted with extraordinary enthusiasm the abolition of all privileges and <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the equality of all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>. A blow was thereby struck at the wealth of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> were the first to give an example of sacrifice. Plurality of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and annates was abolished and the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was agreed upon, but two days later, the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> becoming uneasy, demanded another discussion of the vote which had carried the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. The result was the abolition, pure and simple, of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> without <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. In the course of the discussion Buzot declared that the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> belonged to the nation. Louis XVI's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> began to be alarmed. He temporized for five weeks, then merely published the decrees as general principles, reserving the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to approve or reject the measures which the Assembly would take to enforce them.
<h2>Declaration of the rights of man. Catholicism ceases to be the religion of the state</h2>

<p>Before giving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a constitution the Assembly judged it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to draw up a "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen", which should form a preamble to the Constitution. Camus's suggestion that to the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of man should be added a declaration of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, was rejected. The Declaration of Rights mentions in its preamble that it is made in the presence and under the auspices of the Supreme Being, but out of three of the articles proposed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, guaranteeing the respect due to religion and public worship, two were rejected after speeches by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, Rabaut Saint-Etienne, and Mirabeau, and the only article relating to religion was worded as follows: "No one shall be disturbed for his opinions, even religious, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." In fact it was the wish of the Assembly that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> should cease to be the religion of the State and that liberty of worship should be established. It subsequently declared <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> eligible to all offices (24 Dec., 1789), restored to their possessions and status as <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> the heirs of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> refugees (10 July and 9 Dec., 1790), and took measures in favour of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (28 January, 26 July, 16 Aug., 1790). But it soon became evident in the discussions relating to the Civil Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that the Assembly desired that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which the majority of the French people belonged, should be subject to the State and really organized by the State.

<p>The rumours that Louis XVI sought to fly to Metz and place himself under the protection of the army of Bouill&eacute; in order to organize a counter-revolutionary movement and his refusal to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> the Declaration of the Rights of Man, brought about an uprising in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The mob set out to <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, and amid insults brought back the king and queen to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (6 Oct., 1789). Thenceforth the Assembly sat at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, first at the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence, then at the Tuileries. At this moment the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of taking possession of the goods of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in order to meet financial exigencies began to appear in a number of journals and pamphlets. The plan of confiscating this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, which had been suggested as early as 8 August by the Marquis de Lacoste, was resumed (24 Sept.) by the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economist</a>, Dupont de Nemours, and on 10 October was supported in the name of the Committee of Finances in a report which caused <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> by Talleyrand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, who under the old regime had been one of the two "general agents" charged with defending the financial interests of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On 12 October Mirabeau requested the Assembly to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (1) that the ownership of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> belonged to the nation that it might provide for the support of the priests; (2) that the salary of each cur&eacute; should not be less than 1200 livres. The plan was discussed from 13 October to 2 November. It was opposed the Abb&eacute; de Montesquieu, and the Abb&eacute; Maury, who contended that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> being a moral <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> could be an owner, disputed the estimates placed upon the wealth of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and suggested that their possessions should simply serve as a guarantee for a loan of 400,000,000 livres to the nation. The advocates of confiscation maintained that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> no longer existed as an order, that the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was like an escheated succession, and that the State had a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to claim it, that moreover the Royal Government had never expressly recognized the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as a proprietor, that in 1749 Louis XV had forbidden the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to receive anything without the authority of the State, and that he had confiscated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Malouet took an intermediate stand and demanded that the State should confiscate only superfluous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions, but that the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should be endowed with land. Finally, on 2 November, 1789, the Assembly decided that the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> be "placed at the disposal" of the nation. The results of this vote were not long in following. The first was Treilhard's motion (17 December), demanding in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> committee of the Assembly, the closing of useless <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and decreeing that the State should permit the religious to release themselves from their <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p>The discussion of this project began in February, 1790, after the Assembly by the creation of assemblies of departments, districts, and commons, had proceeded to the administrative reorganization of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The discussion was again very violent. On 13 February, 1790, the Assembly, swayed by the more radical suggestions of Barnave and Thouret, decreed as a "constitutional article" that not only should the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> no longer recognize <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations were and should remain suppressed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and that no others should be established in the future. After having planned a partial suppression of monastic orders the Assembly voted for their total suppression. The proposal of Cazal&egrave;s (17 February) calling for the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, and the rightful efforts, made by the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to prevent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from purchasing the confiscated goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> provoked reprisals. On 17 March, 1790, the Assembly decided that the 400,000,000 livres worth of alienated <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical properties</a> should be sold to municipalities which in turn should sell them to private buyers. On 14 April it decided that the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship should be provided for without recourse to the revenues of former <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and that a sufficient sum, fixed at more than 133,000,000 livres for the first year, should be entered in the budget for the allowances to be made to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; on 17 April the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was passed dealing with the <em>assignats</em>, the papers issued by the Government paying interest at 5 per cent, and which were to be accepted as money in payment for the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesial property</a>, thenceforth called national <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; finally, on 9 July, it was decreed that all this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> should be put up for sale.
<h2>Civil constitution of the clergy</h2>

<p>On 6 February, 1790, the Assembly charged its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> committee, appointed 20 Aug., 1789, and composed of fifteen members to prepare the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Fifteen new members were added to the committee on 7 February. The "constituents" were disciples of the eighteenth century <em>philosophes </em>who subordinated religion to the State; moreover, to understand their standpoint it is well to bear in mind that many of them were jurists imbued with Gallican and Josephist <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Finally Taine has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that in many respects their religious policy merely followed in the footsteps of the old regime, but while the old regime protected the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and made it the church exclusive, recognized, the constituents planned to enslave it after having stripped it of its privileges. Furthermore they did not take into account that there are mixed matters that can only be regulated after an agreement with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. They were especially incensed against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> after the consistorial address in which <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (22 March, 1790) reproved some of the measures already taken by the Constituent Assembly, and by the news received from the West and South where the just dissatisfaction of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consciences had provoked disturbances; in particular the election of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Rabaut Saint-Etienne to the presidency of the National Assembly brought about commotions at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>. Under the influence of these disturbances the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was developed. On 29 May, 1790, it was laid before the Assembly. <a href="../cathen/02646b.htm">Bonal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and some members of the Right requested that the project should be submitted to a national council or to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But the Assembly proceeded; it discussed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy from 1 June to 12 July, 1790, on which date it was passed.

<p>This Constitution comprised four titles.

<p>Title I, Ecclesiastical Offices: Diocesan boundaries were to agree with those of departments, 57 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> being thus suppressed. The title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was abolished; out of 83 remaining <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> 10 were called <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and given <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. No section of French territory should recognize the authority of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> living abroad, or of his delegates, and this, adds the Constitution, "without prejudice to the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the communion which shall be maintained with the head of the Universal Church". <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">Canonries</a>, <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> were abolished. There should no longer be any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> posts especially devoted to fulfilling the conditions of Mass foundations. All appeals to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were forbidden.

<p>Title II, Appointment to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">Benefice</a>: Bishops should be appointed by the Electoral Assembly of the department; they should be invested and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity to the nation, the King, the Law, and the Constitution; they should not seek any confirmation from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be elected by the electoral assemblies of the districts. Thus all citizens, even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and nominal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, might name titulars to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, and the first <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity to the Constitution which denied to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> any effective power over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Title III, Salary of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of Religion: The Constitution fixed the salary of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> at 51,000 livres (about $10,200), that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of towns whose population exceeded 50,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> at 20,000 livres (about $4000), that of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at 12,000 livres (about $2400), that of cur&eacute;s at a sum ranging from 6000 (about $1200) to 1200 livres (about $240). For the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> this was a betterment of their material condition, especially as the real value of these sums was two and one-half times the present amount.

<p>Title IV, dealing with residence, made very severe conditions regarding the absences of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>At the festival of the Federation (14 July, 1790) Talleyrand and three hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> officiating at the altar of the nation erected on the Champs-de-Mars wore the tri-colored girdle above their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestments and besought the blessing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the Revolution. Deputations were present from the towns of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and there was inaugurated a sort of cult, of the Fatherland, the remote origin of all the "Revolutionary cults". On 10 July, 1790, in a confidential <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> to Louis XVI, <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> expressed the alarm with which the project under discussion filled him. He commissioned two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who were <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of Louis XVI, Champion de Cic&eacute; and Lefranc de Pompignan, to urge the king not to sign the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. On 28 July, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Louis XVI replied that he would be compelled, "with death in his soul", to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> the Constitution, that he would reserve the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to broach as soon as possible the matter of some concession, but that if he refused, his life and the lives of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> would be endangered.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> replied (17 August) that he still held the same opinion of the Constitution, but that he would make no public declaration on the subject until he consulted with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. On 24 August the king <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the Constitution, for which he was blamed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a confidential <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> on 22 September. M. Mathiez claims to have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the hesitancy of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> was due to temporal rather than to spiritual considerations, to his serious fears about the affairs of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and the Comtat Venaissin, where certain popular parties were clamoring for French troops, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, who had made known his opinion of the Constitution to two <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, was awaiting some manifestation on the part of the French episcopate. Indeed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> spoke before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had spoken publicly. At the end of October, 1790, they published an "Exposition des principes sur la constitution civile du clerg&eacute;", compiled by Boisgelin, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> in which they rejected the Constitution and called upon the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to do the same. This publication marks the beginning of a violent conflict between the episcopate and the Constitution. On 27 November, 1790, after a speech by Mirabeau, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> stipulated that all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should within a week, under penalty of losing their offices, take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to the Constitution, that all who refused and who nevertheless continued to discharge their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions should be prosecuted as disturbers of the public peace. The king, who was much disturbed by this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, eventually sanctioned it (26 December, 1790) in order to avoid a rising.

<p>Hitherto a large section of the lesser <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had shown a certain amount of sympathy for the Revolution, but when it was seen that the episcopal members of the Assembly refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, thus sacrificing their sees, a number of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> followed this disinterested example. It may be said that from the end of 1790 the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the truly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> elements of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were united against the revolutionary measures. Thenceforth there were two classes, the non-juring or refractory <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who were faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and refused the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and the jurors, sworn, or Constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who had consented to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. M. de la Gorce has recently sought to estimate the exact proportion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Out of 125 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there were only four, Talleyrand of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, Brienne of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, Jarente of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and Lafond de Savine, of <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Viviers</a>; three coadjutors or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>, Gobel, Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of B&acirc;le; Martial de Brienne, Coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>; and Dubourg-Miraudet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Babylon. In the important towns most of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Statistics for the small boroughs and the country are more difficult to obtain. The national archives preserve the complete dockets of 42 departments which were sent to the Constituent Assembly by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. This shows that in these 42 departments, of 23,093 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> called upon to swear, 13,118 took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. There would be therefore out of 100 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 56 to 57 jurors against 43 to 44 non-jurors. M. de la Gorce gives serious reasons for contesting these statistics, which were compiled by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> bureaucrats anxious to please the central administrators. He asserts on the other hand that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had little hold in fifteen departments and concludes that in 1791 the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was 52 to 55 out of 100; this is a small enough majority, but one which M. de la Gorce considers authentic.

<p>On 5 February, 1791, the Constituent Assembly forbade every non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to preach in public. In March the elections to provide for the vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> took place. Disorder grew in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; young and ambitious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, better known for their political than for their religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, were candidates, and in many places owing to the opposition of good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> those elected had much difficulty in taking possession of their churches. At this juncture, seeing the Constitutional Church thus setup in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against the legitimate Church, <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> wrote two letters, one to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and one to Louis XVI, to inquire if there remained any means to prevent <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and finally, on 13 April, 1791, he issued a solemn condemnation of the Civil Constitution in a solemn <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people. On 2 May, 1791, the annexation of the Comtat Venaissin and the city of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> by the French troops marked the rupture of diplomatic relations between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. From May, 1791, there was no longer an ambassador from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or a <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> encouraged the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The Masses celebrated by non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attracted crowds of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Then mobs gathered and beat and outraged <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. On 7 May, 1791, the Assembly decided that the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as <em>pr&ecirc;tres habitu&eacute;s </em>might continue to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches or conduct their services in other churches on condition that they would respect the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and not stir up revolt against the Civil Constitution. The Constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> became more and more unpopular with good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; Sciout's works go to show that the "departmental directories" had to spend their time in organizing regular police expeditions to protect the Constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> against the opposition of good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, or to prosecute the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who heroically persisted in remaining at their posts. Finally on 9 June, 1791, the Assembly forbade the publication of all <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> or Decrees of the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at least until they had been submitted to the legislative body and their publication authorized. Thus Revolutionary <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> not only broke with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but wished to place a barrier between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>

<p>The king's tormenting <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was the chief reason for his attempted flight (20-21 June, 1791). Before fleeing he had addressed to the Assembly a declaration of his dissatisfaction with the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and once more protested against the moral <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which had compelled him to accept such a document. Halted at Varennes, Louis XVI was brought back on 25 June, and was suspended from his functions till the completion of the Constitution, to which he took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> 13 Sept., 1791. On 30 Sept., 1791, the Constituent Assembly dissolved, to make way for the Legislative Assembly, in which none of the members of the Constituent Assembly could sit. The Constituent Assembly had passed 2500 <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and reorganized the whole French administration. Its chief <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from a social standpoint, which <a href="../cathen/16052b.htm">Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu</a> calls a capital one, was to pass the Chapelier <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> (15 June, 1791), which forbade working people to band together and form associations "for their so-called common interest". Led astray by their spirit of <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a> and their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for certain abuses of the old corporations, the Constituents did not understand that the world of labour should be organized. They were responsible for the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> which reigned during the nineteenth century, and the present syndicate movement as well as the efforts of the social <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">"Rerum novarum"</a> marks a deep and decisive reaction against the work of the Constituent Assembly.
<h2>The legislative assembly</h2>

<p>When the Constituent Assembly disbanded (30 Sept., 1791), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> all was aflame concerning the religious question. More than half the French people did not want the new Church, the factitious creation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; the old <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was ruined, demolished, hunted down, and the general amnesty decreed by the Constituent Assembly before disbanding could do nothing towards restoring peace in the country where that Assembly's bungling work had unsettled the consciences of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The parties in the Legislative Assembly were soon irreconcilable. The <a href="../cathen/06064a.htm">Feuillants</a>, on the Right, saw no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> save in the Constitution; the Girondins on the Left, and the Montagnards on the Extreme Left, made ready for the Republic. There were men who, like the poet Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier, dreamed of a complete Separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. "The priests", he wrote in a letter to the "Moniteur" (22 October, 1791), "will not trouble the Estates when no one is concerned about them, and they will always trouble them while anyone is concerned about them as at present." But the majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly had sat in the departmental or district assemblies; they had fought against the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and brought violent passions and a hostile spirit to the Legislative Assembly. A report from Gensonn&eacute; and Gallois to the Legislative Assembly (9 October, 1791) on the condition of the provinces of the West denounced the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as exciting the populace to rebellion and called for measures against them. It accused them of complicity with the &eacute;migr&eacute;s <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> the Revolutionary L&eacute;cuyer, having been slain in a church, some citizens reputed to be partisans of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were thrown into the ancient <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> castle and strangled (16-17 Oct., 1791). Calvados was also the scene of serious disturbances.

<p>The Legislative Assembly, instead of repairing the tremendous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Constituent Assembly, took up the question of the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. On 29 November, on the proposal of Fran&ccedil;ois de Neufch&acirc;teau, it decided that if within eight days they did not take the civil <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> they should be deprived of all salary, that they should be place under the surveillance of the authorities, that if troubles arose where they resided they should be sent away, that they should be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for a year if they persisted in remaining and for two years if they were convicted of having provoked disobedience to the king. Finally it forbade non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the legal exercise of worship. It also requested from the departmental directories lists of the jurors and non-jurors, that it might, as it said, "stamp out the rebellion which disguises itself under the pretended dissidence in the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion". Thus its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> ended in a threat. But this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was the object of a sharp conflict between Louis XVI and the Assembly. On 9 Dec., 1791, the king made his veto known officially. Parties began to form. On one side were the king and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the other the Assembly and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The legislative power was on one side, the executive on the other. In March, 1792, the Assembly accused the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of Louis XVI; the king replaced them by a Girondin ministry headed by Dumouriez, with Roland, Servan, and Clavi&egrave;re among its members. They had a double policy: abroad, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and at home, measures against the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Louis XVI, surrounded by dangers, was also accused of duplicity; his secret negotiations with foreign courts made it possible for his enemies to say that he had already conspired against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> of 19 March, 1792, renewed the condemnation of the Civil Constitution and visited with major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> all juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who after sixty days should not have retracted, and all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who remained faithful to these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The Assembly replied by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 27 May, 1792, declaring that all non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> might be deported by the directory of their department at the request of twenty citizens, and if they should return after expulsion they would be liable to ten years of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Louis vetoed this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. Thus arose a struggle not only between Louis XVI and the Assembly, but between the king and his ministry. On 3 June 1792, the Assembly decreed the formation of a camp near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of 20,600 volunteers to guard the king. At the ministerial council Roland read an insulting letter to Louis, in which he called upon him to sanction the decrees of November and May against the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He was dismissed, whereupon the populace of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> arose and invaded the Tuileries (20 June, 1792), and for several hours the king and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were the objects of all manner of outrages. After the public manifesto of the Duke of Brunswick in the name of the powers in coalition against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (25 July, 1792) and the Assembly's declaration of "Fatherland in danger" there came petitions for the deposition of the king, who was accused of being in communication with foreign rulers. On 10 August, Santerre, Westermann, and Fournier l'Am&eacute;ricain at the head of the national guard attacked the Tuileries defended by 800 <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>. Louis refused to defend himself, and with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> sought refuge in the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly passed a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which suspended the king's powers, drew up a plan of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for the dauphin, and convoked a national convention. Louis XVI was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Temple by order of the insurrectionary Commune of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>Madness spread through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> caused by the threatened danger from without; arrests of non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> multiplied. In an effort to make them give way. The Assembly decided (15 August) that the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> should consist only of the promise to uphold with all one's might liberty, equality, and the execution of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or to die at one's post". But the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> remained firm and refused even this second <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. On 26 August the Assembly decreed that within fifteen days they should be expelled from the kingdom, that those who remained or returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should be deported to <a href="../cathen/07062a.htm">Guiana</a>, or should be liable to ten years <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. It then extended this threat to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who, having no publicly recognized <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, had hitherto been dispensed from the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, declaring that they also might be expelled if they were convicted of having provoked disturbances. This was the signal for a real civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The peasants armed in La Vend&eacute;e, Deux S&egrave;vres, Loire Inf&eacute;rieure, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a> and Loire, Ile and Vilaine. This news and that of the invasion of Champagne by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army caused hidden influences to arouse the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> populaces hence the September massacres. In the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> of La Force, the Conciergerie, and the Abbaye Saint Germain, at least 1500 Women, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and soldiers fell under the axe or the club. The celebrated tribune, Danton, cannot be entirely acquitted of complicity in these massacres. The Legislative Assembly terminated its career by two measures against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: it deprived <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to register births etc., and authorize <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. Laicizing the civil state was not in the minds of the Constituents, but was the result of the blocking of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. The Legislative Assembly was induced to enact it because the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> would not have recourse to Constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for registering of births, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, and deaths.
<h2>The convention; the Republic; the Reign of Terror</h2>

<p>The opening of the National Convention (21 Sept., 1792) took place the day following Dumouriez's victory at Valmy over the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops. The constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Gr&eacute;goire, proclaimed the republic at the first session; he was surrounded in the assembly by fifteen constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and twenty-eight constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But the time was at hand when the constitutional <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in turn was to be under suspicion, the majority of the Convention being hostile to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself. As early as 16 November, 1792, Cambon demanded that the salaries of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> be suppressed and that thenceforth no religion be subsidized by the State, but the motion was rejected for the time being. Henceforth the Convention enacted all manner of arbitrary political measures: it undertook the trial of Louis XVI, and on 2 January, 1799, "hurled a kings head at <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>". But from a religious standpoint it was more timid; it feared to disturb the people of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, which its armies were annexing to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. From 10 to 15 March, 1793, formidable insurrections broke out in La Vend&eacute;e, Anjou, and a part of Brittany. At the same time Dumouriez, having been defeated at Neerwinden, sought to turn his army against the Convention, and he himself went over to the Austrians. The Convention took fright; it instituted a Revolutionary Tribunal on 9 March and on 6 April the Committee of Public Safety, formidable powers, was established.

<p>Increasingly severe measures were taken chiefly against the non-juring <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On 18 Feb., 1793, the Convention voted a prize one hundred livres to whomsoever should denounce a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> liable to deportation and who remained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> despite the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. On 1 March the <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s </em>were sentenced to perpetual banishment and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated. On 18 March it was decreed that any <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> or deported <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> arrested on French soil should be executed within twenty-four hours. On 23 April it was enacted that all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who had not taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 15 August, 1792, should be transported to Guiana; even the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> should be treated likewise if six citizens should denounce them for lack of citizenship. But despite all these measures the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had maintained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> an official internuncio, the Abb&eacute; de Salamon, who kept himself in hiding and performed his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> at the risk of his life, gave information concerning current events, and transmitted orders. The proconsuls of the Convention, Fr&eacute;ron and Barras at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> and Toulon, Tallien at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Carrier at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, perpetuated abominable massacres. In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the Revolutionary Tribunal, carrying out the proposals of the public accuser, Foquier-Tinville, inaugurated the Reign of Terror. The proscription of the Girondins by the Montagnards (2 June, 1793), marked a progress in demagogy. The assassination of the bloodthirsty in demagogue Marat, by Charlotte Corday 913 July 1793) gave rise to extravagant manifestations in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Marat. But the provinces did not follow this policy. News came of insurrections in Caen, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and Toulon; and at the same time the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were in Roussillon, the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, the Austrians in Valenciennes, and the Vendeans defeated Kleber at Torfou (Sept., 1793). The crazed Convention decreed a rising en masse; the heroic resistance of Valenciennes and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> gave Carnot time to organize new armies. At the same time the Convention passed the Law of Suspects. (17 Sept., 1793), which authorized the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of almost anyone and as a consequence of which 30,000 were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. Informing became a trade in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/09665a.htm">Queen Marie Antoinette</a> was beheaded 16 October, 1793. Fourteen <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> who were executed 17 July, 1794, were declared Venerable by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1902.

<p>From a religious point of view a new feature arose at this period &mdash; the constitutional <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, accused of sympathy with the Girondins, came to be suspected almost as much as the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Numerous conflicts arose between the constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Convention which did not permit the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to ask those intending to marry if they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, had been to confession, or were <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>. The constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would not submit to the Convention when it required them to give <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the nuptial blessing. Despite the example of the constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Thomas Lindet, a member of the Convention, who won the applause of the Assembly by ann his marriage, despite the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> given by Gobel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in appointing a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to a post in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the majority of constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remained hostile to the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The conflict between them and the Convention became <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> when, on 19 July, 1793, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Convention decided that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who directly or indirectly offered any obstacle to the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be deported and replaced. In October the Convention declared that the constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> themselves should be deported if they were found wanting in citizenship. The measures taken by the Convention to substitute the Revolutionary calendar for the old <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Christian calendar</a>, and the decrees ordering the municipalities to seize and melt down the bells and treasures of the churches, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that certain currents prevailed tending to the dechristianization of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On the one hand the rest of <em>d&eacute;cadi</em>, every tenth day, replaced the Sunday rest; on the other the Convention commissioned Leonard Bourdon (19 Sept., 1793) to compile a collection of the heroic actions of Republicans to replace the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The "missionary representatives", sent to the provinces, closed churches, hunted down citizens suspected of religious practices, endeavoured to constrain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, and threatened with deportation for lack of citizenship <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who refused to abandon their posts. Persecution of all religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> began. At the request of the Paris Commune, Gobel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and thirteen of his vicars resigned at the bar of the Convention (7 November) and their example was followed by several constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>The Montagnards who considered worship <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> replaced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Sunday Mass by the civil mass of <em>d&eacute;cadi</em>. Having failed to reform and nationalize <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> they endeavoured to form a sort of civil cult, a development of the worship of the fatherland which had been inaugurated at the feast of the Federation. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Notre-Dame-de-Paris became a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Reason, and the feast of Reason was celebrated on 10 November. The Goddesses of Reason and Liberty were not always the daughters of low people; they frequently came of the middle classes. Recent research has thrown new light on the history of these cults. M. Aulard was the first to recognize that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of honouring the fatherland, which had its origin in the festival of the Federation in 1790 gave rise to successive cults. Going deeper M. Mathiez developed the theory that confronted by the blocking of the Civil Constitution, the Conventionals, who had witnessed in the successive feasts of the Federation the power of formulas on the minds of the masses, wanted to create a real <em>culte de la patrie</em>, a sanction of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the fatherland. On 23 November, 1793, Chaumette passed a law alienating all churches in the capital. This example was followed in the provinces, where all city churches and a number of those in the country were closed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. The Convention offered a prize for the <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by passing a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which assured a pension to Priests who <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a>, and the most painful day of that sad period was 20 November, 1793, when men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children dressed in Priestly garments taken from the Church of St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s marched through the hall of the Convention. Laloi, who presided, congratulated them, saying they had "wiped out eighteen centuries of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>". Despite the part played by Chaumette and the Commune of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the work of violent dechristianization, M. Mathiez has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it is not correct to lay on the Commune and the <em>Exag&eacute;r&eacute;s, </em>they were called, the entire responsibility, and that a Moderate, an Indulgent, namely Thuriot, the friend of Danton, was one of the most violent instigators. It is thus clear why Robespierre who desired a reaction against these excesses, should attack both <em>Exag&eacute;r&eacute;s</em> and Indulgents.

<p>Indeed a reactionary movement was soon evident. As early as 21 November, 1793, Robespierre complained of the "madmen who could only revive fanaticism". On 5 December he caused the Convention to adopt the text of a manifesto to the nations of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in which the members declared that they sought to protect the liberty of all creeds; on 7 December, he supported the motion of the committee of public safety which reported the bad effect in the provinces of the intolerant <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the missionary representatives, and which forbade in the future all threats or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> contrary to liberty of worship. These decrees were the cause of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> between Robespierre an enthusiasts such as H&eacute;bert and Clootz. At first Robespierre sent his enemies to the scaffold; H&eacute;bert and Clootz were beheaded in March, 1704, Chaumette and Bishop Gobel in April. But in this same month of April Robespierre sent to the scaffold the Moderates, Desmoulins and Danton, who wanted to stop the Terror, and became the master of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with his lieutenants Couthon and Saint-Just. M. Aulard regards Robespierre as having been hostile to the dechristianization for religious and political motives; he explains that Robespierre shared the admiration for Christ felt by Rousseau's Vicar <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a> and that he feared the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effect on the powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> of the Convention's anti-religious policy. M. Mathiez on the other hand considers that Robespierre did not condemn the dechristianization in principle; that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the common hostility to the Committee of Public Safety of Moderates such as Thuriot and enthusiasts like H&eacute;bert; and that on the information of Basire and Chabot he suspected both parties of having furthered the fanatical measures of dechristianization only to discredit the Convention abroad and thus more easily to plot with the powers hostile to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Robespierre's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> intentions are still an historical problem. On 6 April, 1794, he commissioned Couthon to propose in the name of the Committee of Public Safety that a feast be instituted in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Supreme Being, and on 7 May Robespierre himself outlined in a long speech the plan of the new religion. He explained that from the religious and Republican standpoint the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a Supreme Being was advantageous to the State, that religion should dispense with a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were to religion what charlatans were to medicine, and that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Supreme Being was Nature. The Convention desired to have this speech translated into all languages and adopted a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of which the first article was: "The French people recognize the existence of a Supreme Being and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". The same <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> states that freedom of worship is maintained but adds that in the case of disturbances caused by the exercise of a religion those who "excite them by fanatical preaching or by counter Revolutionary innovations", shall be punished according to the rigour of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Thus the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> remained equally precarious and the first festival of the Supreme Being was celebrated throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on 8 June, 1794, with aggressive splendour. Whereas the <em>Exag&eacute;r&eacute;s </em>wished simply to destroy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Reason political rather than moral doctrines were taught. Robespierre desired that the civic religion should have a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code which he based on the two <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He was of the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had a social value, that public morality depended on it and that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> would more readily support the republic under the auspices of a Supreme Being.

<p>The victories of the Republican armies, especially that of Fleurus (July, 1794), reassured the patriots of the Convention; those of Cholet, <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Mans</a>, and Savenay, marked the checking of the Vendean insurrection. Lyons and Toulon were recaptured, Alsace was delivered, and the victory of Fleurus (26 June, 1794) gave <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. While danger from abroad was decreasing, Robespierre made the mistake of putting to vote in June the terrible law of <em>22 Prairial</em>, which still further shortened the summary procedure of the Revolutionary tribunal and allowed sentence to be passed almost without trial even on the members of the Convention. The Convention took fright and the next day struck out this last clause. Montagnards like Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, and Collot d'Herbois, threatened by Robespierre, joined with such Moderates as Boissy d'Anglas and Durand Maillane to bring about the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat of 9 Thermidor</em> (27 July, 1794). Robespierre and his partisans were executed, and the Thermidorian reaction began. The Commune of Paris was suppressed, the Jacobin Club closed, the Revolutionary tribunal disappeared after having sent to the scaffold the public accuser Fouquier-tinville and the Terrorist, Carrier, the author of the <em>noyades</em> (drownings) of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. The death of Robespierre was the signal for a change of policy which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of advantage to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; many <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were released and many <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> returned. Not a single law hostile to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was repealed, but the application of them was greatly relaxed. The religious policy of the Convention became indecisive and changeable. On 21 December 1794, a speech of the constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Gr&eacute;goire, claiming effective liberty of worship, aroused violent murmurings in the Convention, but was applauded by the people; and when in Feb., 1795, the generals and commissaries of the Convention in their negotiations with the Vendeans promised them the restoration of their religious liberties, the Convention returned to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> supported by Gr&eacute;goire, and at the suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, Boissy d'Anglas, it passed the Law of 3 <em>Vent&ocirc;se </em>(21 Feb., 1795), which marked the enfranchisement of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This law enacted that the republic should pay salaries to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of no religion, and that no churches should be reopened, but it declared that the exercise of religion should not be disturbed, and prescribed penalties for disturbers. Immediately the constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> issued an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> for the Establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, but their credit was shaken. The confidence of the faithful was given instead to the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were returning by degrees. These <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were soon so numerous that in April, 1795, the Convention ordered them to depart within the month under pain of death. This was a fresh outbreak of anti-Catholicism. With the fluctuation which thenceforth characterized it the Convention soon made a counter-movement. On 20 May, 1795, the assembly hall was invaded by the mob and the deputy F&eacute;raud assassinated. These violences of the Extremists gave some influence to the Moderates, and 30 May, at the suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Lanjuinais, the Convention decreed that (Law of 11 <em>Prairial</em>) the churches not confiscated should be place at the disposal of citizens for the exercise of their religion, but that every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who wished to officiate in these churches should previously take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of submission to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; those who refused might legally hold services in private houses. This <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of submission to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> was much less serious than the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> formerly prescribed by the Revolutionary authorities, and the Abb&eacute; Sicard has shown how Emery, Superior General of St. Sulpice, Bausset, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alais and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were inclined to a policy of pacification and to think that such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> might be taken.

<p>While it seemed to be favouring a more tolerant policy the Convention met with diplomatic successes, the reward of the military victories: the treaties of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, of the Hague with the <a href="../cathen/02346b.htm">Batavian</a> Republic, of Basle with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, gave to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as boundaries the Alps, the Rhine, and the Meuse. But the policy of religious pacification was not lasting. Certain periods of the history of the Convention justify M. Champion's theory that certain religious measures taken by the Revolutionists were forced upon them by circumstances. The descent of the <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em> on the Breton coasts, to be checked by Hoche at Quiberon, aroused fresh attacks on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. On 6 Sept., 1795 (Law of 20 <em>Fructidor</em>), the Convention exacted the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of submission to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> even of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who officiated in private houses. The Royalist insurrection of 13 <em>Vend&eacute;miaire</em>, put down by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, provoked a very severe <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against deported <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who should be found on French territory; they were to be sentenced to perpetual banishment. Thus at the time when the Convention was disbanding, churches were separated from the State. In theory worship was free; the Law of 29 Sept., 1795 (7 <em>Vend&eacute;miaire</em>), on the religious policy, though still far from satisfactory to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, was nevertheless an improvement on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Terror, but <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> and the spirit of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> still disturbed the whole country. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> owes to the Convention a number of lasting creations: the Ledger of the Public Debt, the Ecole Polytechnique, the Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, the Bureau of Longitudes, the Institute of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the adoption of the decimal system of weights and measures. The vast projects drawn up with regard to primary, secondary and higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> had almost no results.

<p>In virtue of the so-called "Constitution of the year III", <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the Convention 23 Sept., 1795, a Directory of five members (27 Oct., 1795) became the executive, and the Councils of Five Hundred and of the Ancients, the legislative power. At this time the public treasuries were empty, which was one reason why the people came by degrees to feel the necessity of a strong restorative power. The Directors Carnot, Barras, Letourneur, Rewbell, La Reveilli&egrave;re-L&eacute;peaux were averse to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and in the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> saw only a means of annihilating the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They wished that even the Constitutional episcopate, though they could not deny its attachment to the new regime, should become extinct by degrees, and when the constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> died they sought to prevent the election of successors, and multiplied measures against the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 16 April, 1796, which made death the penalty for, provoking any attempt to overthrow the Republican government was a threat held perpetually over the heads of the non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. That the Directors really wished to throw difficulties in the way of all kinds of religion, despite theoretical declarations affirming liberty of worship is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the Law of 11 April, 1796, which forbade the use of bells and all sorts of public convocation for the exercise of religion, under penalty of a year in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and, in case of a second offense of deportation. The Directory having ascertained that despite police interference some non-juring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were officiating publicly in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and that before the end of 1796 more than thirty churches or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> had been opened to non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, laid before the Five Hundred a plan which, after twenty days, allowed the expulsion from French soil, without admission to the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> prescribed by the Law of Vend&eacute;miaire, all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had not taken the Constitutional Oath prescribed in 1790, or the Oath of Liberty and Equality prescribed in 1792; those who after such time should be found in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> would be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. But amid the discussions to which this project gave rise, the revolutionary Socialist conspiracy of Babeuf was discovered, which showed that danger lay on the Left; and on 5 Aug., 1796, the dreadful project which had only been passed with much difficulty by the Five Hundred was rejected by the Ancients.

<p>The Directory began to feel that its policy of religious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was no longer followed by the Councils. It learned also that <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, who in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> led the armies of the Directory from victory to victory, displayed consideration for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Furthermore, the electors themselves showed that they desired a change of policy. The elections of 20 may, 1797, caused the majority of Councils to pass from the Left to the Right. Pichegru became president of the Five Hundred, a Royalist, Barth&eacute;lemy, became one of the Five Directors. Violent discussions which took place from 26 June to 18 July, in which <a href="../cathen/13213b.htm">Royer-Collard</a> distinguished himself, brought to the vote the proposal of the deputy Dubruel for the abolition of all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> passed since 1791. The Directors, alarmed by what they considered a reactionary movement, commissioned General Augereau to effect the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat of 18 Fructidor</em> (4 Sept., 1797); the elections of 49 departments were quashed, two Directors, Carnot and Barth&eacute;lemy, proscribed, 53 deputies deported, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the &eacute;migr&eacute; and non-juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> restored to their vigour. Organized hunting for these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took place throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; the Directory cast hundreds of them on the unhealthy shore of Sinnamary, <a href="../cathen/07062a.htm">Guiana</a>, where they died. At the same time the Directory commissioned Berthier to make the attack on the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> had refrained. The Roman Republic was proclaimed in 1798 and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>. An especially odious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was renewed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> customs; it was known as the <em>d&eacute;cadaire</em> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Officials and municipalities were called upon to overwhelm with vexations the partisans of Sunday and to restore the observance of <em>d&eacute;cadi</em>. The rest of that day became compulsory not only for administrations and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but also for business and industry. Marriages could only be celebrated on <em>d&eacute;cadi</em> at the chief town of each canton.

<p>Another religious venture of this period was that of <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">Theophilanthropists</a>, who wished to create a spiritualist church without <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> or <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, a sort of vague religiosity, similar to the "ethical <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>." Contrary to what has been asserted for one hundred years, M. Mathiez has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">Theophilanthropism</a> was not founded by the director La R&eacute;veilli&egrave;re-L&eacute;peaux. It was the private initiative of a former Girondin, the librarian Chemin Dupont&eacute;s, which gave rise to this cult; Valentine Hauy, instructor of the blind and former Terrorist, and the <a href="../cathen/12067a.htm">physiocrat</a>, Dupont de Nemours, collaborated with him. During its early existence, the new Church was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by agents of Cochon, Minister of Police, who was the tool of Camot, and it was only for a short time, after the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat of 18 Fructidor</em>, that the Theophanthropists benefited by the protection of La R&eacute;veilli&egrave;re. In proportion to the efforts of the Directory for the <em>culte d&eacute;cadaire</em>, the <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">Theophilanthropists</a> suffered and were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, they were sometimes treated even worse than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> being at times permitted to occupy the buildings connected with certain churches while the <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">Theophilanthropists</a> were driven out. On a curious memoir written after <em>18 Fructidor</em> entitled "Des circonstances actuelles qui peuvent terminer la Revolution et des principes qui doivent fonder la R&eacute;public en France", the famous Madame de Stael, who was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, declared herself against <a href="../cathen/14624a.htm">Theophilanthropy</a>; like many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, she hoped that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> would become the State religion of the Republic. Through its clumsy and odious religious policy the Directory exposed itself to serious difficulties. Disturbed by the anti-religious innovations, the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> provinces revolted; 6000 <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were proscribed. Brittany, Anjou. and Maine again revolted, winning over Normandy. Abroad the prestige of the French armies was upheld by were upheld by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but they were <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> on the Continent, and in 1799 were compelled to evacuate most of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte's</a> return and the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat of 18 Brumaire</em> (10 November 1799) were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to strengthen the glory of the French armies and to restore peace to the country and to consciences.
