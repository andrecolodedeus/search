<h1>Friedrich Karl Joseph, Freiherr von Erthal</h1>  

<p>Last Elector and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, b. 3 Jan., 1719, at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; d. 25 July, 1802, at Aschaffenburg. He was an unworthy brother of Franz Ludwig, the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, held <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> in <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> at an early age, became canon at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1753, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1754, president of the Aulic Council in 1758, and <a href="../cathen/04577a.htm">custos</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1768. From 1769-1774 he was plenipotentiary of the Electorate of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> at the imperial court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. On 18 July, 1774, he succeeded the deceased von Breidbach-Burresheim as Elector and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and eight days later as Prince-Bishop of Worms. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 11 Sept., 1774, and received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the following year on 14 May. At the beginning of his reign it appeared as if he would try to stem the tide of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> which had swept over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> during the weak rule of von Breidbach-Burresheim. One of his first acts as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the dismissal of the <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinking</a> councillors of his predecessor. Soon, however, he became one of the most notable supporters of <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thought</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> in the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. George Forster, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, became his librarian and William Heinse, another <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and author of the lascivious romance "Ardinghello", was his official reader. Erthal suppressed the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and used their revenues to meet the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, in which he appointed numerous <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a> as professors. <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">Notorious</a> unbelievers such as Anthony Blau and others were invited to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1784 to supplant the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.

<p>As a spiritual ruler, Erthal was guided by the principles of <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a>. In union with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Max Franz of Cologne, Clemens Wenzeslaus of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Hieronymus Joseph of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> he convoked the Congress of Ems at which twenty-three antipapal articles, known as the "Punctuation of Ems", were drawn up and signed by the plenipotentiaries of the four <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> on 25 August, 1786. The purpose of the Punctuation was to lower the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity to a merely honorary primacy and to make the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a <em>primus inter pares</em>, with practically no authority over the territories of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. In order to increase his political influence he joined (25 October, 1785) the Confederation of Princes which was established by King Frederick the Great. In 1787 he apparently receded from the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> position of the Punctuation of Ems and applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a renewal of his quinquennial faculties and for the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of his new coadjutor, Karl Theodor von Dalberg. Somewhat later, however, he resumed his opposition to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority and continued to adhere to the Punctuation even after the other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> had rejected it. His opposition was made futile by the revolutionary <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which raged in his electorate from 1792-1801. By the treaty of Campo-Formio in 1797 Erthal was deprived of his possessions west of the Rhine and by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> he lost also <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over that part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The negotiations concerning the reimbursement of Erthal for the loss of his territory west of the Rhine were not yet completed when he died.
