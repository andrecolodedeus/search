<h1>Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner</h1>  

<p>Convert, poet, and <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, born at Konigsberg, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, 18 November, 1768; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 17 February, 1823. When sixteen years old he attended lectures on law and political economy at the University of Konigsberg, and at the same time was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> disciple of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>. He received an appointment as clerk in the War Office, which post he retained for twelve years, residing at Konigsberg and other cities, lastly at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. During this era the poet, who from his youth had led a dissipated life, was married and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> three times. During the years 1801-04 he lived at Konigsberg in order to take care of his mother, who had lost her mind; she died on 24 February, 1804, and on the same day his friend Mnioch also died at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. This day of double sorrow provided him with the title of his best known tragedy, "Der 243 Februar". The next year Werner was transferred to Berlin as a confidential clerk. While there he devoted himself entirely to poetry. In 1907 he began a period of wandering, finally going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he "renounced his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>" and was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (19 April, 1810). After this event his life flowed somewhat more smoothly. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Aschaffenburgh on 14 June, 1814. In August of the same year he went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where the historic congress was then assembled. The peculiarities both of his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> attracted great attention. From 1816 to 1817 he lived with a Polish count in Podolia, then returned to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and lived in the house of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Count von Hohenwarth. In 1821 he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, but soon left it, owing to failing health. He was able to preach, however, a fortnight before his death.

<p>Werner undoubtedly possessed great dramatic talent, but he lacked self-control, and produced no work of lasting merit. The most important, besides the tragedy already mentioned, are: "Vermischte Gedichte" (1789), "Die S&ouml;hne des Tales" (1803), "Das Kreuz an der Ostsee" (1806). To counterbalance the effect of his "Martin Luther" (1807), he wrote, after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, "Die Weihe der Unkraft (1814). During this latter period of his life, also, he wrote "Die Mutter der Maddab&auml;er", a tragedy in which a beautiful tribute is paid to his mother in the principal character. His sermons were not published until 1840.
