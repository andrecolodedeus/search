<h1>Friedrich, Prince of Schwarzenberg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and Prince-Archbishop of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 6 April, 1809; d. there, 27 March, 1885. Son of Prince Joseph John Schwarzenberg and his spouse Pauline (<em>n&eacute;e</em> Princess Arenberg), he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> palace in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. When <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> advanced upon <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, the mother fled with her one-month-old child to Krummau in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. In the summer of the following year she accompanied her husband and eldest daughter to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to be present at the marriage festivities of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and Archduchess Marie-Louise. During the celebration she and her daughter were burned to death; a golden necklace, on which were engraved the names of her ten children (including that of Friedrich), alone made it possible to identify the charred mass as her remains. Her sister-in-law Eleanora henceforth acted as mother to the children and was always called by Fritz his "Engelstante". When he was five years old, Fritz was placed under the care of the learned and able Father Lorenz Greif. Having completed the secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> course in the Schotten gymnasium, he applied himself to juridical studies with great success. Reluctantly he now revealed to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> his desire to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his life to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, as this was for him the surest way to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The father gave his consent with some hesitation.

<p>Fritz began his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, as his numerous relatives in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> would prove too great a distraction. Archbishop Gruber was his spiritual father, and one cannot peruse their correspondence without emotion. Able professors, among whom <a href="../cathen/12660b.htm">Joseph Othmar von Rauscher</a> was conspicuous, fanned the enthusiasm of the young student. Fritz was to make his last year's <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he was to reside in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, Franz Zenner, a strict disciplinarian, acted almost harshly towards Schwarzenberg. Besides the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> lectures he received private instruction in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> from G&uuml;nther, who later exercised a constant guiding influence over his pupil. On entering the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, Friedrich had promised his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to accept none of the higher orders before his twenty-fourth year. On the completion of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, the question arose of how the remaining two years were to be passed. Friedrich was seized with a desire to travel, which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was anxious to gratify. However, Bishop Gruber insisted that he must study for the doctorate, while Zenner demanded that the candidate for the doctorship must continue to reside in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Schwarzenberg's refusal to comply was followed by a breach which the young man, however, endeavoured to remedy. He successfully passed the examinations for the doctorate. Finally, in 1833, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Gruber. The young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; he derived great satisfaction from the performance of his pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. But clouds now threatened him; he had to hurry to his dying father, to whom he administered the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In June, 1835, the fatherly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> died in Friedrich's arms, after receiving extreme unction from him.

<p>On 23 September, 1835, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter requested that Schwarzenberg be made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, though he was not yet thirty years old, and thus needed a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. Anxious and sad of heart, he accepted the staff of <a href="../cathen/13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a> with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and determination. In the archdiocese the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> people of the Zillertal were the chief cause of trouble; they remained there, notwithstanding every effort to induce them to withdraw and in spite of the patent of emigration of Archbishop Firmian (1731). An imperial resolution of 1837 ordered their return to the national Church or their emigration. Archbishop Schwarzenberg was greatly pained to see hundreds of those Zillertaler leave their native land, and left nothing untried to induce them by affectionate persuasion at least to leave their children behind, promising to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> and support them; but in vain. Among the institutions founded or favoured by Schwarzenberg may be mentioned: the Mozarteum, the Cathedral Musical Society, the Art Society, the boys' <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (Borrom&auml;um), the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Vincent de Paul</a> at Schwarzach for the nursing of the sick and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young. The foundation at Schwarzach bore magnificent fruit, but impoverished him. It was only fitting that a marble monument of him was erected there in 1910.

<p>On 29 March, 1848, he issued an exhortation to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, urging them to correct the mistaken views and unfounded anxieties of their flock, to keep the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> free from political declamations and allusions, and to cultivate good feelings with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a>. Schwarzenberg was no friend of politics, even church politics. However, for more than forty years he was the leading churchman in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and during those years arose a host of new institutions, tendencies, and conditions, profoundly affecting <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in the Hapsburg empire. These conditions entailed a huge amount of work for him. Although the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had commanded provincial councils to be held every three years, the custom had fallen into disuse. In Salzburg the last provincial synod had been held in 1573. Schwarzenberg, after so long an intermission, convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> which sat from 31 August to 12 September, 1848. In the address to the imperial parliament, the synod laid down what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must needs demand from the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> in order to secure the liberty and independence which rightfully belonged to her, and which could not be denied her without inconsistency and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in view of the free development of civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at this synod also issued a pastoral, subjecting Sommaruga's fundamental principles of state <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to severe criticism.

<p>Of fundamental importance for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was the meeting of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1849. The Reichstag which sat at Kremsier in February debated the relations of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in a very unfriendly spirit. However, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> brother, Felix, was already prime minister, and by the appointment of Rauscher, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> teacher, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sekkau, Schwarzenberg greatly strengthened the influence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> succeeded without much difficulty in convening the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and the Lombardo-Venetian territory, in which peace had not yet been restored, were not invited. On 29 April twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and four episcopal proxies met in the palace of the prince-archbishop, and between this date and 20 June held sixty sessions. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> conducted the sessions with the greatest tact. Among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were Kutschker and <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler</a>. The assembly laid the results of their deliberations before the Government in seven memorials: on marriage; on the religious, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> funds; on <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>; on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and offices and religious services; on monasticism; on <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. In the decrees, which include 207 paragraphs, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> lay down "a common line of action for their future aims and action". This first assembly of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> lay the foundation for the revival of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; it marks the beginning of an Austrian episcopate, whereas before there had been only individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. To urge the carrying out of the memorials, and to represent the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> permanently, a standing committee of five was appointed under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. It existed until the sixties.



<p>About this time also the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. In spite of his earnest protests both at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, the appointment was confirmed, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> made his solemn entry into Prague on 15 August, 1850. He had not yet familiarized himself with his new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> when <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> ordered him and the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> to undertake the visitation of all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> which were not subject to the superior-general of an order; these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were 380 in number. He had no share in the settling of the concordat, but did his utmost to carry it out. For this object a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was held at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> under his presidency from 6 April to 17 June, 1856. Sixty-six <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> &mdash; German, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a>, Italian, and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> &mdash; were present, representing the Latin, Greek, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rites. Memorials were again addressed to the Government concerning the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, marriage, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, the filling of vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the right of patronage. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Prague thereupon organized an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matrimonial court, held a provincial and two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> councils, and promoted the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, the growth of the orders, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and the arts. That the concordat was carelessly executed is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. As his adviser in questions of canon law the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> chose Professor Friedrich von Schulte, likewise appointing him, although he was a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, counsel of the spiritual matrimonial court in all three instances and titular consistorial counsel. Schwarzenberg showed himself a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> friend of his teacher, G&uuml;nther, and sought by repeated intercession at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to prevent the condemnation of his writings. The first serious delay in the execution of the provisions of the concordat occurred when the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and foundations were to be turned over to church officials. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> thought that the questions of the manner of transfer had been agreed upon, and furnished printed instructions on the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the church officials and to the patrons. The minister of state, Schmerling, stopped the transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> in <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. In union with his three suffragans, Schwarzenberg protested to the emperor, the minister of state, and the governor (19 March, 1862). However, the only effect of this protest was the assertion of principle.

<p>The year 1866, so unfortunate in the history of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, was especially unfortunate for Schwarzenberg. On 25 May, while on his tour of visitation, he fell ill of smallpox. The German <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> seemed already unavoidable, and, when the manifesto of 15 June announced its outbreak, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who regarded it as his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to remain at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, ordered public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and intercessory processions. One of the consequences of the misfortune of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> fields of battle was the change in the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. On 25 May, 1858, the decrees of the Reichstag concerning marriage, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and interconfessional relations were confirmed by the emperor. On 22 June <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> condemned the decrees; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had on 3 June issued a common instruction to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and on 24 June issued a collective pastoral. Both these last-mentioned decrees were condemned by the imperial courts as breaches of the public peace and confiscated. It was to be expected that the legal proceedings pending against Bishop Rudiger of <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a> would be extended to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. In February, 1869, Schwarzenberg received the following instruction from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>: "If the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> are summoned before lay judges, let them in every possible case plead their causes through an attorney, and never appear personally and of their own accord before such judges". The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> regretted this, since he had hoped that his ill-treatment might awaken many slumbering <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The conflict about the concordat was not yet over, and a new conflict was threatening which in the name of freedom endangered the liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> convened the Council of the Vatican (8 December, 1869-18 July, 1870). On the question of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>, Schwarzenberg supported the minority.

<p>The void left by the annulment of the concordat, Stremayr in 1874 sought to fill up by four new inter-confessional <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> dealing with the regulation of the external legal relations of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the taxes providing for the so-called <em>Religionsfond</em>, the legal relations of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the recognition of new religious corporations. During the deliberations of the House of Peers Schwarzenberg vigourously opposed the proposed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and condemned them in a carefully prepared speech. However, it was impossible to defeat them entirely. Of Stremayr's four new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that on the legal status of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, authorizing the minister of public worship to suppress any <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and to confiscate its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, had not yet passed. As soon as Schwarzenberg heard that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> law was to be discussed in the House of Peers in the middle of January, 1876, he convened a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the House of Peers; the eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in the Schwarzenberg palace. To the deliberations were also admitted Abbot Helferstorfer, Leo Thun, and His Excellency Falkenhayn. The result of the meeting was the "Declaration" signed by all the Austrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that entertain the certain hope that a law of such content and so harmful in its effects shall never be enacted. Should, however, they find themselves disappointed in this confident expectation, they must declare that so harmful a law should not be enacted and protest against the imputation that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could ever tolerate and ratify a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order whose vocation and activity would merit the mistrustful and suspicious regulations expressed in the draft of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The bill was passed, but did not receive the sanction of the emperor.

<p>In 1882 the division of the University of Karl Ferdinand into a German and a Czechish was effected, but Cardinal Schwarzenberg would not agree to the division of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, holding that it was the vocation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to work for the reconciliation and union of the various races in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. After his death this separation could not be prevented.

<p>Among the many institutions, etc., introduced by Schwarzenberg we may mention: the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> exercises, pastoral conferences, <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> (two), <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, the heritage of <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> for the support of poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> relief funds; establishments of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, Notre-Dame, Grey Sisters, <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Borrom&auml;us</a>, and Sisters of St. Vincent; popular missions; the Forty Hours' Adoration; the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/01213b.htm">St. Agnes of Bohemia</a>; the jubilee of Methodius; the jubilee of the Diocese of Prague; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> jubilees; the Katholikenverein; the Bonifaciusverein; the Confraternity of St. Michael; the Prokopius fund for the publication of good books; perpetual adoration; vestment <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> building <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. At the first episcopal meeting in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and at all the succeeding conferences, Schwarzenberg had always presided. At the meeting of 1885 he accepted his election as president, but reserved the right of joining in the debate. At the eighth session the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was unable to appear on account of ill-health; on the next day Schwarzenberg again presided, although very feverish, but hurried from this session to what was destined to be his death-bed. His remains lie in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Prague.
