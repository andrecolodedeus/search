<h1>Friedrich Staphylus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, 27 Aug., 1512; died at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, 5 March, 1564. His father, Ludeke Stapellage, was an official of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>. Left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at an early age he came under the care of an uncle at Danzig, then went to Lithuania and studied at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, after which he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and philosophy at Padua. About 1536 he went to <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, obtained the Degree of <em>magister artium</em> in 1541 and at <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon's</a> recommendation became a tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Count of Eberstein. In 1546 Duke Albert of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> appointed Staphylus professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the new University of K&ouml;nigsberg, which the duke had founded in 1544. At this time Staphylus was still under the influence of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> opinions, as is shown by his academic disputation upon the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification, "De justificationis articulo". However, at his installation as professor he obtained the assurance that he need not remain if the duke tolerated <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which "might be contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the <em>primitiv&oelig; apostolic&oelig; et catholic&oelig; ecclesi&oelig; consensum</em>". This shows that even then he regarded with suspicion the development of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He had at K&ouml;nigsberg a violent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> dispute with William Gnapheus. In 1547-48 he was the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> elected by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but in 1548 he resigned his professorship, because he met with enmity, and was dissatisfied with religious conditions in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Still he continued to be one of the councillors of the duke. In 1549 he married at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> the daughter of John Hess, a reformer of that place.

<p>Returning to K&ouml;nigsberg, a new dispute broke out between him and Osiander. The dogmatic dissension, which seemed to him to make everything uncertain, drove him continually more and more to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Tradition and to the demand for the authoritative exposition of the Scriptures by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He expressed these views in the treatise "Synodus sanctorum patrum antiquorum contra nova dogmata Andre&aelig; Osiandri", which he wrote at Danzig in 1552. A severe illness hastened his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, which took place at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> at the end of 1552. After this he first entered the service of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, for whom he established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Neisse. In 1555 the Emperor Ferdinand I appointed him a member of the imperial council. At the Disputation of Worms in 1557 he opposed, as one of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> collocutors, the once <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>. In his "Theologi&aelig; Martini Lutheri trimembris epitome" (1558) he severely attacked the lack of union in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, the worship of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and religious subjectivism. The treatise called forth a number of answers. In 1560 Duke Albert of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, at the request of Canisius, appointed Staphylus professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> after Staphylus had received the Degree of Doctor of Theology and Canon Law in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, as he was married. As superintendent (curator) he reformed the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. After this he took an active part in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> restoration in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. He drew up several opinions on reform for the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, as the "Counsel to Pius IV", while he declined to go to the council personally. In 1562 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent him a gift of one hundred gulden, and the emperor raised him to the nobility. His learning and eloquence are frankly acknowledged by his <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> fellow-countryman Hermann Hamelmann. The attempt is now no longer made to trace his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to mercenary motives.
