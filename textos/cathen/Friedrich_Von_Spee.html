<h1>Friedrich Von Spee</h1>  

<p>A poet, opponent of trials for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, born at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, 25 February, 1591; died at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> 7 August, 1635. On finishing his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1610, and, after prolonged studies and activity as a teacher at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, Worms, and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1622. He became professor at the University of Paderborn in 1624; from 1626 he taught at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, Wesel, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Cologne, and was preacher at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. An attempt to assassinate him was made at Peine in 1629. He resumed his activity as professor and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> and later at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and in 1633 removed to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. During the storming of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> by the imperial forces in March, 1635, he distinguished himself in the care of the suffering, and died soon afterwards from the results of an infection contracted in a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. He was one of the noblest and most attractive figures of the awful era of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>. His literary activity belongs to the last years of his life, the details of which are little known, Two of his works were not published until after his death: "Goldenes Tugendbuch" (Golden Book of Virtues), a book of devotion highly prized by Leibniz, and the "Trutznachtigall", a collection of fifty to sixty sacred songs, which, though not free from the weaknesses of the day, take a prominent place among religious lyrics of the seventeenth century, and have been in recent times repeatedly printed and revised. But the assumption that the author in this work applied the metrical principle independent of Opitz, is at least <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. His principal work, through which he obtained a well-deserved and world-wide reputation, is the "Cautio Criminalis", written in admirable Latin. It is an arraignment of trial for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, based upon his own awful experiences probably principally in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, for the traditional assumption that he acted for a long time as "witch confessor" in <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> has no documentary authority. This work was printed in 1631 at Rinteln without Spee's name or permission, although he was doubtlessly widely known as its author. He does not advocate the immediate abolition of trials for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, but describes in thrilling language and with cutting sarcasm the horrible abuses in the prevailing legal proceedings, particularly the inhuman use of the rack. He demands measures of reform, such as a new German imperial law on the subject, liability to damages on the part of the judges, etc., which, if they had been conscientiously carried out, would have quickly put an end to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a>. Many a generation passed before <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witch</a> burning ceased in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the classic land of these outrages; but at all events the "Cautio Criminals" brought about its abolition in a number of places, especially at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and led the way to its gradual suppression. The moral impression created by its publication was very great. Even in the seventeenth century a number of new editions and German translations appeared, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also eagerly assisting in promoting its circulation. Among the members of Spee's order his treatise seems to have usually found a favourable reception, although it was published without official sanction, and its publication led to a correspondence between the general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the order on the Lower Rhine, and Spee himself. The general wished more exact information as to how the printing took place and expressed the suspicion that Spee, even if he, perhaps, did not directly cause it, at least allowed it, and wrote him a mild rebuke.

Since then much new material has appeared in the publications of DUHR, <em>Die Stellung der Jesuiten in den deutschen Hexenprocessen,</em> published by the G&ouml;rresgesellschaft (1900); DIEL, <em>Friedrich Spee</em> in <em>Sammlung historischer Bildnisse,</em> second edition revised by DUHR (1901).
