<h1>Friedrich von Schmidt</h1>  

<p>Born at Frickenhofen, 1825; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1891, After studying at the technical high school at Stuttgart, he became, in 1845, one of the guild workers employed in building the Cologne <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, on which he worked for fifteen years. Most of the working drawings for the towers were made by Schmidt and Statz. In 1848 he attained to the rank of master-workman and in 1856 passed the state examination as architect. After becoming a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1858, he went to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> as professor of architecture and began the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of San Ambrogio. On account of the confusion caused by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1859 he went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he was a professor at the academy and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> architect from 1862; in 1865 he received the title of chief architect, and in 1888 was ennobled by the emperor. Next to <a href="../cathen/06050a.htm">Ferstel</a> he is the most important modern <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architect</a>. In this style he built at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> the Church of St. Lazarus, the church of the White Tanners, that of the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a>. He also built the Classical <em>gymnasium</em> with a Gothic <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> and the memorial building erected on the site of the amphitheatre that had been destroyed by fire. The last mentioned building was in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Gothic. A large number of small <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular buildings in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were designed by him. His last work was the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Funfkirchen in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. His chief fame however he gained by his restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Stephen at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He took down the spire and worked on its rebuilding up to 1872. His design for the town-hall of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> was also a very successful one. The projecting middle section has a fine central tower that rises free to a height of 328 ft. and is flanked by four smaller towers. This section harmoniously combines height with broad horizontal members. A large court and six smaller ones are enclosed by the extensive building, the wings of which end in pavilions. Nothing in the building shows the regularity of a set pattern; the architect, rather, made skilful use of individual <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <em>motifs</em>. When he began in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> his manner was rather stiff, but he worked his way up to artistic freedom. In building the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church at Funfhaus he even ventured to set a <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> with two towers in front of an octagonal central structure with a high <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> and a corona of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. His motto was to unite German force with Italian freedom. He modified the tendency to height in the German Gothic by horizontal members and introduced many modifications into the old standard of the style in order to attain a more agreeable general effect. In this way he always remained unfettered and original in his style and replaced in part what was lacking in decorative details or in the means of producing the same. He was teacher and model to many younger architects. A bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of him has been placed before the town-hall of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. His son Heinrich was overseer at the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> and afterwards professor of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> architecture at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>.
