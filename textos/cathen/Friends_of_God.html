<h1>Friends of God</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> G<font size=-2>OTTESFREUNDE</font>).

<p>An association of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and lay, having for its object the cultivation of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; its name alludes no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to <a href="../bible/joh015.htm">John 15:14-15</a>. The circles of the "Friends of God" appears to have had its origin in Basle between the years 1339 and 1343, and to have thence extended down the Rhine even as far as the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, the cities most prominent in its history being Basle, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and Cologne. Seeing the disturbed state of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in the large territory, the holy associates united in their efforts to counteract the many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influences of the time, by applying themselves <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to the practices of the interior life, and working diligently for the conversion of sinners. From this group of ascetics, whose sole bond of union was their common desire for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of German mystics took its rise. They aimed at becoming <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and at giving edification at <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> devotion, not heterodox enthusiasm; at affective contemplation, not arid speculation. Their great leaders were two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the eloquent preacher <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">John Tauler</a> (c. 1300-1361) and the contemplative writer <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Blessed Henry Suso</a> (c. 1300-1365); to these must be added <a href="../cathen/07237a.htm">Henry of N&ouml;rdlingen</a>, Conrad of Kaiserheim, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> John of Tambach (a celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>), John of Sternengassen, Dietrich of Colmar, and <a href="../cathen/11064b.htm">Nicholas of Strasburg</a>. Among those whom they directed in the path of perfection were several communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, chiefly <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> (e.g. in Unterlinden, Engelthal). Of these Dominicanesses, the most renowned for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical</a> writers Christina and Margaretha Ebner. Among their disciples living in the world, the following may be mentioned: Rulman Merswin, a wealthy merchant of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (1382), Henry of Rheinfefden, and the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of Landsberg. The sermons, treatises, and letters of the "Friends of God" are remarkable for beauty of style, those of <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a> constituting the best prose of the fourteenth century, the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/07237a.htm">Henry of N&ouml;rdlingen</a> and Margaretha Ebner being the earliest examples of epistolary literature in the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>, and the sermons of <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a> being masterpieces of eloquence.

<p>As long as the association remained under the guidance of men like <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a> and <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, masters in the spiritual life, it was preserved from blemish. <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a> was the founder of the Children of Mary, and, in an age that witnessed the decadence of scholasticism or scientific <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, both friends based all their <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, particularly on the solid system of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. As <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso's</a> "Book of the Eternal Wisdom" was composed for spiritual reading, so was his "Book of Truth" written to refute the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and fanatic excesses of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards</a> and the Brethren of the Free Spirit. On his part, <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a> opposed the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> of the Fraticelli and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> tendencies of Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. But the glory of the "Gottesfreunde" soon came to an end. A lay member of the association, Rulman Merswin, through either <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, brought the whole group of German mystics into disrepute. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of his alleged guide and master in the spiritual life &mdash; the mysterious <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> of the Oberland (Der Gottesfreund vom Oberland), the "Friend of God" <em>par excellence</em>, to whom Merswin, in his posthumous work "Das Buch von den neun Felsen", ascribes revelations, prophecies of impending chastisements, and a divine mission to purify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &mdash; was diametrically opposed to that of <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a>, <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, and the others. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> conclusively that Merswin's great unknown is a myth, but, as the "Great Friend of God" had previously been regarded as the reformer of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and a precursor of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> of the Oberland (Alsace) was much lauded and often quoted by those <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers who asserted that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> German <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> was incompatible with Roman supremacy, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, etc. After Rulman Merswin's death, Nicholas of Basle became the leader of the pseudo-Friends of God, but was eventually condemned as a <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghard</a> and burned at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1409. Another prominent member of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, his disciple Martin of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, had suffered a like punishment sixteen years before in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, for submitting unreservedly to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and maintaining several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> propositions. From the beginning of the fifteenth century, the "Friends of God", whether <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> or heterodox, disappear from the pages of history.
