<h1>Frobenius Forster</h1>  

<p>Prince-Abbot of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, b. 30 Aug., 1709, at K&ouml;nigsfeld in Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; d. 11 Oct., 1791, at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. After studying the humanities and philosophy at Freising and Ingolstadt, he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> where he took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 8 Dec., 1728. He made his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies partly at his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and partly at Rott, where the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had their common study house. Shortly after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in 1733, he became professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> and for some time held the office of master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. In 1745 he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and physics. Two years later he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> where he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> until he became librarian and prior in 1750. He had gained an enviable reputation as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and scientist, and was one of the first religious who endeavoured to reconcile <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> and the Leibniz-Wolffian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Though leaning towards the Leibniz-Wolffian philosophy, he rejected many of its teachings, such as the <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a> optimism of Leibniz and the mechanism of Wolff, and was rather an eclectic than a slavish follower of any one system. In 1759 Forster was chosen one of the first members of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> academy of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. A year later he laid down the office of prior and was appointed <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> at Hohengebraching, a dependency of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, situated about five miles south of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. On 24 July, 1762, he was elected as successor to the deceased Prince-Abbott Johann Baptist Kraus of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>.

<p>Forster's election was the inauguration of the golden era of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>. The learned new prince-abbott endeavoured to impart his own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for learning to each of his subjects and offered them every facility to advance in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. During his reign the course given in the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> at <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> became famous throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and drew scholars not only from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, but also from the houses of other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. In order to promote the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, Forster called the learned <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurist</a> philologist, Charles Lancelot of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, who instructed the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> in Oriental languages from 1 Oct., 1771, to 27 May, 1775. To encourage his young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> still more in their respective studies, he founded a physical, a mineralogical, and a numismatic cabinet and procured the best available literature in the various branches. Forster's chief literary production in his carefully prepared edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> which appeared in two folio volumes (4 parts) at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1777. It is reprinted in the Latin Patrology of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (vols. C and C1). He also wrote in Latin five short <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises and a dissertation on the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. From a codex preserved in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter at Freising he edited the decrees of the Synod of Aschheim and made a German translation of it for "Abhandlungen der Bayr. Akad. der Wissenschaften" (I,30-60); and from a codex in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> he published in Mansi's "Collectio Ampl. Conciliorum" (XIII, 1025-28), the decrees of a <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held during the times of the Agilolfings.
