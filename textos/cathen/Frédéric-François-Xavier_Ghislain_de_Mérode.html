<h1>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric-Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Ghislain de M&eacute;rode</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and statesman, born at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1820; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1874. The son of F&eacute;lix de M&eacute;rode-Westerloo who held successively the portfolios of foreign affairs, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and finances under King Leopold, and of Rosalie de Grammont, he was allied to the best names of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, &#151; Lafayette, Montmorency, Clemont-Tonnerre, etc.; the M&eacute;rode <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> claimed <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> like <a href="../cathen/05389a.htm">Elizabeth of Hungary</a>, founders like Werner who endowed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Schwartzenbroch, and a long line of captains from that Raymond-B&eacute;renger who took the cross at St. Bernard's call, to Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, Xavier's grandfather, who gave his life for the autonomy of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Bereft of his mother at the age of three, Xavier was brought up at Villersexel, in Franche-Comt&eacute;, by his aunt Philippine de Grammont, attended for a time the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, then entered the Coll&egrave;ge de Juilly presided over by de Salinis, whence he passed (1839) to the Military Academy of Brussels. Graduating with the rank of second lieutenant, after a short service at the armoury of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, he joined (1844) as foreign attach&eacute; the staff of Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal Bugeaud in Algeria, taking a brilliant part in the most daring engagements and winning the cross of the <em>L&eacute;gion d'honneur</em>. In 1847, he abruptly resigned the military career and went to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> (1849). Assigned, after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the French garrison of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, he was being pressed by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> when <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, with a view to attach him permanently to his court, made him <em>cameriere segreto</em> (1850), an office which entailed the direction of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>. The excellent work done by de m&eacute;rode for the material, moral, and religious betterment of the penitentiary system in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is described by Lefebvre (Des &eacute;tablissements charitables de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, p. 245.) and Maguire (Rome, Its Ruler and Institutions, p. 238); de Rayneval, the French envoy at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, praised it in an official report to his government (see "Daily News", 18 March, 1848); Joachim Pecci, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, wanted the young <em>cameriere</em> to inaugurate similar work in his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a>, despite their bias against everything <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>, found nothing to change in the regulations introduced by de M&eacute;rode. In 1860, when it became evident that the insincere policy of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> was a poor safeguard against the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, de M&eacute;rode, much against the views of the Roman Prelature, headed by <a href="../cathen/01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a>, persuaded <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to form a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> army and succeeded in enlisting the services of Lamorici&egrave;re (q.v.) as commander-in-chief and was himself appointed minister of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The task assumed by de M&eacute;rode and Lamorici&egrave;re was difficult and well-nigh impossible; yet the disasters of Castelfidardo and <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> were due, not to the incompetence of the chiefs, nor solely to the heterogeneous nature of the recruits and the lack of proper supplies, but to the treachery of the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> who, while feigning to curb the Garibaldian bands, led them to the assault of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>.

<p>The ensuing years of comparative quiet de M&eacute;rode spent in various public works; the building at his own expense of the <em>campo pretoriano</em> outside the Porta Pia, the clearing of the approaches of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> degli Angeli, the opening of streets in the new section of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the sanitation of the old quarters by the Tiber, etc. His impetuous temperament and progressive views made him enemies among the old traditional Roman element just as the vehemence with which he branded the French Emperor's duplicity turned against him the heads of the French army of occupation. Lamorici&egrave;re's death (19 Sept., 1865) became the signal of open hostility. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was forced to discharge his minister whose continuance in office, it was freely asserted, meant the withdrawal of the French troops. Reduced to a simple <em>cameriere</em>, de M&eacute;rode was not forgotten by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on Hohenlohe's promotion to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, he was given the vacant place of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> almoner and (22 June, 1866) <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Melitene</a>. His new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were to distribute the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and to confirm children in danger of death and he acquitted himself with a liberality and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that won him the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the poor and afflicted. At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, he showed the influence exercised over him by his brother-in-law, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">de Montalembert</a>, and sided with the minority that deemed the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> inopportune and even dangerous, but submitted the day the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> was defined. After the capture of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> (20 Sept., 1870) he followed his master into the retirement of the Vatican, leaving it only to fight the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> government's pretensions on the <em>campo pretoriano</em> or to share de Rossi's work in the excavations of Tor Marancino which resulted in the discovery of the Basilica of <a href="../cathen/11781b.htm">St. Petronilla</a>. It is there he welcomed (14 June, 1874) the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and his last public utterances were for them. Speaking of his kinsman Lafayette, he regretted his defection from the purity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but remarked that the country which the great general had so loyally served was yielding precious elements for the upbuilding of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; then, pointing to a Damasian inscription recently found, "Credite per Damasum possit quid gloria Christi", he added with pathos that the edifying spectacle of American loyalty to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> justified him in saying, "Credite per Pium possit quid gloria Christi". He died of acute pneumonia in the arms of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, only a few months before the <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a> in which he was to have been made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. His remains were laid to rest in the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> Cemetery near the Vatican, amid a vast concourse of people, the poor he had so generously assisted mingling with the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, ambassadors, and princes. De M&eacute;rode, in spite of his faults, will be remembered as a model of unswerving loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Such was his popularity that when <a href="../cathen/09657c.htm">Don Margotti</a>, in "l'Unit&agrave; Cattolica", suggested in his behalf a world-wide tribute of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the subscriber's names filled a large album published at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 1875.
