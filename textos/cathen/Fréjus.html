<h1>Fr&eacute;jus</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF FR&Eacute;JUS (FORUM JULII).

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>; comprises the whole department of Var (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). It was suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, re-established by that of 1817, and definitively established in 1823. The <em>arrondissement</em> of Grasse, which until 1860 belonged to the department of Var, when it was annexed to that of the Alpes-Maritimes, was, in 1886, separated from the Diocese of Fr&eacute;jus and attached to that of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 1852 authorized the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to assume the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fr&eacute;jus and Toulon. The present diocese comprises the territory of the ancient Diocese of Fr&eacute;jus as well as that of the ancient Diocese of Toulon.
<h2 id="section1">Fr&eacute;jus</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> would seem to have been introduced into Fr&eacute;jus in the time of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>. History relates that in 374 a certain Acceptus falsely declared himself guilty of some crimes in order to rid himself of the episcopal dignity, and that the Council of Valencia besought the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to name another in his stead. The following are named among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this see: <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">St. Leontius</a> (419-433), brother of St. Castor and friend of John Cassian, who dedicated to him his first ten "Collationes", and of <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a>; Theodore (433-455), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Iles d'Hy&egrave;res, to whom Cassian dedicated the last seven "Collationes"; St. Auxilius (c. 475), formerly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of L&eacute;rins, and later a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under Euric, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>; Riculfus (973-1000), who restored the ruins made by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the episcopal palace; Bertrand (1044-91), who founded the collegiate church of Barjols; Raymond <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> (1235-1248), who arranged the marriage of Beatrice, daughter of the Count of Provence, with Charles of Anjou; Jacques d'Euse (1300-1310), preceptor of <a href="../cathen/09385c.htm">St. Louis of Toulouse</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>; Cardinal Nicol&ograve; Fieschi (1495-1524), who at the time of his death was dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>; Andr&eacute;-Hercule de Fleury (1698-1715).
<h2 id="section2">Toulon</h2>

<p>The legend which states that a certain Cleon, who accompanied St. Lazarus to Gaul was the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Toulon, is based on an <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> document composed in the fourteenth century and ascribed to a sixth-century <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Didier. Honoratus and Gratianus, according to the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a> were the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Toulon whose names are known to history, but Duchesne gives Augustalis as the first historical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He assisted at councils in 441 and 442 and signed in 449 and 450 the letters addressed to <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> from the province of Arles. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, disciple and biographer of St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles, is also mentioned as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toulon. His episcopate, begun in 524, had not come to an end in 541; he converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoth</a> chiefs, Mandrier and Flavian, who became <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> on the peninsula of Mandrier.

<p>The Island of L&eacute;rins, well known as the site of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded there in 410 (see <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L<font size=-2>&Eacute;RINS</font></a>) was sold in 1859 by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fr&eacute;jus to an English purchaser. A number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of L&eacute;rins are especially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the diocese. Among them are Sts. Honoratus, C&aelig;sarius, Hilary, and Virgilius, all of whom became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Arles; Quinidius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a>; Valerius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>; Maximus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez; Veranus and Lambertus, Bishops of Vence; <a href="../cathen/15439b.htm">Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>, author of the "Commonitorium", and his brother Lupus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>; Agricola, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; Aigulphus and Porcarius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. St. Tropesius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>; St. Louis (1274-1297), a native of Brignoles, in the Diocese of Toulon, and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; and the virgin <a href="../cathen/13192a.htm">St. Roseline</a>, <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Celle-Roubaud, who died in 1329, and whose shrine, situated at Les Arcs near Draguignan, has been for six centuries a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, are likewise especially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the diocese. The sojourn in 1482 of <a href="../cathen/06231a.htm">St. Francis of Paula</a> at Bormes and at Fr&eacute;jus, where he caused the cessation of the plague, made a lasting impression. The chief places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the Diocese of Fr&eacute;jus and Toulon are those of Notre-Dame des Anges at Pignans, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which King Thierry established in 508, for the veneration of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> recovered by a shepherd and which, it was said, had been brought to Pignans by St. Nympha, niece of <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> and the companion of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a>; Notre-Dame de B&eacute;nat, a shrine <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the sixteenth century; Notre-Dame de Gr&acirc;ces at Cotignac, which dates from 1519, and later served by some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who formed themselves into a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community under the rule of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, and were the first <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1637, as the result of an apparition of the Blessed Virgin to Fr&egrave;re Fiacre, Louis XIII and Anne of Austria sent him to Cotignac to offer up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Anne of Austria became the mother of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and in 1660 he went in solemn state to Cotignac to return thanks to Notre-Dame de Gr&acirc;ces.

<p>The church of <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a>, begun towards the end of the thirteenth century by Charles II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and completed by the end of the fifteenth century, is the most beautiful example of pointed architecture in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The head of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> here, and the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> contains <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> which date from the first centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. (For an account of the traditions on this subject, see <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">LAZARUS</a> and <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">MARY MAGDALEN</a>.) The celebrated preacher <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a> (1663-1742) was born at Hy&egrave;res in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1905 (last year of the Concordat) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> numbered 326,384 inhabitants, 28 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 142 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 67 vicariates paid by the State. Before the enforcement of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> against the congregations in 1901 there were in the diocese communities of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. An important <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregation founded in 1838, for teaching and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work, was that of Notre-Dame de la Mis&eacute;ricorde, the mother-house of which was at Draguignan. Before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 the religious congregations possessed in the diocese 2 foundling asylums, 36 day nurseries, a seaside <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for sick children, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, situated in the country, 9 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 6 workhouses, 2 houses of rescue, 3 houses of charity for the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, 2 houses of retreat, 7 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for the care of the sick in their homes.
