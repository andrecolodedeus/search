<h1>Fulbert of Chartres</h1>  

<p>Bishop, b. between 952 and 962; d. 10 April, 1028 or 1029. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> and others think that he was born in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, probably at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but <a href="../cathen/11786b.htm">Pfister</a>, his latest biographer, designates as his birthplace the Diocese of Laudun in the present department of Gard in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> parentage and received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, where he had as teacher the famous Gerbert who in 999 ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as Sylvester II. In 990 Fulbert opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> which soon became the most famous seat of learning in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and drew scholars not only from the remotest parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but also from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Fulbert was also chancellor of the church of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> and treasurer of St. Hilary's at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. So highly was he esteemed as a teacher that his pupils were wont to style him "venerable <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>". He was a strong opponent of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendencies which had infected some dialecticians of his times, and often warned his pupils against such as extol their dialectics above the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Still it was one of Fulbert's pupils, <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a>, who went farthest in subjecting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to reason. In 1007 Fulbert succeeded the deceased Rudolph as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Archbishop Leutheric of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. He owed the episcopal dignity chiefly to the influence of King Robert of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who had been his fellow student at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he continued to teach in his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and also retained the treasurership of St. Hilary. When, about 1020, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> burned down, Fulbert at once began to rebuild it in greater splendour. In this undertaking he was financially assisted by King Canute of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Duke William of Aquitaine, and other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> sovereigns. Though Fulbert was neither <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> nor <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, as has been wrongly asserted by some historians, still he stood in friendly relation with Odilo of Cluny, Richard of St. Vannes, Abbo of Fleury, and other monastic celebrities of his times. He advocated a reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, severely rebuked those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who spent much of their time in warlike expeditions, and inveighed against the practice of granting <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>.

<p>Fulbert's literary productions include 140 epistles, 2 treatises, 27 <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Office. His epistles are of great historical value, especially on account of the light they throw on the liturgy and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> in the eleventh century. His two treatises are in the form of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>. The first has as its subject: Misit Herodes rex manus, ut affligeret quosdam de ecclesia, etc. (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs50">Acts 12:50</a>); the second is entitled "Tractatus contra Judaeos" and proves that the prophecy of Jacob, "Non auferetur sceptrumde Juda", etc. (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#vrs10">Genesis 49:10</a>), had been fulfilled in Christ. Five of his nine extant sermons are on the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">blessed Virgin Mary</a> towards whom he had a great devotion. The life of St. Aubert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (d. 667), which is sometimes ascribed to Fulbert, was probably not written by him. Fulbert's epistles were first edited by Papire le Masson (Paris, 1585). His complete works were edited by Charles de Villiers (Paris, 1608), then inserted in "Bibl. magna Patrum" (Cologne, 1618) XI, in "Bibl. maxima Patri." (Lyons, 1677), XVIII, and with additions, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXLI, 189-368.
