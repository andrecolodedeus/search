<p>DIOCESE OF FULDA (FULDENSIS).

<p>This diocese of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> takes its name from the ancient <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Fulda. To systematize the work of evangelizing <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> organized a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> on the usual <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> basis; in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Freising, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and Passau; in Franconia and Thuringia, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, Buraburg near Fritzlar, and Erfurt. To facilitate missionary work farther north, especially among the Saxons, he sought a suitable spot for the location of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He chose for this mission St. Sturmius, who, after journeying far and wide, found an appropriate place in the great forest of Buchonia, in the district of Grabfeld on the Fulda. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> sanctioned this choice of a location, and petitioned Carloman, to whom the country round about belonged, to grant him the site for a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Carloman yielded to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> request, and also induced the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobles who had estates in the vicinity to bestow a part of them on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On 12 March, 744, St. Sturmius took solemn possession of the land, and raised the cross. The wilderness was soon cleared, and the erection of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church, the latter dedicated to the Most Holy Redeemer, begun under the personnel direction of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. He appointed St. Sturmius first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the new foundation, which he intended to surpass in greatness all existing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and to be a nursery for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The rule was modelled on that of the <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Abbey of Monte Cassino</a>, as Sturmius himself had gone to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (748) for the express purpose of becoming familiar with it. To secure absolute autonomy for the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> obtained from Pope Zachary a privilege, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 4 November, 751, placing it immediately under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and removing it from all episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The authenticity of this document has frequently been called into question, but on the whole it is considered as well established. (For further details see Tangl in "Mitteilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichtsforschung", 1899; and B. Sepp, "Die Fuldaer Privilegien Frage", Ratisbon, 1908.) In 753 Pepin gave the royal sanction to this exemption from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> showed his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Fulda when he charged that his remains should be laid to rest there.

<p>Under the prudent administration of St. Sturmius (d. 779), the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> soon rose to greater splendour; from an early period the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> made it a national sanctuary for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Great success <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the agricultural work of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and small colonies which were established in different places gradually became the centres of villages and civil communities. Soon Fulda was the mother-house of a number of smaller <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which were later administered by provosts under the superiorship of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The gifts of German princes, nobles, and private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> increased the landed possessions of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> so rapidly that they soon extended over distant parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; there were estates in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Swabia: possessions along the Rhine, in East Frisia, and even at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (the church of Sant' Andrea). Even in artistic and literary lines Fulda rose to great importance. On the site of the first church, which had been artistically decorated by Sturmius, there rose under Abbots Baugulf (779-802), Ratgar (802-17), Eigil (818-22), and <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> (822-42) a magnificent edifice which roused the admiration of contemporaries, and even of posterity, and exerted a lasting influence on <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> and artistic activity in distant places. In addition to architecture, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> cultivated. The <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> established by Sturmius began to flourish during the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, and, under <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, particularly, was the chief nursery of civilization and learning in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and became celebrated throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It was open not only to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students, but also to young men desiring to embrace secular careers. The curriculum embraced the subjects usually taught during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>: the seven liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, physics, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>), the different branches of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>. Among the most renowned pupils of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were: <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, Walafried Strabo, <a href="../cathen/09436b.htm">Servatus Lupus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11350a.htm">Otfried of Weissenburg</a>, Rudolfus Fuldensis, Williram, Probus, and Meginhard; among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>: Einhard, Bernhard, King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Ulrich von Hutten. Rabanus also founded a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to familiarize the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> with religious and classical literature, and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> soon produced rich treasures of valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Unfortunately the greater part of this <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> disappeared during the looting of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hessians</a> in 1631, and has not since been discovered.

<p>Gradually the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> rose to a commanding position in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. From 968 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Gaul; from the time of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, arch-chancellor of the empress, whom he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> jointly with the Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; from the twelfth century he was a prince of the empire; from 1184 had the privilege of sitting at the left of the emperor; and from 1360 the imperial banner was borne before him by a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>. This glory, however, was not wholly without shadows. The monastic discipline was relaxed to such a degree that Abbot Marquard (1150-65) undertook to carry out a reform by introducing the regulations in force at Hirsau (Consuetudines Hirsaugienses). The importance of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as a centre of learning also declined. The great wealth of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in landed possessions, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, revenues, and regalia drew an increasing number of nobles to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. By the twelfth century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of noble birth had monopolized the seats of the chapter and, in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, practically all the important offices of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> itself, as well as the provostships of the dependent houses, were held by members of the German nobility. The difficulty of administering the vast landed possessions caused the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to grant certain sections in fief, which eventually resulted in great losses to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; for the feudatories frequently turned their positions to their own personal interests, and sought to convert the fiefs into private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. One of the most notable illustrations of the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of these monastic stewards is shown by the action of Count Johann von Ziegenhain in the fourteenth century, who, in an insurrection of the burgers of the city of Fulda against Abbot Heinrich VI von Hohenberg (1315-53), headed an attack on the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Not infrequently, too, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> as princes of the empire, and the demands made upon them by the state <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> most detrimental to the interests of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and its inmates. In 1294, on application of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> enjoined a separation of the abbatial and the conventual tables, which was put into effect in 1300 under Abbot Heinrich V von Weilnau (1288-1313) (cf. R&uuml;bsam, "Heinrich V. von Weilnau, F&uuml;rstabt von Fulda", Fulda, 1879). Imperial capitulations, of which there are records as early as the time of Heinrich VII von Kranlucken (1353-72), especially those of Johann I von Merlau (1395-1440), the "Old Statutes of 1395", restricted to a considerable degree the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and raised correspondingly the independent status of that institution. In the mother-house the dean eventually replaced the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for all practical purposes. For centuries the chapter preserved this independence, which involved the almost complete exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.



<p>At a comparatively early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> found access to the chapter of Fulda, with which, in 1513, the Abbey of Hersfeld had been united; and Abbot Johannes III von Henneberg (1521-41) was forced to consent to a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of reform favouring the spread of the new doctrines. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Abbot Balthasar von Dermbach (1570-1606) <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an earnest restorer of discipline in the chapter, vigorously inaugurating the work of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>. Banished by the members of the chapter and their colleagues in 1576, he was unable to return to his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> until 1602, great progress having been made meanwhile by the imperial administrators in restoring the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The foundation of a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in 1571 was the signal for the reflorescence of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which had sunk to comparative insignificance. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> gymnasium, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> founded (1584) a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which he placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Both of these institutions have contributed largely to the maintenance and spread of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. A similar <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for reform was displayed by Balthasar's second successor, Johann Bernhard Schenk von Schweinsberg (1623-32), whose exertions, together with the decrees of several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> visitors, particularly Pietro Luigi Caraffa (1627), restored to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> a certain measure of his proper authority, over against that of the chapter and the professors of noble birth. The decrees of reform issued by Caraffa, against which the provosts rebelled after the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio's</a> departure, were repeatedly confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The capitulars and provosts of noble birth still retained the privilege of admitting into the chapter only such as could show a certain number of noble ancestors, and this prerogative received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation in 1731. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> the chapter was again menaced; in 1631, Landgrave Wilhelm V of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, by virtue of a treaty with Gustavus Adolphus, received the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in fief to <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and sought gradually to make <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> predominant. After the battle of N&ouml;rdlingen, however, he no longer had power over Fulda. When the turmoil of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had ceased, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> experienced a period of peace and prosperity. In 1732 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were united, enlarged, and converted into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> raised the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> (5 Oct., 1752), with the retention of its monastic organization. The first prince-bishop was Amand von Buseck (1737-56), the collegiate chapter of one dean and fourteen capitulars being now the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter.

<p>By the Imperial Delegates' Enactment (<em>Reichsdeputationshauptschluss</em>) of 1802 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was secularized, and bestowed on the Prince of Orania as a secular principality; it embraced at this time forty sq. miles, with a population of 100,000. Under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, in 1809, it was ceded to the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>; in 1815, to Hesse-Kassel, with which, in 1866, it passed to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was closed under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of secularization, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was converted into an episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The last prince-bishop, Adalbert III von Harstall (1788-1802), died in 1814.

<p>In accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> "Provida solersque" of 1821 and "Ad dominici gregis custodiam" of 1827, the Diocese of Fulda was re-established in 1829, and made suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being Johann Adam Rieger (1829-31).

<p>In 1857 and 1871 the boundaries of the new diocese were so altered as to define the territory now embraced within it. It was seriously affected by the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> being vacant from 1873 to 1881, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> closed between 1873 and 1886; some of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities suppressed at that time have never been re-established. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1909) is Joseph Damian Schmitt, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1907.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Fulda embraces the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> administrative district of Kassel of the province of Hesse-Nassau, Bockenheim (a section of the civic circle of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a> in the administrative district of Wiesbaden), the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, and one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population in 1900 was 167,306, in 1909 about 200,000. It comprises the exempt civic district of Fulda, with 3 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 14 deaneries; for the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 150 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and curacies; 40 chaplaincies and posts as assistants; 53 administrative and teaching positions.
