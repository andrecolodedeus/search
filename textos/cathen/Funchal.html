<h1>Funchal</h1>  

<p>(FUNCHALENSIS.)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the Madeira Islands. Both in neo-Latin and in Portuguese the name of the town signifies "fennel" (Latin <em>foenicularium</em>). Madeira, the Purpuraria of the Romans, situated in the extreme west of the ancient world, about 440 miles from the coast of <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, was discovered in 1344 by the famous Bristol lovers (<em>Amantes de Bristol</em>), Anna Dorset and Robert O'Machin; later it was abandoned. In 1419 Joan Gon&ccedil;ales and Tristan Vaz took possession of the island. In 1445 were first planted the vines (brought from Crete) that have since rendered Madeira so famous. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inhabitants were subject at first to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tangier, until <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (16 June, 1514) made Funchal an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. In the interest of the vast territories in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> then subject to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> (8 July, 1539) raised Funchal to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank, and gave it for suffragans Angra, Cabo Verde, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and Santo Thom&eacute;. In 1551, however; it was reduced to simple episcopal rank, and 1570 was made a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, which it is to be present.

<p>Funchal is delightfully situated on the south side of the Madeira Islands, and was therefore the first halting place for Portuguese and Spanish ships on their way to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. Owing to this natural advantage the island soon became a great centre of wealth and foreign trade, likewise an important centre for the spread of the gospel whose missionaries found the islands convenient as a resting-place going and coming. Funchal was once to the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> what <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>, St. Helena, and Malta now are to the English. Therefore they garrisoned the city, though naturally defended by its rugged cliffs, and built there four impregnable fortresses. Its churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> no longer exhibit their former <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> splendour, though, as late as the beginning of the nineteenth century, the lintels and jambs of the windows in many houses were of massive silver, and the church vessels of solid gold (chalices, pyres, <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrances</a>) were thickly studded with pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones. Funchal has long been a favourite resort of invalids, especially those suffering from diseases of the lungs. Its white villas and editices, embowered in rich tropical vegetation, charm the traveller as he approaches from the sea. The roads and streets are quite steep and the usual means of transportation is by ox-sled. The population of the city is (1909) about 20,000. According to the "Annuaire Pontifical" for 1906, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains about 150,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 50 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 80 public and two conventual <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, all ministered to by 93 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
