<h1>Fundamental Articles</h1>  

<p>This term was employed by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to distinguish the essential parts of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> from those non-essential doctrines, which, as they believed, individual churches might accept or reject without forfeiting their claim to rank as parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universal. During the seventeenth century, the view that doctrines might be thus distinguished into two classes was widely current in the various reformed bodies; and several well-known divines endeavoured to determine the principle of the division. In some cases their aim was mainly practical. They hoped in this way to find a dogmatic basis for union between the separated churches. More often, however, the system was used controversially to defend the position of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies against the arguments of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>The first to advance the theory seems to have been <a href="../cathen/03403a.htm">George Cassander</a> (1513-66), a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> by religion, but apparently little versed in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In his work "De officio pii ac publicae tranquilitatis vere amantis viri in hoc religionis dissidio" (1561), he maintained that in the articles of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> we have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> foundations of the Faith; and that those who accept these doctrines, and have no desire to sever themselves from the rest of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> are part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. He believed that thus it might be possible to find a means of reuniting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Greeks, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. But the proposal met with no favour on either side. The <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> professors, <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hesselius</a> and <a href="../cathen/12667a.htm">Ravesteyn</a>, showed that the theory was irreconcilable with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> no less vehemently repudiated a system so little hostile to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, however, the view soon reappeared. It seemed to afford them some means of reply to two objections which they were constantly called on to meet. When <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> told them that their total inability to agree amongst themselves was itself a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that their system was a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> one, they could answer that though differing as to non-essentials they were agreed on fundamentals. And when asked how it could be maintained that the whole <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> had for centuries been sunk in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they replied that since these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> had not destroyed the fundamentals of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was possible even before the gospel had been preached. It is asserted that the first to take up this standpoint was Antonio de Dominis, the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Spalatro, who, during the reign of James I, sojourned some years in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Whether this was so or not, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that from this period the distinction becomes a recognized feature in <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestant</a> polemics, while on the other hand <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers are at pains to show its worthlessness. It fills an important place in the controversy between Father Edward Knott, S.J., and the Laudian divine, Christopher Potter. At this time, the term <em>fundamentals</em> was understood to signify those doctrines an explicit <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in which is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Thus, Potter in his "Want of Charity justly charged on all such Romanists as dare affirm that Protestancy destroyeth Salvation" (1633) says: "By Fundamental doctrines we mean such Catholique verities as are to be distinctly believed by every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> that shall be saved" (p. 211). Knott had no difficulty in showing how hopelessly discrepant were the views of the more eminent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as to what was fundamental. His attack forced his opponents to change their ground. Chillingworth, who replied to him in the notable book, "The Religion of Protestants a safe way to Salvation" (1637), while defining fundamental articles in a manner similar to Potter (op. cit., c. iii.20), nevertheless conceded that it was impossible to draw up any list of fundamental doctrines. He urged indeed that this mattered little, since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> constitutes the religion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and he who accepts the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> knows that he has accepted all the essentials of the Faith (op. cit., c. iii, n. 59). Yet it is plain that if we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which doctrines are fundamental, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> cannot be conditional on the explicit acceptance of these particular <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of fundamentals was destined to become notable not merely in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> also. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> if assumed prominence in connection with the <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">Syncretist</a> dispute. The founder of the <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">Syncretist</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was the eminent <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, George Calixt (1586-1656). A man of wide culture and pacific disposition, he desired to effect a reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. In a treatise entitled "Desiderium et studium concordiae ecclesiasticae" (1650), he argued that the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, which each of these three <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> accepted, contained the fundamental doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, and that the points on which they were at variance were no insuperable bar to union. These differences, he held, might be composed, if it were agreed to accept as <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> all that is contained in Scripture, and further all that is taught by the Fathers of the first five centuries. This eirenicon brought down upon him the most vehement attacks from the extreme party of his coreligionists, above all from Calovius, the representative of rigid <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. The keenest interest was aroused in the question, and on both sides it was warmly debated. The effort, though well meant, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> quite abortive.

<p>The most famous by far of the controversies on this subject, however, was that between <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Jurieu. Jurieu's book, "Le Vray Syst&egrave;me de l'&Eacute;glise" (1686), marks a distinct stage in the development of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; while the work in which <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> replied to him was one of the most effective attacks ever levelled against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and its system. "Le Vray Systeme" was an attempt to demonstrate the right of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestants</a> to rank as members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Universal. With this aim Jurieu propounded an entirely novel theory regarding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> essential constitution. According to him all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> without exception are members of the Body of Christ. For this nothing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> but "to belong to a general confederation, to confess Jesus Christ as Son of God, as Saviour of the world, and as Messias; and to receive the Old and New Testaments as the rule and Law of Christians", (Syst&egrave;me, p. 53).



<p>Yet among the various portions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> we must, he tells us, distinguish four classes: (1) the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which have retained all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> taught in the Scriptures; (2) those which, while retaining the more important <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, have mingled with them <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, (3) those which have retained the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, but have added doctrines which are incompatible with them; and (4) those which have set the fundamental verities altogether aside. This last class are dead members of the mystical body (ibid., p. 52). Those who have retained the fundamental articles of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are, one and all, living parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When he comes to define precisely which in doctrines are, and which are not, fundamental, Jurieu bids us fall back on the rule of <a href="../cathen/15439b.htm">Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>: <em>Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</em>. Wherever all bodies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> still existing, and possessing some importance in the world, agree in accepting a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, we have, in that agreement, a criterion which may be considered <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. Among <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> so guaranteed are, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity, of the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, of the Redemption, the satisfaction, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, creation, grace, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of punishment (ibid, 236-237). This work was followed, on 1688, by another entitled "Trait&eacute; de l'unit&eacute; de l'&Eacute;glise et des articles fondamentaux", written in reply to Nicole's criticisms. In the same year appeared <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> famous "Histoire des Variations des Eglises protestantes". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux pointed out that this was the third different theory of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> advanced by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to defend their position. The first reformers had accepted the Scriptural <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of an indefectible visible Church. When it was demonstrated that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was totally incompatible with their denunciation of pre-reformation <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, their successors took refuge in the theory of an invisible Church. It had been made patent that this was contrary to the express words of Scripture; and their controversialists had, in consequence, been compelled to look for a new' position. This Jurieu had provided in his theory of a Church founded upon fundamental articles. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> polemic was the death-blow of the new theory. Jurieu, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, replied; but only involved himself in yet farther difficulties. He argued against the main thesis of the "variations" by contending that changes of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> had been characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> from its earliest days.

<p><a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, in his "Avertissement aux Protestants sur les lettres de M. Jurieu", was not slow in pointing out that if this were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then the principle, <em>Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus</em>--according to Jurieu the criterion of a fundamental article--had ceased to possess the smallest value. (Avertissement, I, n. 22.)

<p>In regard to the relation of the fundamental doctrines to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, Jurieu is in agreement with the English divines already quoted. "By fundamental points", he says, "we understand certain general principles of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, a distinct <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in which are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (Trait&eacute;, p. 495). Precisely the same view is expressed by Locke in his "Reasonableness of Christianity". After enumerating what he regards as the fundamental <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, he says: "An explicit <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of these is absolutely required of all those to whom the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel of Jesus Christ</a> is preached, and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through his name proposed" (Works, ed., 1740, I, 583). Waterland's "Discourse of Fundamentals" should perhaps be mentioned, since it is the only work by an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> divine explicitly devoted to this subject. Its professed aim is to determine a basis for intercommunion among various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies. But the whole, treatment is quite academic. It had become patent how impossible was the task of determining which, articles were fundamental. No one could decide what should be the principle of selection.

<p>Waterland enumerates no less than ten different views on this point, which he rejects as inadequate. "We have", he says, "almost as many different rules for determinating fundamentals as there are different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> or parties." Needless to say, his own principle has as little authority as those which he rejects. The theory had, in fact, been weighed and found wanting. It afforded neither a basis for reunion nor a tenable <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as to the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From this time it appears to have ceased to occupy the attention of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers. Doubtless the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which the theory embodies still have a wide range. There are numbers today who still think that while the differences between the various bodies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are unessential, there is a residuum of fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> common to all the principal groups of believers. From time to time, this view has taken effect in efforts after partial reunion among certain of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. These events, however, fall outside our scope: for they stand in no historic connection with that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of fundamental articles, which in the seventeenth century filled so important a place in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>.

<p>It remains briefly to notice the manner in which the theory conflicts wlth <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. For a formal refutation the reader is referred to those articles in which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> in question are expressly treated.

<p>(1) In the first place the theory is repugnant to the nature of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as understood by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. According to her teaching, the essential note of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lies in the complete and unhesitating acceptance of the whole depositum on the ground that it is the revealed word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The conscious rejection of a single article of this deposit is sufficient to render a man guilty of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The question is not as to the relative importance of the article in question but solely as to whether it has been revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to man. This is clearly put by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> in the Summa Theologica II-II:5:3: "In a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who rejects a single article of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there remains the virtue of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whether as united with charity [<em>formata</em>], or as severed from charity [<em>informis</em>]. . . The formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the Supreme Truth in so far as revealed in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and in that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which proceeds from the Supreme Truth. Hence if anyone does not hold to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and divine rule, . . . he does not possess the virtue of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not deny that certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are of more vital moment than others. There are some as to which it is important that all the faithful should possess explicit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In regard to others explicit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But it denies emphatically that any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> may reject or call in question any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, small or great, revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand the system of Fundamental Artcles, in each and all of its forms, involved that while some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are of such importance that they must of necessity be held, there are others of less importance which an individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may freely deny without forfeiture of grace.

<p>(2) No less complete is the disagreement as to what is requisite in order that a body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may be a part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the system under review it is maintained that all the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which accept the Fundamental articles of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are partakers in this privilege. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> knows of one and only one test to determine this question of membership in <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's body</a>. This test does not lie in the acceptance of this or that particular <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but in communion with the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Such is the unanimous teaching of the Fathers from earliest times. By way of illustration the words of Saint Iren&aelig;us may here be cited: "They who are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", he writes, "must yield obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who have the succession from the Apostles, and who with the succession of episcopate have received . . . the sure gift of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Let them hold in suspicion those who sever themselves from the succession. These have all of them fallen from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (Adv. Haer., IV, xxvi, 2). The theory which finds the one requisite in the acceptance of a series of fundamental articles is a novelty without a vestige of support in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity.

<p>(3) It is manifest that the theory is destructive of that unity in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in corporate communion, which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself declared should for ever be the guarantee of the Divine origin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs21">John 17:21</a>), and which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has ever exemplified and taught. Jurieu, it may be noted, frankly owned that on his theory the separate <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> might be in a position of mutual <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, and yet remain members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>To sum up: the system of fundamental articles is repugnant to the religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It is a stage in the disintegration of religion, consequent on the admission of the principle of private judgment in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and it is a stage which is necessarily destined to lead on to the complete rejection of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.
