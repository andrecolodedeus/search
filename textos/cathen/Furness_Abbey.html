<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Furness Abbey</h1>  

<p>Situated in the north of Lancashire about five miles from the town of Ulverston. Originally a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Savigny Reform it afterwards became <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>. Vitalis, the founder of Savigny and the disciple of <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Robert d'Arbrissel</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1119, and Stephen, Count of Boulogne and afterwards King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, offered him land at Tulketh on the Ribble, one mile below Preston. Accordingly, in 1124, Ewan d'Avranches, with a colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, was sent from Savigny to establish the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Tulketh. In 1127 Stephen gave to these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> his forest of Furness in Lancashire and thither they removed. This grant was most munificent, for it included large possessions in woods, pastures, fisheries, and mills, with a large share in the salt works and mines of the district. Development was so rapid that in 1134 a colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was sent forth to establish Calder near the Scotch border. Besides Calder, Swyneshead and Rushin were also colonized, and from Calder the famous Abbey of Byland was founded. By the year 1148 the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Reform, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, was everywhere attracting attention and all the Savigny <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, those of Furness included, became <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. In 1249 the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> General Chapter placed four <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> under the control of Furness, viz. Fermoy, Wethirlaghn, Inislounagh, and Corcumcrae. Through the foundation of Rushin there was frequent communication between Furness and the Isle of Man and more than one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Furness became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Man. This, no doubt, was due to the privilege held by the Abbey of Rushin of appointing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, subject to the consent of the Manxmen. Nicholas de Meaux, a native of the Orkneys and once a canon of Wartre, was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Meaux, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Furness, and finally <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Man. Jocelin, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Furness and afterwards of Iniscourcy, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, wrote the life of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> at the command of Thomas, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>; other works attributed to him are: "Book of British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>"; "Life of St. Waldeve, Second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Melrose"; "Life of St. Kentigern or Mungo". The names of thirty-two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Furness are known, the last being Roger Pyle. In October, 1535, the royal commissioners visited the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; a little later the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were accused of being implicated in the <a href="../cathen/12084b.htm">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> and two of them were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Lancaster. The final disruption came on 9 April, 1537, when the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, prior, and twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were forced to sign the deed of surrender. The site and lands were at first held by the Crown. Later they were assigned to the Earl of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> and afterwards came into the possession of the Prestons of Preston Patrick. They were next acquired by Lord George Augustus Cavendish, and now belong to the Dukes of Devonshire. The buildings were renowned more for their grandeur than for their richness and beauty; portions of the ruins still remain to show this.
