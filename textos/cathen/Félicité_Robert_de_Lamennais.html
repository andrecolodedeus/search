<h1>F&eacute;licit&eacute; Robert de Lamennais</h1>  

<p>Born at Saint-Malo, 29 June, 1782; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 27 February, 1854. His father, Pierre Robert de Lamennais (or La Mennais), was a respectable merchant of Saint-Malo, ennobled by Louis XVI at the request of the Estates of Brittany in acknowledgment of his patriotic devotion. Of the six children born of his marriage with Gratienne Lorin, the best-known are <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Jean-Marie</a> and F&eacute;licit&eacute;. The latter, though delicate and frail in physique, early exhibited an exuberant nature, a lively but indocile intelligence, a brilliant but highly impressionable <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and a will resolute to obstinacy and vehement to excess.
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>At the age of five Lamennais lost his mother: his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, absorbed in business, was thus <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confide the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Jean-Marie</a> and F&eacute;licit&eacute; to Robert des Saudrais, the brother-in-law of his wife, who had no children of his own. <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Jean-Marie</a> and F&eacute;licit&eacute; &#151; or F&eacute;li, as he was called in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> &#151; were taken to live with their uncle at La Ch&ecirc;naie, an estate not far from Saint-Malo, which F&eacute;licit&eacute; was afterwards to make famous. At La Ch&ecirc;naie there was a well filled <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in which works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> books were mingled with the ancient classics and the works of the eighteenth-century <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. F&eacute;licit&eacute; was not very docile at his lessons, and, to punish him, M. des Saudrais would sometimes shut him up in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The child acquired a taste for the books he found around him, and read voraciously and indiscriminately all that came to his hands, good and bad. He even multiplied reasons for being shut up in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, abandoned himself there to his favorite reading, and made such rapid progress that he was soon able to read the classical authors without difficulty. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> was then at its height; the proscribed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, or to continue from hiding-places their sacred ministrations at the peril of their lives. The Lamennais household afforded an asylum to one such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Abb&eacute; Vielle, who sometimes said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> at La Ch&ecirc;naie in the middle of the night. F&eacute;licit&eacute;, who used to assist at the Divine services, derived from these early impressions a lasting and lively <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. At the same time, his unwise reading, especially of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, seduced his ardent mind and prejudiced him against religion. These prejudices found vent in objections which moved his confessor to postpone indefinitely his First Communion.

<p>His father at first intended Lamennais to join him in his business, but the youth obeyed without enthusiasm. Always ill-at-ease in the office, he visited it as little as possible, and gave to reading all the time he could steal from his regular occupation. While he thus succeeded in completing his literary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and acquiring foreign languages, these studies undertaken without teachers or guidance necessarily left gaps in his training, and made him liable to contract dangerous habits of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> intolerance. The passions, too, gained a certain mastery over him, drawing him into lapses which he says, not without some exaggeration, in a letter written in 1809 to his friend Brute de R&eacute;mur, the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes in <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, "the most rigorous austerities, the severest penance would not suffice to expiate". The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> influence of his brother <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Jean-Marie</a>, who had recently (1804) been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, rescued him from this condition. Restored to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiments, he made his First Communion, and resolved to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> himself to the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He withdrew to La Ch&ecirc;naie and there gave himself up under his brother's direction to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, briefly interrupted (January to July, 1806) to reestablish his threatened health by a sojourn at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was then in a struggling and precarious condition, being deprived of material resources and served but poorly by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> either enfeebled by age or inadequately prepared to meet the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> demands of the time. The two brothers set themselves to labor as best they could for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the common task which they imposed on themselves with this aim, the part that fell to F&eacute;licit&eacute;, as being the better suited to his tastes, was chiefly <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and literary. In fact the story of his life is almost entirely contained in his books and articles. The first result of the joint labors soon appeared in a book published in 1808 under the title "R&eacute;flexions sur l'&eacute;tat de l'&Eacute;glise en France pendant le dix-huitieme siecle et sur sa situation actuelle". The first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of this work and the materials were due to <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Jean-Marie</a>, but the actual writing was done almost exclusively by F&eacute;licit&eacute;. After describing the evils under which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> labored in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the authors point out the causes and propose remedies, among others provincial councils, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, retreats, ecclesiastical conferences, community life, and proper methods in recruiting the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Many of these views were calculated to offend the imperial government; the book was suppressed by the police, and was not republished until after the fall of the Empire. Meanwhile, the two brothers had left La Ch&ecirc;naie for the College of St-Malo, in which they had been appointed professors. F&eacute;licit&eacute; was to teach mathematics; for he had to earn a living now that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, already financially injured by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the Convention, saw his business ruined by the Continental Blockade, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to surrender all his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to his creditors. This <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college having been closed by imperial authority, F&eacute;licit&eacute; withdrew to La Ch&ecirc;naie, while his brother was called, as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, to Saint-Brieuc. There F&eacute;licit&eacute; completed another work, in which also he had his brother's collaboration, and which was to have been printed and published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1814. In opposition to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, who wished to transfer the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, the two brothers vindicated the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> exclusive claim to the <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This work marked the beginning of Lamennais' long struggle against Gallicanism. However, the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, coming some months before the book appeared, made it no longer appropriate, and it thus obtained only a <em>succ&egrave;s d' estime</em>. Lamennais next published a violent article against the imperial <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; indeed, when <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> returned from <a href="../cathen/05371c.htm">Elba</a>, the young writer, thinking himself insecure in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, went over to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he found a temporary asylum with M. Carron, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who had established in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the children of <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> after the Hundred Days, Lamennais made M. Carron his confidant and took up his residence near him in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Under the influence of this worthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and on the advice of M. Beysserre, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, he decided, though not without strong repugnance and some sharp prickings of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to take <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 9 March, 1817.


<h2>Struggle against infidelity and Gallicanism</h2>

<p>Towards the end of the same year appeared the first volume of the "Essai sur l'indiff&eacute;rence en mati&egrave;re de religion". From beginning to end the book was a vigorous attack on that indifference which appears (1) among those who, seeing in religion nothing but a political institution, think it a necessity only for the masses; (2) among those who admit the necessity of a religion for all men, but reject Revelation; (3) among those who recognize the necessity of a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, but think it permissible to deny all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which that religion teaches with the exception of certain fundamental articles. While open to some criticism in regard to the development of its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the force of some of the arguments employed, the "Essai" brought to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> a new strength and brilliancy, and at once commanded public attention. Not content with a defensive attitude in the presence of incredulity, it attacks the enemy boldly, supported by all the resources of dialectic, invective, irony, and eloquence. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and all <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> thrilled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and hope, when this champion entered the lists armed as none since <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, for it was indeed with <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> that this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, yesterday unknown, was now compared. In the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre-Dame of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Frayssinous hailed Lamennais as the greatest thinker since <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>. Meanwhile, editions of the "Essai" came rapidly from the press; 40,000 copies were sold within a few weeks, it was translated into many foreign languages, and its perusal effected in some places notable returns, in others brilliant conversions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Some of these converts, such as Mme de Lacan (afterwards, by her second marriage, the Baroness Cottu), Beno&icirc;t d' Azy, Senfft-Pilsach, thenceforth carried on an uninterrupted epistolary correspondence with Lamennais. These letters, with others published since then or about to be published (addressed to such friends as Mlle Cornulier de Lucini&egrave;re, de Vitrolles, <a href="../cathen/04370a.htm">Coriolis</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a>, Marion, Vaurin, David Richard), add considerably to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his writings, and are not the least interesting part of his works. With their aid we can witness the intimate workings from day to day of a mobile and impressionable mind; in them we perceive an aspect of his character which so seldom appears in his other works his loving, kind, and tender disposition, lavish in devotion and of a timidity which sought a refuge in outspokenness.

<p>Lamennais was now looked upon as the most eminent <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> among the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; visitors flocked to see him; the press solicited his contributions. He promised his collaboration to "Le Conservateur", a royalist paper of the Extreme Right party, for which <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a> and de Bonald were writing. Lamennais, however, cared much less for politics than for religion, and contributed to "Le Conservateur" only in defense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. For him it was not enough to discredit infidel philosophy: he meant to put something else in its place. He believed that the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> which had recently attacked the foundations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, and therefore necessarily of human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, could be combated by a system which should firmly re-establish both. To this object he devoted the second volume of the "Essai", published in 1820. The philosophic system which he expounded in this volume was based on a new theory of certitude. In the main, his theory is that certitude cannot be given by the individual reason; it belongs only to the general reason, that is to the universal consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the <em>common</em> sense; it is derived from the unanimous testimony of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Certitude, therefore, is not created by evidence, but by the authority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; it is a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, not the result of free enquiry. In the last chapters of the book this philosophic system supports an entirely new method of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>. There exists, says Lamennais, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and there exists but one, which is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and to social order. Only one criterion will enable us to discern the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion from the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and that criterion is the authority of testimony. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, therefore, is that which can put forth on its own behalf the greatest number of witnesses. This is the case with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, or rather the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. It is in reality the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the only religion which began with the world and perpetuates itself with it. The result of a primitive revelation, this unique religion has perfected itself in the course of ages without being essentially modified; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> now believe all that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has believed, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has always believed what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> believe. The last two volumes of the "Essai" (1823) were devoted to this thesis. In these he attempts to prove, with the aid of history, that the chief <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> have been and are still, under various disguises, professed throughout the world. Naturally, these later volumes failed to secure the success which the first had attained.

<p>The philosophic system of Lamennais, like his <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, called forth serious objections. It was pointed out that this philosophy and <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> favored scepticism by denying the validity of individual reason. If the latter can furnish no certitude, how can we expect any from the general reason, which is but a synthesis of individual reasons? It was also a confusion of the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> orders, of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, to base both alike on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and, since according to him both alike are based on human testimony, religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was at once reduced to human <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. These criticisms and others irritated Lamennais without convincing him of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; he submitted his book to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, in reply to his critics, wrote the "D&eacute;fense de l'Essai" (1821). <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> confined its intervention to giving its <em>imprimatur</em> to an Italian translation of the "D&eacute;fense de l'Essai". Lamennais himself soon visited the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> received him very kindly and at one time even thought of making him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, despite his excitable character and exaggerated <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Lamennais showed a greater determination than ever to combat Gallicanism and irreligious <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>. On the occasion of a ministerial ordinance prescribing the teaching of the famous Declaration of 1682 (see <a href="../cathen/06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>, VI, 384), he published his "Religion consid&eacute;r&eacute;e dans ses rapports avec l'ordre civil et politique" (1825), in which he denounced Gallican and Liberal tendencies as the joint causes of the harm done to religion, and as equally fatal to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Irritated by these attacks, a majority of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were moderate Gallicans, signed a protest against this pamphlet which accused them of leanings towards <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Lamennais was also cited before the Tribunal of the Seine for attacking the king's government and the Four Articles of 1682 in their character of existing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Defended by his friend, the great advocate <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a>, he escaped with a fine of thirty francs. From this incident he conceived a lively hostility to the Bourbons, and was all the more energetic in maintaining ultramontane <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> against Frayssinous, Clausel de Montals, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and other representatives of moderate Gallican principles.

<p>On the other hand, he derived valuable assistance from a certain number of young men, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who gradually formed a group of which he was the centre. Of these the best known are <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, de Salinis, <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, <a href="../cathen/13117c.htm">Rohrbacher</a>, Combalot, Maurice de Gu&eacute;rin, Charles de Sainte-Foy, Eug&egrave;ne and L&eacute;on Bor&eacute;, de Herc&eacute;. With them Lamennais founded the "Congr&eacute;gation de St. Pierre", a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whose distinctive <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to defend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, by propagating Roman doctrines, by teaching in colleges and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, by giving missions and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a>. Hardly had this congregation come into existence when Mgr. Dubois, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York, appealed to it to supply teachers to the Catholic University which it was then proposed to found in that city. The Revolution of 1830 put an end to this project. The congregation at one time possessed three houses &#151; La Ch&ecirc;naie, Malestroit, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> &#151; but it lived only about four years. Obliged to reckon with the demands of the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, whom the elections had returned to the Chamber of Deputies, the government of Charles X had revived (15 June, 1828) former legislative enactments against the religious congregations &#151; particularly against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, eight of whose colleges were closed. Although ill-disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on account of their lack of sympathy for his philosophic system, Lamennais took up their defense in a book published in 1829 under the title "Progr&egrave;s de la R&eacute;volution et de la guerre contre l'&Eacute;glise". His attacks spared neither the king nor the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whom he reproached with their Gallicanism and their concessions to the enemies of religion. Here, for the first time, Lamennais openly broke with monarchy, setting his highest hopes upon political liberty and equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. "An immense liberty", he said "is indispensable for the development of those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are to save the world." This was what he called "catholicizing <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">liberalism</a>". The work met with enormous success. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves protested almost unanimously against the Government's action. Not, however, that they approved of Lamennais' violent language; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in a pastoral charge even condemned the work, and this drew from Lamennais two open letters in which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were unreservedly criticized.

<p>When the Revolution broke out the next year (July, 1830), sweeping the Bourbons away and lifting the House of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> to the throne, Lamennais beheld without regret the departure of the one, and without enthusiasm the accession of the other dynasty. "Most people", he writes in his letters, "would prefer a republic frankly declared; I am of that number" Thenceforward he thought only of the defense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> against the triumphant party, who never forgave it the favor it had enjoyed from the fallen monarchy. While laboring to ward off the danger which menaced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he hoped at the same time to ensure its social triumph by setting up its defense on the basis of equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, uniting its cause with that of public liberties. With this end in view he founded the journal "L'Avenir" (16 October, 1830) and his "General Agency for the Defense of Religious Liberty". With <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and de Coux, he waged a grim battle in defense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> against the hostility of the government, of Roman <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> against the Gallicanism of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and of his system of the "common sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>" against <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> philosophy. The force of his blows, the boldness of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, his outspoken sympathy for every people then in a state of revolt, provoked new accusations against him and gave rise to suspicion of his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. To set himself right in the face of all this hostility, he suspended the publication of "L'Avenir" (15 November, 1831), and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to submit his cause to <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. Though accompanied by <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> and <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, he did not find there the pronounced welcome of 1824. He waited a long time, but received no definite answer: then some days after his departure from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, appeared the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Mirari vos" (15 August, 1832), in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, without expressly designating him, condemned some of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> advanced in "L'Avenir" liberty of the press, liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, revolt against princes, the need of regenerating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, etc. At the same time a letter from <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a> informed Lamennais that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been pained to see him discuss publicly questions which belonged to the authorities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>Lamennais out of the Church</h2>

<p>Having forthwith declared that out of deference to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he would not resume the publication of "L'Avenir" Lamennais suppressed the "General Agency", went back to La Ch&ecirc;naie, and there apparently kept silence. In his heart, however, he cherished deep resentment, the echoes of which reached the outer world through his correspondence. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was stirred by this behavior, and demanded frank and full adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Mirari vos". After seeming to yield, Lamennais ended by refusing to submit without reserve or qualification. Little by little, he began by renouncing his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions (December, 1833) and ended by abandoning all outward profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The amelioration of humanity, devotion to the welfare of the people and of popular liberties, dominated him more and more. In May, 1834, he published the "Paroles d'un croyant", through the apocalyptic diction of which resounds a violent cry of rage against the established social order: in it he denounces what he calls the conspiracy of kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> against the people. In this way he loudly declared his rupture with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and set up the symbol of his new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> hastened to condemn in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Singulari nos" (15 July, 1834) this book, "small in size, but immense in perversity", and at the same time censured the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system of Lamennais. One after another, all his friends abandoned him, and, as if to break finally with his own past, Lamennais wrote a volume on "Les Affaires de Rome", in which he set forth, very much in his own favor, his relations with <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. After this he published only works inspired by his new democratic tendencies, repeating with no great show of originality the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Les Paroles d'un croyant", the whole foundation of which consisted of a few humanitarian commonplaces, relieved here and there with vague <a href="../cathen/14062a.htm">socialism</a>. The Government having in 1835 caused the arrest of 121 revolutionaries in connection with certain disturbances, Lamennais consented to undertake the defense of his new friends before the Peers. Besides some articles in the "Revue des Deux Mondes", the "Revue du Progr&egrave;s" and "Le Monde", he published a series of pamphlets, e.g. "Le Livre du peuple" (1839), "L'Esclavage moderne" (1839), "Discussions critiques" (1841), "Du passe et de l'avenir du peuple" (1841), "Amschaspands et Darvands" (1843). In these writings he expounds his views on the future of democracy or vents his rage against <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the public authorities. One of his works, "Le Pays et le Gouvernement" (1840) brought down on him a year's <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, which he served in 1841.

<p>Mention should here be made of his "Esquisse d'une philosophie", published from 1841 to 1846. It comprises a treatise on <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, man, and nature are studied by the light of reason only. Many of the opinions maintained in this book remind one that it was begun when its author was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but there are many others which betray his later evolution; he denies in formal terms the fall of man, the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, eternal punishment, and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. The portions of the work devoted to &aelig;sthetics are among the finest that Lamennais ever wrote, while the general tone breathes a spirit of serenity and calm. To this epoch, too, belongs the translation of the Gospels, with anti-Christian notes and reflections. It was not the first work of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that Lamennais had published. From 1809 he had devoted his moments of leisure to the translation of the "Spiritual Guide" of Louis de Blois. In 1824 he published a French version of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> with notes and reflections, more widely read than any of his works. Then came the "Guide du premier &acirc;ge", the "Journ&eacute;e du Chr&eacute;tien", and a "Recueil de pi&eacute;t&eacute;" (1828). To spread this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> literature he had become connected with a publishing house, the failure of which led to his financial ruin..

<p>The Revolution of 1848 brought to Lamennais a renewal of hope and celebrity. He was elected a deputy for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the Constituent and in the Legislative Assemblies. His plan of a constitution, however, met with no success, and thereafter he confined himself to silent participation in the sessions. He was not more fortunate in a newspaper, "Le Peuple constituant", in which he made common cause with the worst revolutionaries; its existence ended after four months, through failure to furnish its <em>cautionnement</em>. The <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> of 1851 put an end to the political career of Lamennais, who relapsed into misery and isolation. Numerous attempts were made to bring him back to religion and to repentance, but in vain. He died rejecting all religious ministration, and after requesting that his body "be carried to the cemetery, without being presented at any church".

<p>However regrettable his end, it does not efface the memory of Lamennais' great services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When that Church lay bleeding from the blows inflicted on it by the Revolution, and intimidated by the insolent triumph of infidel philosophy, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her relief, both absolute devotion and abilities of the highest order. He was the first <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> to compel the attention of unbelievers in the nineteenth century, and to force them to reckon with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. He was the first who dared to attack Gallicanism publicly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and prepared the way for its defeat, the crowning work of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. To him also belongs the honor of having inaugurated the struggle which was to issue in freedom of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (<em>libert&eacute; d'enseignement</em>). Despite his justly blamable excesses, we must trace to him that reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> on the one hand and popular liberty and the masses of the people on the other, upon which <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> set the final seal of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. If a temper impatient of all restraint and a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> overconfident in its own conceits deprived him of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> which he was instrumental in securing for others, this is surely no reason why the beneficiaries should forget to whom they owe their happier condition.
