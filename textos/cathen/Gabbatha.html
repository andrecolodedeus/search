<h1>Gabbatha</h1>  

<p>The Aramaic appellation of a place in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, designated also under the Greek name of Lithostrotos. It occurs only in <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs13">John 19:13</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> states that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> "brought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha." The name "Gabbatha" is certainly an Aramaic word, for by "Hebrew" St. John, like other <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writers, denotes the Aramaic language which was spoken commonly at the time in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. It is not a mere translation of "Lithostrotos", which properly means the tessellated or <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> pavement whereon stood the judgment-seat, but which was extended to the place itself in front of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> pr&aelig;torium, where that pavement was laid. This was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the practice of St. John, who elsewhere gives Aramaic names as distinctly belonging to places, not as mere translations of the Greek. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> also by the fact that "Gabbatha" is derived from a root (meaning "back", or "elevation"), which refers, not to the kind of pavement, but to the "elevation" of the place in question. It thus appears that the two names "Lithostrotos" and "Gabbatha" were due to different characteristics of the spot where <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> delivered <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to death. The Aramaic name was derived from the configuration of that spot, the Greek name from the nature of its pavement. Efforts have been made by <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> to identify "Gabbatha" either with the outer court of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, which is known to have been paved, or with the meeting-place of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Great Sanhedrin</a>, which was half within, half without that Temple's outer court, or again with the ridge at the back of the House of the Lord; but these efforts cannot be considered as successful. The only that can be gathered with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> from <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John's</a> statement (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs13">19:13</a>) is that "Gabbatha" denotes the usual place in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had his judicial seat, and whither he caused <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to be brought forth, that he might deliver in His hearing, and in that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> multitude, his formal and final sentence of condemnation.
