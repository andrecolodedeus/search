<h1>Gabriel Biel</h1>  

<p>Called "the last of the Scholastics", b. at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, c. 1425; d. at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, 1495. His studies were pursued at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> and Erfurt. While still a young man, he was noted as a preacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, of which he was vicar. Later he became superior of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">"Clerics of the Common Life"</a> at Butzbach, and in 1479 was appointed <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the church in Urach. At this period he co-operated with Count Eberhard of Wurtemberg in founding the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>. Appointed in 1484 the first professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the new institution, he continued the most celebrated member of its faculty until his death. Though he was almost sixty years of age when he began to teach, Biel's work, both as professor and as writer, reflected the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on the young <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. His first publication, on the Canon of the Mass, is of permanent interest and value. His second and most important work is a commentary on the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. In this he calls Occam his master, but the last three books show him more <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotist</a> than Nominalist. <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a> describes him as "one of the best of the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>, clear, exact, and more positive as well as more loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than any of the others" (Dogmatik, no. 1073). The historian <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Janssen</a> declares that he was one of the few <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> who erected a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system without incurring the charge of unorthodoxy. (Cf. Geschichte des deutschen Volkes, I, 127, 15th ed.) He was neither narrow nor excessively speculative. Though a Nominalist, he was tolerant of Realism, which also flourished at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> under the leadership of Konrad Summenhart. A <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>, he was, to quote <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Janssen</a>, "free from empty speculations and ingenious <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> juggling, being concerned with questions and needs of actual life" (ibidem), was interested in the social movements of his time, and maintained friendly relations with the Humanists. One of the latter, Heinrich Bebel, gave him the title of "monarch among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>". His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings were repeatedly brought into the discussions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<p>Living as he did in a transition period, Biel exhibits characteristics of two <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> eras. According to some, he was a <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> who expounded <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> rather than the Scriptures; according to others, he defended freer <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teaching, and opposed the ancient constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. As a matter of fact, he acknowledged the primacy and supreme power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, but, in common with many other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his time, maintained the superiority of <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, at least to the extent that they could compel the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> resignation. And he displayed no more <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> freedom than has been claimed and exercised by some of the strictest <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Among the opinions defended by Biel concerning matters controverted in his day, the following are worthy of mention: (A) That all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, even that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, is derived either immediately or mediately from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In this connection it is to be noted that his defence of the episcopal claims of Diether von Ysenburg won him thanks of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. (B) That the power of absolving is inherent in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> orders, and that only the matter, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be absolved, can be conceded or withheld by the ordinary. (c) That the minister of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> need have no more specific intention than that of doing what the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, intends. (d) That the State may not compel <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, or their children to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. (e) And that the <em>Contractus Trinus</em> is morally lawful. All of these opinions have since become the prevailing <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>The subject on which Biel held the most progressive views is political economy. Roscher, who with Schmoller introduced him to modern students of economics, declares that Biel's grasp of economics enabled him not only to understand the work of his predecessors, but to advance beyond them. (Cf. Geschicte der Nationalokonomik in Deutschland, 21 sqq.) According to Biel, the just price of a commodity is determined chiefly by human needs, by its scarcity, and by the difficulty of producing it. His enumeration includes all the factors that govern market price, and is more complete and reasonable than any made by his predecessors. (Cf. Garnier, L'id&eacute;e du just prix, 77.) The same author maintains that concerning the occupation of the merchant or trader, Biel is more advanced than <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, since he attaches no stigma to it, but holds it to be good in itself, and the merchant entitled to remuneration because of his labour, risks, and expense. Biel's discussion of these subjects is contained in book IV of his commentary on the "Sentences". He wrote a special work on currency, <em>ein wahrhaft goldenes Buch</em>, in which he stigmatizes the debasing of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> by princes as dishonest exploitation of the people. In the same work he severely condemns those rulers who curtailed the popular <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of forest, meadow, and water, and who imposed arbitrary burdens of taxation, as well as the rich sportsmen who encroached upon the lands of the peasantry. His works are: "Sacri canonis Missae expositio resolutissima literalis et mystica" (Brixen, 1576); an abridgment of this work, entitled "Epitome expositionis canonis Missae" (Antwerp, 1565); "Sermones" (Brixen, 1585), on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals of the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Christian year</a>, with a disquisition on the plague and a defence of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; "Collectorium sive epitome in magistri sententiarum libros IV" (Brixen, 1574); "Tractatus de potestate et utilitate monetarum".
