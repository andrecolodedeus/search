<h1>Gabriel Daniel</h1>  

<p>Historian and controversialist, born at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 8 Feb., 1649; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 23 June, 1728. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1667, and after making his last <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, 1683, was assigned to the professed house of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where his extraordinary talents resulted in his being appointed historiographer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. Of the published writings of Father Daniel, consisting of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, and historical treatises, many have been translated into German, English, Spanish, Italian, and Latin. In the first class perhaps the most famous was the oft-reprinted "Voyage du mondede Descartes", a refutation of the vortex theory of that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. His refutation of <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal's</a> "Provincial Letters", which underwent several revisions and reprints, and his published correspondence with <a href="../cathen/01296c.htm">Natalis Alexander</a> respecting the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestination</a>, etc., stand out conspicuously among his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works. He published also many shorter works, principally against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, and one volume of a projected course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>.

<p>But it is as the author of the celebrated "Histoirede France" that Father Daniel has achieved his most lasting fame. This work in seventeen volumes was the fruit of his ripest years and was the most complete and accurate history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that had then appeared (1713). It is still valuable, though overshadowed by more recent works. It went through many editions, and an abridgment of it in eight volumes made by the author was translated into German, English, and Italian. Besides this, a valuable work from original sources, the "Histoire de la milice fran&ccedil;aise", contributed much to Daniel's reputation as a scholarly historian. The best edition of his great history is that of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1755-60), in seventeen quarto volumes.
