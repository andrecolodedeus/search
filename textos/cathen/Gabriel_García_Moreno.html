<h1>Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Moreno</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> patriot and statesman; b. at <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, 24 December, 1821; assassinated at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, 6 August, 1875. His father, Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Gomez, a native of Villaverde, in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>, had been engaged in commerce at Callao before removing to <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, where he married Dona Mercedes Moreno, the mother of the future <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> president. Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Gomez died while his son was still young, and the boy's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was left to the care of his mother, who appears to have been a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of unusual ability for her task; she was, moreover, fortunate in securing as her son's tutor Fray Jos&eacute; Betancourt, the famous <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarian</a>, under whose tuition young Garc&iacute;a Moreno made rapid progress. A great part of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> fortune having been lost, it was not without some considerable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> that the youth was able to attend the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>. These material obstacles once overcome, he passed brilliantly through the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, distancing all his contemporaries, and on 26 October, 1844, received his degree in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<em>Doctor en Jurisprudencia</em>) from the University of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>.

<p>In less than a year after his graduation young Garc&iacute;a Moreno had begun to take an active part in <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> politics, joining in the revolutionary movement which eventually replaced the Flores administration by that of Roca (1846). He soon distinguished himself as a political satirist by contributions to "El Zurriago", but what more truly presaged the achievements of his riper life was his good and useful work as a member of the municipal council of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>. At the same time he was studying legal practice, and on 30 March, 1848, was admitted advocate. Immediately after this the deposed Flores, supported by the Spanish government, made an attempt to regain the presidency of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>; Garc&iacute;a Moreno unhesitatingly came forward in support of the Roca administration, and when that administration fell, in 1849, he entered upon his first period of exile. After some months spent in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he returned to his native republic in the employ of a mercantile concern, and it was then that he took the first decisive step which marked him conspicuously for the enmity of the anti-Catholics, or, as they preferred to call themselves, the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>. At Panama he had fallen in with a party of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who had been expelled from the <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">Republic of New Granada</a> and wished to find asylum in <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. Garc&iacute;a Moreno constituted himself the protector of these religious, and they sailed with him for <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>; but on the same vessel that carried the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and their champion, an envoy from <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a> also took passage for the express purpose of bringing diplomatic influence to bear with the dictator, Diego Noboa, to secure their exclusion from <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> territory. No sooner had the vessel entered the harbour of <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> than Garc&iacute;a Moreno, slipping into a shore boat, succeeded in landing some time before the <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granadan</a> envoy; the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> permission was acquired from the <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> government, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> obtained a foothold in that country. How soon the report of this exploit spread among the anti-Catholics of South America was evidenced by the fact that within a year Jacobo S&aacute;nchez, a <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granadan</a>, had attacked Garc&iacute;a Moreno in the pamphlet "Don Felix Frias en Paris y los Jesuitas en el Ecuador", to which Garc&iacute;a Moreno's reply was an able "Defensa de los Jesuitas".

<p>In 1853 he began to publish "La Naci&oacute;n", a periodical which, according to its prospectus, was intended to combat the then existing tendency of the government to exploit the masses for the material benefit of those who happened to be in power. At the same time Garc&iacute;a Moreno's programme aimed distinctly and professedly to defend the religion of the people. He was already known as a friend of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; he now assumed the role of friend of the common people, to which he adhered sincerely and consistently to the day of his death. The Urbina faction, then in power, were quick to recognize the importance of "La Naci&oacute;n", which was suppressed before the appearance of its third number, and its proprietor was exiled, for the second time. Having been, meanwhile, elected senator by his native province of <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, he was prevented from taking his seat, on the ground that he had returned to <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> without a passport. After a sojourn at Paita, Garc&iacute;a Moreno once more visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He was now thirty-three years of age, and his experience of political life in <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> had deeply convinced him of his people's need of enlightenment. It was undoubtedly with this conviction as his guide and incentive that he spent a year or more in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, foregoing every form of pleasure, a severe, indefatigable student not only of political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, but also of the higher mathematics, of chemistry, and of the French public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system. On his return home, under a general amnesty in 1850, he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the central University of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>; a position of which he availed himself to commence lectures of his own in physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Next year he was active in the senate in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Masonic</a> party, which had gained control of the government, while at the same time he persistently and forcibly, though unsuccessfully, struggled for the passage of a law establishing a system of public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> modelled on that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1858 he once more established a paper, "La Union Naci&oacute;nal", which became obnoxious to the government by its fearless exposure of corruption and its opposition to the arbitrary employment of authority; and once more a political crisis ensued.

<p>Garc&iacute;a Moreno was on principle an advocate of orderly processes of government, and that his professions in this regard were sincere his subsequent career fairly demonstrated, but at this juncture he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to realize that his country was in the grip of a corrupt oligarchy, bent upon the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which the whole mass of his fellow countrymen were devoted, and disposed to keep the masses in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> so as to sway them the more easily to its own ends. He had, years before, attacked "the revolutionary industry", a phrase probably first used by him, in the prospectus of "La Naci&oacute;n"; it now became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for him to descend to revolutionary methods. Besides, the little Republic of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> was at this time menaced by its more powerful neighbour on the south, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. Garc&iacute;a Moreno, if he was sure of opposition at the hands of the soi-disant <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, was also, by this time, recognized by the masses as a leader loyal to both their common Faith and their common country, and thus he was able to organize the revolution which made him head of a provisional government established at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>. The republic was now divided, General Franco being at the head of a rival government established at <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>. In vain did Garc&iacute;a Moreno offer to share his authority with his rival for the sake of national unity. As a defensive measure against the threat of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> invasion, Garc&iacute;a Moreno entered into negotiations with the French envoy with a view to securing the protection of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a political mistake of which his enemies <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to avail themselves to the utmost. He was now <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to assume the character of a military leader, for which he possessed at least the qualifications of personal <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and decisive quickness of resolution. While Garc&iacute;a Moreno inflicted one defeat after another upon the partisans of Franco, the latter, as representing <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, had concluded with <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> the treaty of Mapasingue. The people of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> rose in indignation at the concessions made in this treaty, and Franco, even his own followers being alienated, was defeated at Babahoya (7 August, 1860) and again at Salado River, where he was driven to take refuge on a <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> vessel. When his adversary had been forcibly driven from the country, Garc&iacute;a Moreno showed his magnanimity in the proclamation in which he sought to heal as quickly as possible the scars of this civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: "The republic should regard itself as one <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; the old demarcations of districts must be so obliterated as to render sectional ambitions impossible". In the reorganization of the Constituent Assembly, which was summoned to meet in January, 1861, he insisted that the suffrage should not be territorial, but "direct and universal, under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> guarantees of intelligence and morality, and the number of representatives should correspond (proportionally) to that of the electors represented". The Convention, which met on 10 January, elected Garc&iacute;a Moreno president; he delivered his inaugural address on the 2d of April following. Then began that series of reforms among which were the restitution of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and a radical reconstruction of the fiscal system. In the immediate present he had to deal with the machinations of his old adversary Urbina, who, from his retirement in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, kept up incessant intrigues with the opposition at home, and still more with the governments of neighbouring republics. Garc&iacute;a Moreno soon came to a sensible and honourable understanding with the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> government.



<p>A violation of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> territory by <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>, though it led to a hostile collision in which Garc&iacute;a Moreno himself took part, had no serious consequences until the Arboledo administration gave place to that of General Mosquera, whose <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> it was to make <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a> the nucleus of a great "Colombian Confederation", in which <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> was to be included. Urbina was not above writing encouraging letters to the <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granadan</a> or Colombian dictator who was scheming against the independence of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. An invitation to Garc&iacute;a Moreno to confer with Mosquera elicited a very plain intimation that, so far as the national obliteration of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> was concerned, there was nothing to confer about. But in the meantime the Republic of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> had ratified a concordat with <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> (1862), and the discontent of the Regalista party at home with the provisions of that instrument gave Mosquera an excellent pretext for encroaching upon his neighbour's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The Regalistas were, without knowing it, a kind of Erastians, who claimed the appointment to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> as an inalienable right of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. The President of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> was charged with "casting Colombia, manacled, at the feet of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>"; Urbina issued "manifestos" from <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> in the sense of "South America for the South Americans"; while the proclamation of President Mosquera recited, with others which seem to have been introduced merely for the sake of appearances, his three really significant grounds of complaint against Garc&iacute;a Moreno: that the latter had ratified the concordat; that he maintained a representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>; that he had brought <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> into <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. It may be remarked here, in passing, that if Mosquera had added to this catalogue of offences those of insisting upon free primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for the masses, upon strict auditing of the public accounts, and a considerable bona fide outlay upon roads and other public utilities, his proclamation might have served adequately as the indictment upon which Garc&iacute;a Moreno was condemned and eventually <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by those whom <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> ironically called "the valiant sectaries".

<p>Mosquera was determined to have <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and all the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> government were of no avail to prevent it. At the battle of Cuaspud all but two battalions of the forces of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> fled ignominiously. It is a matter for wonder, considering the grounds upon which he had declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, that Mosquera, in the Peace of Pinsaqu&iacute;, which followed this victory, should have left the Concordat of 1862, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> just as they were. In March,1863, Garc&iacute;a Moreno tendered his resignation to the National Assembly, who insisted upon his remaining in office until the expiration of his term. Nevertheless he had to face, during the next two years, repeated seditions and filibustering raids. After sparing the lives of the leaders in one of these movements, though they had by all law and custom incurred the penalty of death, he was severely criticized for ordering the execution of another such when it had become evident that an example was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the peace of the republic. In a naval battle at Jambel&iacute; (27 June, 1865) at which Garc&iacute;a Moreno was personally present, the defeat of the Urbina forces was complete, and tranquillity reigned until the presidential term expired on the 27th of the following August.

<p>In the following year began what may be considered as a connected series of attempts which terminated, nine years later, in the assassination of Garc&iacute;a Moreno. The dispute between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> over the Chinchas Islands had led to a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in which, following Garc&iacute;a Moreno's advice, his successor Jeronimo Carri&oacute;n had cast in the lot of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> with that of the sister republic and its then ally, <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. The ex-president was sent as minister plenipotentiary to <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, with a commission to transact business with President Prado of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> on his way. On his arrival at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> an attempt was made to assassinate him, but it ended in the death of his assailant. His diplomatic mission resulted excellently for the friendly relations between <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> and its neighbours; the sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13460a.htm">Santiago</a> also inspired Garc&iacute;a Moreno with a high admiration for <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, and he even made up his mind to attempt a change of the <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuadorean</a> constitution so as to make it more like that of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, a project which he carried into effect in the National Convention of 1869. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> he found himself a second time in the uncongenial position of leader of a revolution. To anticipate a plot which the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, led by one of Urbina's relations, were known to be forming, the conservatives of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> had risen, declared Carri&oacute;n deposed, and made Garc&iacute;a Moreno head of the provisional government. The <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the grounds on which this extreme action was taken was established by the attempt of Veintemilla, at <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, only two months later, in March, 1869.

<p>Having been duly confirmed as president <em>ad interim</em> by the National Convention of May, 1869, Garc&iacute;a Moreno resumed his work for the enlightenment, as well as the religious well-being, of his people. It was in these last years of his life that he did so much for the teaching of physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by introducing there the German Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the capital benefited vastly by his intelligent and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts. In September, 1870, the troops of Victor Emmanuel occupied <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and on 18 January, 1871, Garc&iacute;a Moreno, alone of all the rulers of the world, addressed a protest to the King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on the spoliation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> marked his appreciation of this outburst of loyalty by conferring on the President of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> the decoration of the First Class of the Order of Pius IX, with a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of commendation dated, 27 March, 1871. It was, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> that certain lodges had formally decreed the death of Garc&iacute;a Moreno, who, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, used about this time the following almost prophetic words: "What riches for me, Most Holy Father, to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> for my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for our Divine Redeemer! What <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> if your benediction should obtain for me from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> the grace of shedding my blood for Him, who being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was willing to shed His blood for us upon the Cross!" The object of numberless plots against his life, Garc&iacute;a Moreno pursued his way with unruffled confidence in the future &#151; his own and his country's. "The enemies of God and the Church can kill me", he once said, "but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not die" (Dios no muere).

<p>He had been re-elected president, and would soon have entered upon another term of office, when, towards the end of July, 1875, the police of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> were apprised that a party of assassins had begun to dog Garc&iacute;a Moreno's footsteps. When, however, the chief of police warned the intended victim, the latter so discouraged all attempts to hedge him about with precautions, as to almost excuse the carelessness of his official guardians. It came out in evidence that within the fortnight preceding the finally successful attempt, the same assassins had at least twice been foiled by the president's failing to appear on occasions when he had been expected. Finally, on the evening of 6 August, the assassins found their prey unprotected, leaving the house of some very dear friends; they followed him until he had reached the Treasury, and there Faustino Rayo, the leader of the band, suddenly attacked him with a machete, inflicting six or seven wounds, while the other three assisted in the work with their revolvers. On hearing of the death of Garc&iacute;a Moreno, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> ordered a solemn Mass of Requiem to be celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Trastevere. The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> erected to his memory, in the Collegio Pio-Latino, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a monument on which Garc&iacute;a Moreno is designated: <blockquote> Religionis integerrimus custos <br>Auctor studiorum optimorum <br>Obsequentissimus in Petri sedem <br>Justitiae cultor; scelerum vindex. </blockquote>
