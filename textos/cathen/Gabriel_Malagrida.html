<h1>Gabriel Malagrida</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, b. 18 September or 6 December, 1689, at Menaggio, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; d. 21 September, 1761, at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit order</a> at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1711. He set out from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1721 and arrived on the Island of Maranh&agrave;o towards the end of the same year. Thence he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, where for twenty-eight years he underwent numerous hardships in the Christianization of the natives. In 1749 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where he was received with great honours by the aged King John V. In 1751 he returned to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, but was recalled to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1753 upon the request of the queen dowager, Marianna of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, mother of Joseph, who had succeeded to the throne upon the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, John V.

<p>The great influence which he exerted at the Court of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was a thorn in the side of <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, the prime minister. By intrigues and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> he induced the young king, Joseph I, to banish Malagrida to Setubal (November, 1756) and to remove all the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from the Court. An attempt upon the life of the royal chamberlain, Teixeira, during which the king was accidentally wounded, was amplified by <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a> into a conspiracy headed by Malagrida and other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, Malagrida was declared guilty of high treason, but, being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he could not be executed without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. Meanwhile the officials of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, who were friendly towards Malagrida, were replaced by tools of <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, who condemned him as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and visionary, whereupon he was strangled at an <em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em>, and his body burnt. The accusation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is based on two visionary treatises which he is said to have written while in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. His authorship of these treatises has never been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and they contain such ridiculous statements that, if he wrote them, he must previously have lost his reason in the horrors of his two and a half years' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. That he was not guilty of any conspiracy against the king is admitted even by the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. A monument in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was erected in 1887 in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church of Menaggio.
