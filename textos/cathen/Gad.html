<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Gad</h1>  

<p>(<img alt="Image" src="../images/06331b01.gif" height=16>, fortune, luck).

<p>A proper name which designates in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, (I), a patriarch; (II), a tribe of Israel; (III), a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; (IV), a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deity</a>.

<h2 id="i">Gad (patriarch)</h2>

<p>A patriarch, to wit, the seventh son of Jacob, and the first by Zelpha, Lia's handmaid. He was born to Jacob in Mesopotamia of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (Aram), like his full brother, <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a> (<a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs26">Genesis 35:26</a>). On his birth, Lia exclaimed: Happily! (<img alt="Image" src="../images/06331b02.gif" height=16>) and therefore called his name Gad (<a href="../bible/gen030.htm#vrs11">Genesis 30:11</a>). The exclamation and the name given thereupon bespeak a real relation between the name of this son of Jacob, and that of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> deity which was also called "Gad"; although the exact nature of this relation is variously estimated at the present day. The patriarch Gad begot seven sons (<a href="../bible/gen046.htm#vrs16">Genesis 46:16</a>). Nothing more is said in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> concerning him personally.

<h2 id="ii">Gad (tribe)</h2>

<p>Tribe of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on the east of Jordan, between eastern Manasses on the north, and <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> on the south. The territorial possessions of the descendants of Gad cannot be given with perfect exactness. On the west, the portion of Gad abutted on the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and ran up the Arabah or Jordan valley, in a narrow strip, from the northern end of the Dead Sea to the southern extremity of the lake of Genesareth; but on the other three sides, its boundaries cannot be described with equal <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Thus, on the east, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> assigns to Gad no distinct limit. On the north, it gives, in one place (<a href="../bible/deu003.htm#vrs16">Deuteronomy 3:16</a>), the river Jeboc as the extreme limit of that tribe, while, in two other places (<a href="../bible/jos013.htm#vrs26">Joshua 13:26, 30</a>), it treats as such the locality of Manaim (Heb. Mahanaim) which was to the north of the Jeboc. In like manner, on the south, the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> represents in <a href="../bible/jos013.htm#vrs15">Joshua 13:15 sqq.</a>, as the boundary between Gad and <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>, a straight line drawn eastwards from the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and passing exactly northward of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, a town which it ascribes to <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>; whereas, it assigns elsewhere (<a href="../bible/num032.htm#vrs34">Numbers 32:34 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs37">Joshua 21:37</a>), to <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> several towns north of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and to Gad, the very town of <a href="../cathen/07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>. From these apparently conflicting biblical data it is natural to infer that the extent of the tribe of Gad varied at different times in Hebrew history, and to consider as simply conventional the definite limits ascribed to Gad on the ordinary maps of Palestine divided among the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The following are the principal towns mentioned in <a href="../bible/jos013.htm#vrs25">Joshua 13:25 sqq.</a> and <a href="../bible/num032.htm#vrs34">Numbers 32:34-36</a>, as belonging to the descendants of Gad: Jaser, Ramoth, Masphe, Betonim, Manaim, <a href="../cathen/02532b.htm">Betharan</a>, Bethnemra, Socoth, Saphon, Jegbaa, Etroth, Sophan. During the journey through the wilderness, the tribe of Gad counted upwards of 40,000 men and marched with <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and Simeon on the south side of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Allowed by Moses to settle on the east side of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, on condition of aiding in the conquest of western Palestine, the Gadites complied with that condition, took possession of the territory which they had desired as favourable to pastoral pursuits, and formed for centuries the most important <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> tribe beyond Jordan. They were a warlike race whose valour is highly praised in the parting blessing of Moses (<a href="../bible/deu033.htm#vrs20">Deuteronomy 33:20, 21</a>) and in the prophecy of Jacob (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#vrs19">Genesis 49:19</a>), and were able to hold their own in the raids made against them, chiefly by the children of Ammon. Upon the disruption of Solomon's empire, they formed a part of the northern kingdom, and shared with varying success in the subsequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against northern <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Their name appears on the <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabite</a> stone (line 10). They were carried into captivity at the same time as the other tribes beyond Jordan by Teglathphalasar (734 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), and in the time of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremias their cities were inhabited by the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>. Their territory comprised the land of Galaad, the fertility and beauty of which are still praised by eastern travellers.

<h2 id="iii">Gad (prophet)</h2>

<p>A Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, contemporary with <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a>. He came to that prince when the latter was hiding in the cave of Odollam (<a href="../bible/1sa022.htm#vrs5">1 Samuel 22:5</a>), and was probably one of the Gadites who joined <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> there (<a href="../bible/1ch012.htm#vrs8">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). He then began under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> guidance his career of counsellor, which eventually won him the name of "the seer of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>" (<a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#vrs11">2 Samuel 24:11</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch021.htm#vrs9">1 Chronicles 21:9</a>). Gad announced to the king the divine punishment for numbering the people, and advised him to erect an altar to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on Ornan's threshing-floor (<a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#vrs11">2 Samuel 24:11 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch021.htm#vrs9">1 Chronicles 21:9 sqq.</a>). He is referred to as the author of a book narrating part of David's reign (<a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#vrs29">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>) and as having assisted that king in arranging the musical services of the House of the Lord (<a href="../bible/2ch029.htm#vrs25">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>).

<h2 id="iv">Gad (pagan god)</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> divinity explicitly mentioned in <a href="../bible/isa065.htm#vrs11">Isaiah 65:11</a>, where the Hebrew name <img alt="Image" src="../images/06331b01.gif" height=16>, "Gad", is rightly rendered "Fortune" in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. As far as is known in the present day, Gad is a word of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> origin, which, long before the passage of Isaias just referred to was written, had, from a mere appellative, become the proper name of a deity. Biblical testimony to the ancient worship of Gad in <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> is certainly found in the names of such places as Baalgad (<a href="../bible/jos011.htm#vrs17">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="../bible/jos012.htm#vrs7">12:7</a>; <a href="../bible/jos013.htm#vrs5">13:5</a>) and Maglalgad "tower of Gad" (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs37">Joshua 15:37</a>). A trace of Gad's worship in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> may perhaps be found in Lia's exclamation <img alt="Image" src="../images/06331b02.gif" height=16> "begad" on the birth of her first son when she also called "Gad" (<a href="../bible/gen030.htm#vrs11">Genesis 30:11</a>); this was admitted of old by St. Augustine (Qu&aelig;stiones in Heptateuchum, in P.L., XXXIV, col. 571), and at a much more recent date by <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Dom Calmet</a>, in his Commentary on Genesis.
