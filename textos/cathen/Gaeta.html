<h1>Gaeta</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF GAETA (CAIETANA).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a> in Campania (Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). It is the ancient Caieta, situated on the slopes of the Torre di Orlando, a promontory overlooking the Mediterranean. Gaeta was an ancient Ionian colony of the Samians according to Strabo; legend, however, derives its foundation from Caieta, the nurse of &AElig;neas or Ascanius. Among the ancients it was famous for its lovely and temperate climate. Its port was of great importance in trade and in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and was restored under <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>. Among its antiquities is the mausoleum of Lucius Munatius Plancus. As Byzantine influence declined in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the town began to grow. In the ninth century (840) the inhabitants of the neighbouring Formi&aelig; fled to Gaeta through fear of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Though under the suzerainty of Byzantium, Gaeta had then, like <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, a republican form of government under a "dux" or lord. It was a strong bulwark against <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasion, and in 847 aided <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> in the naval fight at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. Later, however, looking rather to local safety, its dux, Docibilis, entered into treaties with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. From the end of the ninth century the principality of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> claimed it, as a title for the younger son of the prince. In 1039 Gaeta, with <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, acknowledged the rule of Guaimario, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>; about forty years later with the whole duchy of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> it became part of <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard's</a> new Norman territory.

<p>In the many <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> for possession of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Gaeta, owing to its important strategic position, was attacked as often and as <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> as it was defended. In 1194 the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, allies of Henry VI in the conquest of the kingdom, took possession of the town and held it as their own. In 1228 it rebelled against <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and surrendered to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but after the peace of San Germano (1230) it was given back to the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> kingdom. In 1289 Don Jaime of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> tried to gain possession of it, but failed. In 1435 Alfonso V of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (Alfonso I of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>) besieged it, and displayed great generosity, to his own disadvantage, by succouring those unable to bear arms who had been driven out from the besieged town. After a disastrous naval battle he captured it, and gained control of the kingdom. In 1501 Gaeta was retaken by the French, who, after the defeat of Garigliano (3 Jan., 1504), abandoned it to Gonsalvo de Cordova, Ferdinand the Catholic's general. In the War of the Spanish Succession it was captured (1707) by the Austrian general Daun, after a stubborn resistance made by the Spanish viceroy. In 1806 Mass&eacute;na took it; finally it became the last refuge of Francis II of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. After an heroic defence, it capitulated 13 Feb., 1861, thus sealing the annexation of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. Cialdini, the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> general, received the title of Duke of Gaeta.

<p>This city has often been the refuge of illustrious personages: among others, of Gelasius II, who was born there: of Margaret, Queen of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1387): of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> (1410) after the capture of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>; finally, of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1848), during the Roman revolution. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contains the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Erasmus, transferred from Formi&aelig;, and is a handsome building <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the twelfth century; the campanile, in Norman style, dates from 1279. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Francis, built by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, is in very fine Gothic-Italian style, and contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> by many of the most famous <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> artists. The Chapel of the Crucifix is a curiosity. It is built on a huge mass of rock that hangs like a wedge between two adjoining walls of rock. Legend tells how the rock was thus split at the moment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour's</a> death. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> dates from 846, when Constantine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Formi&aelig;, fled thither and established his residence. The See of Formi&aelig;, abandoned since the end of the sixth century, was thereafter united to that of Minturno (Minturn&aelig;). In 1818 Pius VII joined to Gaeta the very ancient See of Fondi. It was once a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, then directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> raised it to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank, without suffragans. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of note were: Francesco Patrizio (1460), friend of Pius II, author of a work in nine books, "De Regno et De Institutione Regis", dedicated to Alfonso, Duke of Calabria; and Tommaso de Vio, better known as the famous <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>. The Archdiocese of Gaeta has now 42 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 83,600 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for men, 9 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 2 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly papers.
