<h1>Gaetano Moroni</h1>  

<p>The author of the well-known "Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica", b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 17 October, 1802; d. there, 3 November, 1883. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian School</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Apprenticed later to a barber, his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> frequently took him to the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Gregorio on the Coelian Hill; there the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Mauro Cappellari, and several of the fathers recognized his exceptional <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, and made use of him in a quasi-secretarial capacity. When Cappellari became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he made Moroni his <em>cameriere</em>: and when he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, he took Moroni for <em>primo aiutante di camera</em>, employing him also as private secretary, in which capacity Moroni wrote over 100,000 letters. Moroni also served <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> as <em>aiutante di camera</em>. Among the books of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> as well as from conversation with learned people, Moroni acquired a vast store of information. He also gradually collected a considerable private <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> bearing on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions, while he made notes from daily papers and from other publications for his own instruction. The subsequent arrangement of these notes in order suggested to him the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of turning his labours to the benefit of the public, an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which he realized in the "Dizionario" (Venice, 1840-61; index, 1878-9), a mine of interesting data and authoritative in matters concerning the Pontifical Court, the organization of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. In matters of history, it depends on the writers whom its author consulted. It is, however, not a well-ordered or homogeneous work, but these defects may be readily forgiven in view of the fact that its author did his work alone, without real collaboration, and wrote at times sixteen hours a day. He was also the author of official articles on <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, the journeys of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, etc. During the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> of 1829 and 1831, he wrote the "Giornale storico-politico-eremoniale delle sede vacante e il conclave per l'elezione di Pio VIII e Gregorio XVI", which, like others of his writings remained unpublished. As a member of the household of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> Moroni was the object of much sectarian <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. He was a friend of many <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, including <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, and of other illustrious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. In the index of the "Dizionario" (s.v., Moroni), he indicates the various passages of the work which he speaks of himself, and which thus constitute a kind of autobiography.
