<h1>Galeazzo Alessi</h1>  

<p>A famous Italian architect, b. 1500; d. 1572. He showed an inclination for mathematics and literature at a very early age, and afterwards studied drawing for civil and military architecture, under the direction of Giambattista Caporali, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Perugian architect and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he became a friend of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michael Angelo</a>. He completed the fortress of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, begun by <a href="../cathen/13443a.htm">Sangallo</a>, built an apartment in it for the governor of the castle, and erected a number of palaces, regarded as the finest in the city. He resided in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> a number of years, engaged in the erection of various edifices, the laying-out of streets, and the restoration of the walls of the city. On the Carignano Hill he built the church of the Madonna. He repaired, restored, and embellished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and made designs for its tribune, choir, and <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>. His abilities were most conspicuous in his design for the harbour. He erected therein large gateway, flanked by rustic columns, and adorned the sea-front with a Doric portico, ingeniously defended by balustrades. This fortress-like work protected the city from within and without and had a spacious square for the military in the interior. He also extended the mole more than 600 paces into the sea, and left a number of designs and models which have been at various times executed by the rich nobles of that city. These and similar splendid edifices have obtained for <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> the title of <em>La Superba</em> (The Proud). Alessi executed many works at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. At Bologna he erected the great gate of the Palazzo Publico. He finished the palace of the Institute according to the design of <a href="../cathen/14715a.htm">Pellegrino Tibaldi</a>, and made plans for the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of San Petronio. At <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> he built the church of San Vittore, the whimsical auditorium del Cambio, and the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of San Celso, and greatly distinguished himself by the erection of the magnificent palace of Tommaso Marini, Duke of Torre Nuova. He also designed edifices in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> sent for him to execute some buildings, which, however, are not known, and after some period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> permitted him to return to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, laden with riches and honours. He was received by his fellow-citizens with the most flattering expressions of regard, was admitted into the <em>Scuola di Commerzio</em>; and was sent to <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> on a commission involving public interest. On his return to his own country he was requested by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese to submit a design for the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the Gesu at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so expensive, that it was never executed. For the Duke della Corgna he built the stately palace of Castiglione on the Lake of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and for the Cardinal, brother of the Duke, he erected another on a hill a few miles from the city. In conjunction with Giulio Danti, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Perugian architect, he was employed in the erection of the church on the Madonna degli Angeli, near <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, built after the design of <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a>. Finally, Alessi submitted to the Spanish Court a design for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church of the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It was considered the best among plans submitted in a general competition by all the architects of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and he was requested to execute it, but age and indisposition prevented him. Alessi was learned, agreeable in conversation, and capable of negotiating the most important affairs.
