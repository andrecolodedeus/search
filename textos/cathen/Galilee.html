<h1>Galilee</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <em>Galilaia</em>).

<p>The native land of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, where He began His ministry and performed many of His works, and whence He drew His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Orginally, the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>G&acirc;l&icirc;l</em>, derived from <em>g&acirc;lal</em>, "to roll", meant a circle or district, and in its feminine and plural forms was applied indifferently to several regions in Palestine. The simple term <em>G&acirc;l&icirc;l</em> (Galilee) occurs first in <a href="../bible/jos020.htm#vrs7">Joshua 20:7</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs32">Joshua 21:32</a>; and <a href="../bible/1ch006.htm#vrs76">1 Chronicles 6:76</a>) where it denotes that portion of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a> lying to the northeast of Lake Merom, in which lay Cedes, one of the six <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">cities of refuge</a>. In <a href="../bible/1ki009.htm#vrs11">1 Kings 9:11</a>, the expression "land of Galilee" is used to designate the northern part of Palestine, that embraced the twenty cities given by Solomon to Hiram, King of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#vrs1">9:1</a>) gives to "the land of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>, and the land of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a>" the name "Galilee of the Nations" (D.V. "Galilee of the Gentiles"), undoubtedly on account of the large <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> population in that region. As early as the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> period, the limits of Galilee had extended to Samaria (<a href="../bible/1ma010.htm#vrs30">1 Maccabees 10:30</a>), without however including the plain of Jezrael and the territory of Ptolemais (<a href="../bible/1ma012.htm#vrs47">1 Maccabees 12:47, 49</a>). The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> frequently recognizes it as dividing, with the provinces of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, all of Western Palestine. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> and, more accurately, the Talmudists (cf. Neubauer, "La G&eacute;ographie du Talmud", Paris, 1868) give its boundaries at this period, as <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and Coele-Syria on the north; the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> valley on the east; Samaria, having En Gannim (modern Jennin) at its frontier, on the south; the Mediterranean and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> on the west. The territory thus described is naturally divided by a high ridge, at the eastern extremity of which was Caphar Hanan (<em>Kefr 'An&acirc;n</em>), into Upper Galilee, embracing ancient <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a> and the northern part of <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Asher</a>, and Lower Galilee, embracing ancient <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> and parts of <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Asher</a> and Issachar. Although mountain ranges extend throughout the territory, rising to a height of 4000 feet in Upper, and to 1800 feet in Lower Galilee, the land is very productive, especially in the southern division where the valleys and plains are greater, and is capable of sustaining a very large population.

<p>Josue (xix, 10-39) names 69 important <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanite</a> towns and cities, existing in the conquered territory allotted to the Hebrew tribes of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a>, <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>, <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Asher</a>, and Issachar. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (<em>Vita</em>, 45) counted 204 prosperous villages and 15 fortified cities in the Galilee of his time. Now its population is small, and for the most part scattered among miserable villages and mud hamlets. Safed, one of the four sacred cities of Palestine revered by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which has a population of about 15,000, of whom 9000 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, is the principal city in the north. <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> city (about 10,000), is the chief city in the south. The deportation of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by Theglathphalasar (Tiglath-Pileser), 734 B. C., gave an overwhelming predominance to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> elements noted in the population by Isaias. Although the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> multiplied rapidly in Galilee after the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> exile, they were oppressed by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> as late as the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> period (<a href="../bible/1ma005.htm#vrs45">1 Maccabees 5:45-54</a>), and did not prevail until the first century before Christ. As results of their long intercourse with the conquered <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, and Greek immigrants, and their separation from their brethren in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> by interlying Samaria, they spoke a dialect and had peculiarities in business, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and religious customs, that brought upon them the contempt of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Under the Roman Empire both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> flourished there, as is evidenced by the ruins of numerous <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> belonging to that period that were destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. There are also notable ruins of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> erected by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, who restored <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Palestine in the twelfth century, and were not finally overcome until 1291, when Acre in Galilee, their last stronghold, was taken by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. The territory is now a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> possession belonging to the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>. The people are divided in their religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Latin, Greek, and <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Rites, Orthodox Greeks, and Druses live side by side with <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. Near Safed there are several modern Jewish colonies.
