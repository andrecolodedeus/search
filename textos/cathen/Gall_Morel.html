<h1>Gall Morel</h1>  

<p>Poet, scholar, aesthete, and educationist, b. at St. Fiden, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, on 24 March, 1803; d. at the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> on 16 December, 1872. His <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> was Benedict, but in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> he took the name of Gall. In 1814, he entered the gymnasium at St. Gall. A <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> in 1817 influenced him deeply, and afterwards he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>. In 1820 he took the final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and after several years spent in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1826, being appointed forthwith instructor in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. From this period his life presents a picture of extraordinary activity. From 1826 to 1832 he was professor of rhetoric, and until 1835 he lectured on philosophy. In this latter year he became librarian of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and retained this office to the end of his life, while also fulfilling the offices of choral director (1835-40), prefect (1836), and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> (1848) of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, archivist of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (1839-45), counsellor of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the Canton Schwyz (1843-5), and subprior of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (1846-52).

<p>In spite of the many demands upon his time and strength, the industrious <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> exhibited a many-sided literary activity. He is best known as a poet, ten volumes of Iyric, didactic, and dramatic verse testifying to his prolific poetical talent. Endowed by nature in so many directions, it has been said that in his poems, "he shows himself now as a childlike <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, now as a good-natured humorist, now a man fully conversant with worldly affairs, and often as a keen satirist, forceful and epigrammatic in expression." Though Morel may not rank among the princes of verse, still his modest muse produced many a poem of enduring worth. But Morel also proved himself a scholar of great versatility. Under his care the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> was enriched in thirty-seven years by more than 26,000 volumes; many of these are most valuable, especially the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, which include a tenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Horace, rescued by Morel from the binding of books, and named after him "Codex Morellianus". Drawing on these literary treasures, Morel published the "Lateinische Hymnen des Mittelalters", "Offenbarungen der Schwester Mechtild von Magdeburg", and other works. Another publication was the "Regesten der Archive der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft", and he also compiled the Regesta of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>. Morel's compilations and catalogues are models of accuracy and arrangement. He was associate founder of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Society for Historical Research (1840), and wrote many valuable contributions for its "Archiv". He likewise assisted in the formation of "Verein der funf alten Orte" and was a contributor to its organ, the "Geschichts-freund".

<p>In &aelig;sthetics, Morel became an authority by painstaking study and repeated art journeys to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His conception of &aelig;sthetics was concisely expressed in the words that he considers it the prime object of &aelig;sthetics to reconstruct creation: the Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> by the understanding in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the Divinely picturesque by our fancy in art, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creation by our will in our lives. All accomplished violinist Morel critically treated music as an important branch of &aelig;sthetics. Morel's services as an educationist for nearly fifty years are easier to estimate than to describe. His energy and his quickening influence over teachers and scholars raised the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <em>Klosterschule</em> to a high rank among institutions of learning. In this connection special mention must be made of his efforts to foster <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> drama, including the publication of two volumes entitled "Jugend- und Schultheater". In the apt words of <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Bishop Greith</a> of St. Gall, "Father Gall Morel was a living vindication of the monastic and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> life against the attacks of misunderstanding and prejudice."
