<h1>Galla</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> embracing the territory of the Galla or Oromo tribes in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>. In its widest extent the vicariate lies between 34d and 44d long. E. of Greenwich, and 4d and 10d N. lat. The Oromo or Galla, doubtless slightly <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> in descent, came originally from the region of Healal, lying between the junction of the two Niles and the River Baro. Eventually, about the fifteenth century, they began to invade <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, where they soon became so powerful that they shared the power with the Negus of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. The Galla are divided into two principal branches, the Borana or Western Galla, and the Barentouma or Eastern Galla, both of them subdivided into numerous tribes. There exist among the Galla other important tribes, also genuine <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> tribes and tribes of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> origin. The vicariate dates from 4 May, 1846. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, Right Rev. Guglielmo Massaia, was the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. He was born at Piova, province of <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a>, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, 9 June, 1809, and had been a member of the aforesaid order twenty-one years when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cassia, 24 May, 1846, and sent to the Galla tribes. It was then very difficult to gain access into the interior of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>; only after five years of incessantly renewed attempts and at the cost of great hardships and many perils was he able to reach the region of Galla Assandabo, 20 November, 1852. Having evangelized the districts of Goudrou, Lagamara, Limmou, Nonna, and Guera, this valiant apostle entered, 4 Oct., 1859, the Kingdom of Kaffa, where conversions were abundant. With apostolic foresight he provided the converted tribes with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so that when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to flee, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> did not disappear.

<p>In 1868 he was at Choa, where he laboured with success until 1879, and enjoyed the confidence of King Menelik, who made him his confidential counsellor and paid him great respect. In the interval the missions of Kaffa and Guera were administered by his coadjutor Bishop Felicissimo Coccino, who died 26 February, 1878. In 1879 Negus John of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> compelled his vassal Menelik to order Bishop Massaia to return to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The venerable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who had already been banished seven times, and was now more broken by labour and sufferings than by age, handed over the government of the vicariate to his coadjutor Bishop Taurin Cahagne, since 14 Feb., 1875, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Adramittium. Bishop Massaia was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 10 Nov., 1884; he died 6 Aug., 1889. He left valuable memoirs (see below), the publication of which was rewarded by the Italian government with the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to a high civil order, not accepted, however, by the venerable missionary. The mission of Harar was founded by Bishop Taurin, who from 1880 to 1899 sustained a glorious combat in this hot-bed of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> and opened the way to the present quite prosperous mission. He has written a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and valuable works of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> instruction in the Galla language. His name is held in veneration throughout these regions. The vicariate now includes the three great districts of Choa, Kaffa and Harar. There are 15 principal stations and an equal number of secondary ones. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> number more than 18,000. The mission possesses a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. It maintains 3 principal and 12 secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 3 dispensaries, 1 leper-hospital, 1 printing house, and important agricultural works. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> has under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> 125 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> missionaries from the province of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. There are also 8 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 10 catechists, 35 seminarists, 17 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters (Calais), and 12 Freres Gabrielistes (B. Louis-Marie Grignon de Montfort).
