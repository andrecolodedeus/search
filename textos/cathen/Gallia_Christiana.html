<h1>Gallia Christiana</h1>  

<p>A documentary catalogue or list, with brief historical notices, of all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from the earliest times, also of their occupants. In 1621 Jean Chenu, an <em>avocat</em> at the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, published in a book entitled "Archiepiscoporum et episcoporum Galli&aelig; chronologica historia". Nearly a third of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are missing, and the episcopal succession as given by Chenu was very incomplete. In 1626, Claude Robert, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, published with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, a "Gallia Christiana", in which he even entered a large number of churches outside of Gaul, and gave a short history of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. Two brothers de Sainte-Marthe, Sc&eacute;vole (1571-1650) and Louis (1571-1656), appointed royal historiographers of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1620, had assisted Chenu and Robert. At the assembly of Clergy in 1626 a number of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> commissioned these brothers to compile a more definitive work. They died before the completion of their work, and it was issued in 1656 by the sons of Sc&eacute;vole de Sainte-Marthe, Pierre (1618-90), himself historiographer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Abel (1620-71), <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and later general of the Oratory, and Nicolas-Charles (1623-62), <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Claunay. On 13 September, 1656, the Sainte-Marthe brothers were presented to the assembly of the French Clergy, who accepted the dedication of the work on condition that a passage suspected of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> be suppressed. The work formed four volumes in folio, the first for the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>, the second and third for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and the fourth for the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, all in alphabetical order. The title was "Gallia Christiana, qua series omnia archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et abbatum Franci&aelig; vicinarumque ditionum ab origine ecclesiarum ad nostra tempora per quattor tomos deducitur, et probator ex antiqu&aelig; fidei manuscriptis Vaticani, regnum, principum tabulariis omnium Galli&aelig; cathedralium et abbatarium". Such as it was, the work possessed considerable value at the time, especially for the fullness of its lists and for the reproduction of a large number of valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The defects and omissions, however, were obvious. The Sainte-Marthe brothers themselves announced in their preface the early appearance of a second edition corrected and enlarged. As early as 1660 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Jean Colomb published at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> the "Noctes Blancalandan&aelig;" which contains certain additions to the work of the Samarthani, as the brothers and their successors are often called.

<p>The edition promised by the Sainte-Marthe brothers did not appear. In 1710 the Assembly of the French Clergy offered four thousand livres to Denys de Sainte-Marthe (1650-1725), a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of Saint-Maur, renown for his polemics against the Abb&eacute; de Ranc&eacute; on the subject of monastic studies, on condition that he should bring the revision of the "Gallia Christiana" to a successful conclusion, that the first volume should appear at the end of four years, and that his congregation should continue the undertaking after his death. in 1715 through his efforts the first volume appeared, devoted to the ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>, <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, Arles, <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>. In 1720 he produced the second volume dealing with the provinces of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and in 1725 the third, which treated of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and Embrum. After his death the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> issued the fourth volume (1728) on Lyons, and the fifth volume (1731) on <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Between 1731 and 1740, on account of the controversies over the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, Dom F&eacute;lix Hodin and Dom Ettiene Brice, who were preparing the latter volumes of the "Gallia Christiana", were expelled from the Abbey of Saint-Germaine des Pr&eacute;s. They returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1739 and issued the sixth volume, dealing with Narbonne, also (1744) the seventh and eighth volumes on <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. P&egrave;re Duplessis united his efforts with theirs, and the ninth and tenth volumes, both on the province of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, appeared in 1751. The eleventh volume (1759) dealing with the province of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> was issued by P&egrave;re Pierre Henri and Dom Jacques Taschereau. In 1770 the twelfth volume on the provinces of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> and Tartenaise appeared, and in 1785 the thirteenth on the provinces of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. At the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a>, four volumes were lacking, <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, Bean&ccedil;on, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, and Vienne, respectively, and according to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> method, the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth volumes of the "Gallia Christiana". The province of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> alone has no place in this great collection, but this defect has been remedied in part by the "Bullarium Trajectense", edited by Gisbert Brom, and extending from the earliest times to 1378 (The Hague, 1891-96). The new "Gallia Christiana", of which volumes I to V and XI to XIII were reprinted by Dom Piolin between 1870 and 1877, and volumes VI to IX and XII by the publisher H. Welter, places after each <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, and after each see the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> belonging to it. The documents, instead of encumbering the body of the articles, are inserted at the foot of each column under the title "Instrumenta". This colossal work does great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and to the Sainte-Marthe <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. "The name of Sainte-Marthe", wrote Voltaire, "is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud. "

<p>In 1774 the Abb&eacute; Hugues du Temps, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, undertook in seven volumes an abridgement of the "Gallia" under the title "Le clerg&eacute;de France" of which only four volumes appeared. About 1867 the Abb&eacute; Fisquet undertook the publication of an episcopal history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (La <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Pontificate) in which for the early period he should utilize the "Gallia", at the same time bringing the history of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> down to modern times. Twenty-two volumes appeared and then the work ceased. Some years ago Canon Alban&egrave;s projected a complete revision of the "Gallia Christiana", each <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> to form a volume. Alban&egrave;s, who was one of the first scholars to search the Lateran and Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, in his efforts to determine the initial years of some episcopal reigns, found occasionally either the acts of election or the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of provision. He hoped in this way to remove certain suppositious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been introduced to fill gaps in the catalogues, but died in 1897 before the first volume appeared. Through the use of his notes and the efforts of Canon Chevalier three addition volumes of this "Gallia Christiana (novissima)", treating Arles, <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, have appeared at Montb&eacute;liard since 1899.
