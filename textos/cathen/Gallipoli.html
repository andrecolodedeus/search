<h1>Gallipoli</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF GALLIPOLI (GALLIPOLITANA).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a> (Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The city is built on a high rock in the Gulf of Tarentum and joined to the mainland by a bridge of twelve arches. It is surrounded by a bastioned wall and dominated by a castle; has also an important trade in wine, oil and fish. Drinking-water is brought to the town from the mainland by means of an aqueduct. The harbour is a natural one, and not particularly safe. It is thought that the place owes its origin to the inhabitants of Gallipolis in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. In 450, it was laid waste by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>; in the days of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604) Gallipolis belonged to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. During the Norman invasion it resisted stubbornly. Roger I gave it to his brother Bohemund, who had been made Prince of <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Tarentum</a>; thenceforth the city shared the lot of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

<p>Charles of Anjou besieged it in 1284 and destroyed it, driving the inhabitants from their homes; in 1327 Robert the Good gave them permission to return, within a short time the town again became prosperous. In 1429, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> disembarked there. In 1484, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, in order to force King Ferdinand to withdraw his troops from the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">pontifical states</a>, blockaded the port with a fleet of 60 vessels. Despite the death of their leader, Giacomo Morello, they overcame the stubborn resistance of the citizens, and sacked the town ruthlessly. It was quickly restored; but in 1496, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, in revenge for the assistance given to Ferdinand II by the town, took possession of Gallipoli; even the French blockade in 1501 did not succeed in driving them out. In 1509 Gallipoli was given back to the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, at that time under Spanish rule. A very remarkable feat of arms occurred in 1528 when 600 Gallipolitans routed an army of 4000 French infantry and 300 cavalry. The last blockade occurred in 1809 when the English attacked the place and were repulsed.

<p>Among its famous citizens are: the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> (Giovanni Andrea Coppola, Giovanni Domenica Catalano, <a href="../cathen/13031b.htm">Giuseppe Ribera (Spagnuoletto)</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Vespasiano Genuino; the poets Giovanni Coppola, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Muro, and Onofrio Orlandini; the jurisconsults Tommaso Briganti (1762) and Filippo Briganti (1804); the physician and naturalist Giovanni Presta (1797). The earliest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> we know of is one Benedict who lived in the days of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, which was introduced probably in the tenth century, remained in use until the year 1513. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, present at the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a> (787); Alessio Calcedonio (1493), one of <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion's</a> disciples; Alfonso Herrera (1576), a generous and charitable man; Vincenzo Capece (1595), a man of remarkable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; Antonio Perez de la Lastra (1679), <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; Oronzio Filomarino (1701), a renowned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built in 1629, has a famous <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>; it is the work of Francesco Bischetini, and Scipione Lachibari. The frescoes of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> (<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a>) and on the walls are the work of Carlo Malinconico. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>; it has 3 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 20,100 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling hospital</a>.
