<h1>Galveston</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF GALVESTON (GALVESTONIENSIS).

<p>The Diocese of Galveston was established in 1847 and comprises that part of the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">State of Texas</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> between the Sabine River on the east, the Colorado River on the west, the Gulf of Mexico on the south, and the northern line of the counties of Lampasas, Coryell, McLennan, Limestone, Freestone, Anderson, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, and Shelby on the north, an area of 43,000 square miles.

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> Recollects with La Salle attempted in 1685 to found the first missions among the Indians in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, and they were followed by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from Mexico sent in 1689 to build a barrier to French occupation. These efforts met with reverses, but early in the eighteenth century the missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> re-established many of the old missions and extended them in numerous new directions. They remained in a flourishing state until 1812 when they were suppressed by the Spanish Government. The colonization of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and the declaration of its independence as a republic in 1836 checked any further efforts to open the missions for several years, and then the Rev. John Timon, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Rev. John M. Odin</a>, two <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> from the community in <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, visited the state and aroused the long-neglected religious sentiments of the people. Measures were taken for the promotion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigration and the public officials of the new republic gave every encouragement to their work. In 1841 <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Father Odin</a> was named Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, but refused the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> was then made a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> and <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Father Odin</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04008a.htm">Claudiopolis</a>, 6 March, 1842. There were then only four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Bishop Odin</a> set to work vigorously to build up his charge. The <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texan</a> Congress returned several of the ancient churches to their original uses, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were opened, and the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, were introduced to care for them. In 1847 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> erected the state into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> with Galveston as its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> and <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Bishop Odin</a> was transferred to its charge. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> he secured the services of communities of the Sisters of the Incarnate Word, the Brothers of Mary, and the Oblates, to the latter of whom he gave charge, in November, 1854, of the College of the Immaculate Conception. He visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> twice to secure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and material help for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On the death of Archbishop Blanc of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Bishop Odin</a> was promoted, 15 Feb., 1861, to be his successor. During his incumbency of the See of Galveston he increased the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to forty-two and the churches to fifty, and left the diocese with a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, four academies for girls and five <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys. He was born at Ambierle, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 25 Feb., 1801, and died there, 25 May, 1870.

<p>Claude Mary Dubuis, C.S.C., an indefatigable missionary, who had served long and unselfishly for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, was his successor. He was born 10 March, 1817, at Coutouvre, Loire, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>,, 1 June, 1844, where he was also <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 23 November, 1862. After years of hardships in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> he resigned, 12 July, 1881, but kept the title <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Galveston, and retired to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Here he lived at Vernaison in the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Diocese of Lyons</a>, receiving in 1894 promotion to the titular <a href="../cathen/01687d.htm">Archbishopric of Arca</a>. He assisted the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in episcopal work until his death, which took place, 22 May, 1895. Peter Dufal, C.S.C., had been named coadjutor to Bishop Dubuis with the right of succession on 14 May, 1878. He was then <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Eastern Bengal and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04696a.htm">Delcus</a>, having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 25 November, 1860. He was born 8 Nov., 1822, at Lamure, Puy-de-Dome, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Diocese of Blois</a>, 8 Sept., 1852. On translation to Galveston he retained his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>; he resigned the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> diocese on account of ill health, 18 April, 1880, and retired to the house of his <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a> at Neuilly, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died in 1889. Nicholas Aloysius Gallagher, fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was appointed administrator of Galveston in the absence of Bishop Dufal, having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Galveston, 30 April, 1882, titular of <a href="../cathen/03297b.htm">Canopus</a>. In 1894 he succeeded to the title of Galveston. He also acted as administrator of <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus, Ohio</a>, on the death of <a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">Bishop Rosecrans</a> in 1878. Born 19 Feb., 1846, at Temperanceville, Belmont County, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 25 December, 1868, at <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus, Ohio</a>.
