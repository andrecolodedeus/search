<h1>Gambling</h1>  

<p><em>Gambling</em>, or <em>gaming</em>, is the staking of money or other thing of value on the issue of a game of chance. It thus belongs to the class of aleatory contracts which the gain or loss of the parties depends on an uncertain event. It is not gambling, in the strict sense, if a bet is laid on the issue of a game of skill like billiards or football. The issue must depend on chance, as in dice, or partly on chance, partly on skill, as in whist. Moreover, in ordinary parlance, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who plays for small stakes to give zest to the game is not said to gamble; gambling connotes playing for high stakes.

<p>In its moral aspect, although gambling usually has a bad meaning, yet we may apply to it what was said about <a href="../cathen/02539a.htm">betting</a>. On certain conditions, and apart from excess or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, it is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to stake money on the issue of a game of chance any more than it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> to insure one's <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> against risk, or deal in futures on the produce market. As I may make a free gift of my own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to another if I choose, so I may agree with another to hand over to him a sum of money if the issue of a game of cards is other than I expect, while he agrees to do the same in my favour in the contrary event.

<p>Theologians commonly require four conditions so that gaming may not be illicit.

<ul> <li>What is staked must belong to the gambler and must be at his free disposal. It is wrong, therefore, for the lawyer to stake the money of his client, or for anyone to gamble with what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the maintenance of his wife and children. <li>The gambler must act freely, without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> compulsion. <li>There must be no <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> in the transaction, although the usual ruses of the game may be allowed. It is unlawful, accordingly, to mark the cards, but it is permissible to conceal carefully from an opponent the number of trump cards one holds. <li>Finally, there must be some sort of equality between the parties to make the contract equitable; it would be unfair for a combination of two expert whist players to take the money of a couple of mere <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> at the game.</ul>

<p>If any of these conditions be wanting, gambling becomes more or less wrong; and, besides, there is generally an element of danger in it which is quite sufficient to account for the bad name which it has. In most people gambling arouses keen excitement, and quickly develops into a passion which is difficult to control. If indulged in to excess it leads to loss of time, and usually of money; to an idle and useless life spent in the midst of bad company and unwholesome surroundings; and to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> which is a source of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and ruin to others. It panders to the craving for excitement and in many countries it has become so prevalent that it rivals drunkenness in its destructive effects on the lives of the people. It is obvious that the moral aspect of the question is not essentially different if for a game of chance is substituted a horse-race, a football or cricket match, or the price of stock or produce at some future date. Although the issue in these cases seldom depends upon chance, still the moral aspect of betting upon it is the same in so far as the issue is unknown or uncertain to the parties who make the contract. Time bargains, difference transactions, options, and other speculative dealings on the exchanges, which are so common nowadays, add to the malice of gambling special evils of their own. They lead to the disturbance of the natural prices of commodities and securities, do grave injury to producers and consumers of those commodities, and are frequently attended by such unlawful methods of influencing prices as the dissemination of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reports, cornering, and the fierce contests of "bulls" and "bears", i.e. of the dealers who wish respectively to raise or lower prices.

<p>Hitherto we have prescinded from positive law in our treatment of the question of gambling. It is, however, a matter on which both the civil and the canon law have much to say. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the subject lies outside the province of the Federal Government, but many of the Sates make gambling a penal offence when the bet is upon an election, a horse-race, or a game of chance. Betting contracts and securities given upon a bet are often made void. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the Gaming Act, 1845, voids contracts made by way of gaming and wagering; and the Gaming Act, 1892, renders null and void any promise, express or implied, to pay any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> any sum of money under, or in respect of, any contract or agreement rendered null and void by the Gaming Act, 1845, or to pay any sum of money by way of commission, fee, reward, or otherwise, in respect of any such contract or agreement, or of any services in relation thereto or in connection therewith.

<p>From very early times gambling was forbidden by canon law. Two of the oldest (41, 42) among the so-called canons of the Apostles forbade games of chance under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> alike. The 79th canon of the Council of Elvira (306) decreed that one of the faithful who had been guilty of gambling might be, on amendment, restored to communion after the lapse of a year. A <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> (the famous "De Aleatoribus") long ascribed by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, but by modern scholars variously attributed to Popes Victor I, <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Callistus I</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Melchiades</a>, and which undoubtedly is a very early and interesting monument of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, is a vigorous denunciation of gambling. The <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215), by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> subsequently inserted in the "Corpus Juris", forbade <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to play or to be present at games of chance. Some authorities, such as Aubespine, have attempted to explain the severity of the ancient canons against gambling by supposing that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was often connected with it in practice. The pieces that were played with were small-sized idols, or images of the gods, which were invoked by the players for good luck. However, as <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> remarks, this can hardly be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as in that case the penalties would have been still more severe.

<p>Profane writers of antiquity are almost as severe in their condemnation of gambling as are the councils of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. Tacitus and Ammianus Marcellinus tell us that by gambling men are led into <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, cheating, lying, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, theft, and other enormities; while Peter of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> says that dice is the mother of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, theft, and sacrilege. The old canonists and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> remark that although the canons generally mention only dice by name, yet under this appellation must be understood all games of chance; and even those that require skill, if they are played for money.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> contented itself with ordering all the ancient canons on the subject to be observed, and in general prescribed that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were to abstain from unlawful games. As <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> remarks, it was left to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to decide what games should be held to be unlawful according to the different circumstances of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, place, and time. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, in the first Synod of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, put the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> into execution, and drew up a list of games which were forbidden to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and another list of those that were allowed. Among those which he forbade were not only dicing in various forms, but also games something like our croquet and football. Other particular councils declared that playing at dice and cards was unbecoming and forbidden to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and in general they forbade all games which were unbecoming to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state. Thus, a council held at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> in 1583 decreed that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were to abstain altogether from playing in public or in private at dice, cards, or any other forbidden and unbecoming game. The council held at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> in 1585 forbade them to play at cards, dice or any other game of the like kind, and even to look on at the playing of such games. Another, held at Narbonne in 1609, decreed that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were not to play at dice, cards, or other unlawful and unbecoming games, especially in public.

<p>There was some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether chess was to be considered an unbecoming, and therefore, an unlawful, game for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. In the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> it was certainly unlawful. On one occasion he caught the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> playing chess, to while away the time when on a journey. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> tried to defend himself by saying that chess was not dice. The saint, however, refused to admit the distinction, especially as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was playing in public. Scripture, he said, does not make express mention of chess, but it is comprised under the term <em>dice</em>. And <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> defends the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Some sciolist, he remarks, may say that <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> was under a delusion in classing chess under dice, since chess is not a game of chance but calls for the exercise of much skill and talent. Let that be as it may, he proceeds, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> must at any rate be guided in their conduct by the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who declared that what is not expedient, what is not edifying, is not allowed.

<p>Modern ecclesiastical law is less exacting in this matter. The provincial Councils of Westminster are content with prescribing that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> must abstain from unlawful games. The Plenary School of Maynooth, held in 1900, says that since not a little time is occasionally lost, and idleness is fostered by playing cards, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be on his guard against such games, especially where money is staked, lest he incur the reproach of being a gambler. He is also exhorted to deter the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> by word and example from betting at horse-races, especially when the stakes are high. The <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> made a distinction between games which may not suitably be indulged in by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, even when played in private, and games like cards which may be played for the sake of innocent recreation. It repeated the prohibition of the First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are not to indulge in unlawful games, and only in moderation are to use those that are lawful, so as not to cause <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Nowadays, it is commonly held that positive ecclesiastical law only forbids games of chance, even to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, when in themselves or for some extrinsic reason, such as loss of time or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, they are forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.
