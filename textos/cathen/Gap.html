<h1>Gap</h1>  

<p>(VAPINCENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, includes the department of the Hautes-Alpes. Suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> and then united to <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was re-established in 1822 and comprises, besides the ancient Diocese of Gap, a large part of the ancient Diocese of Embrun. The name of this last <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, however, has been absorbed in the title of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>.
<h2>Diocese of Gap</h2>

<p>Ancient traditions in <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, of which at least one dates from the fourteenth century, state that the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gap was <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a>, disciple of the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. <a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">Father Victor de Buck</a> in the Acta Sanctorum (October, XI) finds nothing inadmissible in these traditions, while Canon Alban&egrave;s defends them against M. Roman. Alban&egrave;s names as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gap the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/14724a.htm">St. Tigris</a> (fourth century), then St. Remedius (394-419), whom the Abb&eacute; Duchesne makes a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Antibes and who was involved in the struggle between <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> and Bishop Proculus of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, finally St. Constantinus, about 439. According to Duchesne the first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Constantinus, present at the Council of Epaone in 517. The church of Gap had, among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, St. Aregius (or Arey, 579-610?), who established at Gap a celebrated literary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and was held in great esteem by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; also St. Arnoude (1065-1078), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Trinit&eacute; de Vend&ocirc;me, named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> to replace the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniac</a> Ripert, and who became the patron of the episcopal city.
<h2>Archdiocese of Embrun</h2>

<p>The Archdiocese of Embrun had as suffragans, <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, Antibes and Grasse, Vence, Gland&egrave;ves, Senez, and <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>. Tradition ascribes the evangelization of Embrun to <a href="../cathen/10728a.htm">Sts. Nazarius and Celsus</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Marcellinus (354-74). Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Embrun were St. Albinus (400-37); St. Palladius (first half of the sixth century); St. Eutherius (middle of the seventh century); St. James (eighth century); St. Alphonsus (eighth century); St. Marcellus (end of the eighth century), whom <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> sent to evangelize Saxony; St. Bernard (805-25), under whose episcopate <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> enriched the Diocese of Embrun; St. Benedict (beginning of the tenth century), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invaders; St. Liberalis (920-40); St.Hismide (1027-45); St. Guillaume (1120-34), founder of the celebrated Abbey of Boscodon; St. Bernard Chabert (1213-35), <a href="../cathen/07238a.htm">Henry of Segusio</a> (1250-71), known as Ostiensis, i.e. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, an orator and canonist of renown; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Raimond of M&eacute;volhon (1289-94), who defended the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> against the attacks of English <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; Bertrand of Deaux (1323-38), who as the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did much to bring about the downfall of Rienzi; Jacques Gelu (1427-32), one of the first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to recognize the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> vocation of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; Giulio de' Medici) (1510-11), later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>; Cardinal Fran&ccedil;ois de Tournon (1517-26), employed on diplomatic missions by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, and founder of the College de Tournon; <a href="../cathen/14505a.htm">Cardinal de Tencin</a> (1724-40), who in September, 1727, caused the condemnation by the Council of Embrun of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Soanen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of his suffragan See of Senez. St. Vincent Ferrer preached several missions against the Vaudois in the Diocese of Embrun. Besides the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> named the following are honored as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the present Diocese of Gap: Vincent, Orontius, and Victor, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the fourth century, the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> Veranus (sixth century), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cavaillon, and the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> St. Donatus (sixth century).

<p>The Diocese of Gap possesses two noted places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, Notre-Dame d'Embrun at Embrun, where <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> erected a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, visited by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a> and Kings Henry II and Louis XVIII. Louis XI was wont to wear in his cap a leaden image of Notre-Dame d'Embrun. The other is that of Notre-Dame du Laus, where during fifty-four years (1664-1718) the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">blessed Virgin</a>. appeared "an incalculable number of times" to a shepherdess, Venerable Benoite Rencurel. Three orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had their origin in the diocese. The Sisters of Providence, a teaching and nursing order, established in 1823 from the Sisters of Portieux (Vosges) and after 1837 an independent congregation; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of Saint Joseph</a>, founded in 1837 for teaching and nursing; the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary, founded in 1835 for teaching. The Diocese of Gap, numbering 109,510 inhabitants, had in 1906 at the cessation of the Concordat, 26 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 218 missions, and 15 curacies, paid by the state. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there were in the mountainous region which forms the present diocese more than seventy <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <em>maladreries</em>, lazarettoes, or houses of refuge, administered by two congregations of the vicinity, the Brothers of La Madeleine and the Brothers of Holy Penitence. About half of these asylums disappeared during the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the sixteenth century. The others with the exception of half a score were suppressed by royal command about 1690, and their goods given to the large <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of Gap, Embrun, and Briangon. In 1900, before the Law of Associations was enforced, there were in the Diocese of Gap five maternity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf mutes, one <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys and two for girls, seven <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, two institutions for the care of the sick in their homes, all under the direction of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.
