<h1>Garcia de Loaisa</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, b. in Talavera, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1479; d. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 21 April, 1546. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were nobles; at a very early age he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Salamanca. Its severe discipline, however, affected his delicate constitution and he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Paul in Pe&ntilde;afiel where he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> in 1495. On the completion of his studies in Alcal&aacute;, and later at St. Gregory's College, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. About the same time he was appointed regent of studies and for two terms filled the office of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> in St. Gregory's College. In 1518 he represented his province at the general chapter held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where his accomplishments, his sound judgment, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> secured for him by unanimous vote the generalship of the order in succession to <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>. After visiting the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> houses in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and other countries he returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Here he made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">King Charles V</a> who, recognizing in him a man of more than ordinary ability, chose him for his confessor and later, with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction, offered him the <a href="../cathen/11339a.htm">See of Osma</a>, for which he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1524. Subsequently he held several offices of considerable political importance. In 1530 <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and transferred him to the See of Sig&uuml;enza. The following year he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, and Commissary-General of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. G. Haine found, in the royal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at Simancas, Garcia's letters to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> written in the years 1530-32. They contain information of the greatest importance for the history of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> as well as for the religious and political history of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> during that period. They manifest, moreover, the accomplishments of the author, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in which he was held and the unlimited confidence the emperor placed in him. His writings are limited to a few pastoral letters.
