<h1>Garcilasso de la Vega (the Inca)</h1>  

<p>Historian of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, 12 April, 1539; d. at C&oacute;rdoba, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1617. The name Garcilasso is a corruption of Garcia Laso, his real name. The historian's father was the Spanish conqueror, Sebastian Garcilasso de la Vega y Vargas, who was born at <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and died at <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, 1559. The elder Garcilasso had served in Mexico under <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hern&aacute;n Cortez</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a> under Diego de Alvarado, and in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> under Francisco Pizarro. In 1548, he had been named Governor of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, where, unlike others of the conquerors, he had done much to better the condition of the natives. Earlier in life, he had married an Inca princess, the historian's mother. He died in 1559, while still Governor of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, being one of the very few Spanish conquerors of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> who did not die a violent death. The Inca mother taught her son the language of the ancient inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and suggested to him the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of writing a history of these people. For this purpose, Garcilasso travelled over the entire empire of the Incas, got as much information suitable for his purpose as he could gather from both the natives and the new colonists, and consulted the few remaining monuments of that race. Being fearful of Garcilasso's growing influence with the natives of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, Philip II ordered him to proceed to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, whither he went in 1559, shortly after the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. He served there for some time under John of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the latter's campaign against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>. About 1584, he wrote his "Historia de la Florida", describing the exploits of <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Hernando de Soto</a> in that country, and published it in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In 1600, he began the first part of his "Comentarios Reales", which is a general history of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. This first part, dealing with the early history of the Incas, he finished in 1604, and published at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1609. In 1612, he finished the second part, dealing with the conquest of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and published it at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> in 1616. As a historian of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> and its people, Garcilasso enjoyed singular advantages, for his mother, an Inca princess and her relations told him everything concerning their ancestors, omitting nothing, as they considered him one of their race. On the other hand, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who was the Governor of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, was on intimate terms with many of the conquerors, so that from them the historian heard the accounts of their deeds. Garcilasso, therefore, was in a position to get information at first hand from both the natives and their conquerors. His work is of great historic value, as it constitutes practically the only document we possess of the ancient civilization of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. The first part was translated into French by Pradelle-Beaudoin (Paris, 1633, and Amsterdam, 1737, 2 vols.), and again by Dalibard (Paris, 1744, 2vols.), into German by Bottgeer (Nordhausen, 1786). The second part was translated into French by Pradelle-Beaudoin (Paris, 1646, 1658, and 1707), and into English by Rigault (London, 1688).
