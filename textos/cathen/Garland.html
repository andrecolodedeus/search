<h1>Garland</h1>  

<p>A wreath of flowers or evergreens formerly used in connection with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a>, nuptial, and funeral rites, as well as in solemn processions. The earliest certain reference to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> garland, as worn by <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, occurs in a seventh-century description of the Alexandrine ritual, written by the patriarch Severus, who says that, after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and unction (i.e. confirmation), the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> administered <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the newly-baptized with garlands. This custom was still observed at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in eighteenth century. A similar rite has also been inferred from a passage in the Gallican liturgy (<em>baptizati et in Christo coronati</em>), but more probably this expression is merely metaphorical. The bridal crown or wreath is said to be of pre-Christian Greek origin, adopted later by the Romans. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> refers to it as a sign of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, but this prejudice was afterwards set aside, and it was in common use among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the time of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. the bride and bridegroom were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> to symbolize their victory over the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the flesh. (For the continued use of garlands at the marriage <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> during the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, see Duchesne, "Christian Worship", tr. London, 1903, 428-434.) The rite has been retained by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, silver crowns taking the place of floral wreaths.

<p>Funeral garlands were used in primitive times, in connection with the burial of virgins, and especially of virgin <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, to symbolize their victory, and by analogy they came also to be used for all <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Hence they are constantly found represented in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> or <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In later times a crown, consisting of a wooden hoop, with two half-circles crossing each other at right angles and covered with flowers and streaming ribbons, used to be carried before the bier of an unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and afterwards suspended over or near to the grave. This custom was continued in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> all through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">middle ages</a> and <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period, and it survives even now in certain remote places, especially in Devon and Cornwall. The iron hook upon which such wreaths were hung, in the seventeenth century, may still be seen in the south aisle of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> Abbey. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were wont to wear floral garlands or crowns on their heads, on the occasions of solemn processions. Stow mentions one at St. Paul's, London, when the dean and chapter "apparelled in copes and vestments, with garlands of roses on their heads, issued out at the west door" (Survey of London, ed. 1750); and in the inventories and church-wardens' accounts of many an English church, items of expenditure on similar ornaments occur. The same custom prevailed also in German, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Martene (De Ant. Eccl. Rit., III, iv) mentions an illuminated <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> belonging to a church a Melun, in which such floral garlands are pictured in a <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> procession, and the same is recorded at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, Laon, and elsewhere. According to Martene also, in certain places in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> celebrating his first Mass was similarly decked, which custom still survives in certain parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The term <em>garland</em> was also technically used to signify a crown of precious metal, often adorned with gems, made for the arrangement of natural or artificial flowers before the altar or sacred image at festival times.
