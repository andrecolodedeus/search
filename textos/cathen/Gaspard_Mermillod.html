<h1>Gaspard Mermillod</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born at Carouge, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 22 September, 1824; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 23 February, 1892. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1847, and was soon after a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in Geneva, where he established two periodicals: "L'observateur Catholique" and "Les Annales Catholiques". In 1857 he became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and at the same time <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> for the canton of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. The splendid edifice of Notre-Dame, still the principal church of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, was built by him from 1851 to 1859. The funds were subscribed from all parts of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. In 1864 he became <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, and auxiliary of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> for the canton of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, with residence at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. For seven years he pursued without hindrance his episcopal functions, and was especially active for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, founding with Marie de Sales Chappuis the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/11187a.htm">Oblates of Saint Francis de Sales</a> at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> for the protection of <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> working girls. When the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> made him independent <a href="../cathen/01143a.htm">Administrator</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, the Radical Government of the canton protested, and a long and serious conflict ensued. He was at first forbidden to exercise any episcopal functions whatever, and later was declared <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> even as regarded his functions as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> renounced unconditionally the title of the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Mermillod to be Vicar-Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. The City Council, then, caused his expulsion from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, whereupon he repaired to Ferney, in French territory, from which place he governed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as best he could. At the cessation of the religious conflict <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> made the newly elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, without, however, depriving Mermillod of his office. The Government did not, however, alter its tactics, and Mermillod could return to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> only after the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose successor he became. The conflict was, however, by no means at an end, for the canton of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> refused to recognize him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and normal relations were resumed only when Mermillod became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1890. Cardinal Mermillod was one of the great preachers of modern times. In his far-sighted policy he founded in 1885 the "Union Catholique d'&eacute;tudes sociales et &eacute;conomiques". His Lettres &agrave; un Protestant sur l'autorit&eacute; de l'&eacute;glise et le schisme" (Paris, 1860) made a great impression. Another important work was his "De la vie surnaturelle dans les ames" (Lyons, 1865; Paris, 1881). His collected works were edited by Grospellier (Paris, 1893) in three volumes.
