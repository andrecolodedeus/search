<h1>Gasparo Contarini</h1>  

<p>Venetian statesman and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born 16 October, 1483, of an ancient and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; died at Bologna, 24 August, 1542. He received his elementary training in his native city; and afterwards, from 1501 to 1509, he frequented the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, where he studied Greek, mathematics, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He was a close student and acquired the reputation of a great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. After his return to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> he became, like all the sons of patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, a member of the Great Council, and afterwards was named to a commission which administered the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of the republic. In September, 1520, he was appointed orator or ambassador to the court of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> (1519-56), with instructions to defend the alliance of his Government with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a> (1515-47), and to prevent all hostile measures of the emperor. In Worms, where he arrived in April, 1521, he heard much about <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; but, not being concerned with the matter, he refrained from all interference, and never saw <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> nor spoke to him. From Worms he went with the imperial court to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, thence to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and finally to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In August, 1525, he returned to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. A report of his experiences was presented to the Senate 16 November following. During his absence he was named "Savio di terra ferma", i.e. president of a commission charged with the affairs of the Continental possessions of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and he assumed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of this office. In 1527 he represented the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> in the Congress of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, where the Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> joined the league, formed against the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and several states of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1528 he was sent as ambassador to the court of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> (1523-34), with instructions to retain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the above-mentioned league, and to defend the action of the republic in withholding from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the cities of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and Cervia, seized during the late invasion of the Constable Bourbon. Contarini failed in both objects. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> was forced not only to surrender the aforesaid cities, but also to make peace with the emperor; it was concluded through Contarini in January, 1530, at Bologna. On 24 February following, Contarini assisted at the solemn <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in Bologna, and then returned to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he presented the usual report to the Senate on 9 March. In compensation for his services he was appointed to several high positions in the government of the republic, and ultimately became a member of the Senate.

<p>Contarini was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in 1535. He accepted the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Oct., 1535). He used his influence with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to suppress abuses in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> government and to secure virtuous men for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Contarini was the president of a commission appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1536 to submit plans for a reform of evils in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> or in other parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was largely due to him that, early in 1537, the commission could present its programme, the "Consilium de emendand&acirc; ecclesi&acirc;". He advised the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> not to abuse the great <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> placed in his hands; and encouraged his friends among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take appropriate measures for discipline and good order in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, setting an example in his own Diocese of Cividale di Belluno, to which he was appointed in October, 1536. St. Ignatius acknowledged that Contarini was largely responsible for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> (1540). At the desire of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, Contarini was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1541, and took part in the conference held at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in hope of conciliating the latter. As it gradually became evident that the differences in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> could not be bridged over, the conference was broken off; Contarini remitted the final decision of all <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In January, 1542, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at Bologna, where, after a few months, death put an end to his career. His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>, first in the church of San Petronio, then transferred to the church of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Proculo, and finally, in December, 1565, to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> dell' Orto in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>.

<p>Contarini's principal works are the following: <ul><li>(1) "Libri duo de immortalitate anim&aelig;'; <li>(2) "De officio episcopi libri duo"; <li>(3) "De magistratibus et republic&acirc; Venetorum libri V"; <li>(4) "Compendii prim&aelig; philosophi&aelig; libri VIII"; <li>(5) "De potestate Pontificis"; <li>(6) "De elementis libri V"; <li>(7) "Confutatio articulorum seu qu&aelig;stionum Lutheri"; <li>(8) "De libero arbitrio"; <li>(9) "Conciliorum magis illustrium summa"; <li>(10) "De Sacramentis christian&aelig; legis et catholic&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; libri IV"; <li>(11) "De justificatione"; <li>(12) "Cathechismus"; <li>(13) "De Pr&aelig;destinatione"; <li>(14) "Scholia in epistolas divi Pauli".</ul>

<p>In many of these writings Contarini touched upon the questions raised by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>; in stating the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> view, however, he was not always fortunate. Thus, in describing the process of justification, he attributes the result largely to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &mdash; not to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with incipient charity in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense, but to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the sense of confidence. However, he departs again from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> view by including in the preparatory stage a real breaking away from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and turning to good, a repentance and detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus also, in describing the essence or the <em>causa formalis</em> of justification, he requires not only the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> quality inherent in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by which man is constituted just, but, in addition to that, the outward imputation of the merits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, believed to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> owing to the deficiency of our nature. It would be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, nevertheless, to class Contarini among the partisans of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The above-mentioned views were taken only in part from the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; as yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had given no definite decision on these matters. Moreover, Contarini wished always to remain a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; at the Conference of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> he protested repeatedly, that he would sanction nothing contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, and he left the final decision of all matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
