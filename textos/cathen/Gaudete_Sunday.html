<h1>Gaudete Sunday</h1>  

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, so called from the first word of the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> at Mass (<em>Gaudete</em>, i.e. Rejoice). The season of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> originated as a fast of forty days in preparation for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, commencing on the day after the feast of St. Martin (12 November), whence it was often called "St. Martin's Lent"-- a name by which it was known as early as the fifth century. The introduction of the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> fast cannot be placed much earlier, because there is no evidence of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> being kept on 25 December before the end of the fourth century (Duchesne, "Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien", Paris, 1889), and the preparation for the feast could not have been of earlier date than the feast itself. In the ninth century, the duration of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> was reduced to four weeks, the first allusion to the shortened season being in a letter of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">St. Nicholas I</a> (858-867) to the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and by the twelfth century the fast had been replaced by simple abstinence. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> was the first to draw up an Office for the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> season, and the Gregorian Sacramentary is the earliest to provide Masses for the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>. In both <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> provision is made for five <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, but by the tenth century four was the usual number, though some churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> observed five as late as the thirteenth century. Notwithstanding all these modifications, however, <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> still preserved most of the characteristics of a penitential seasons which made it a kind of counterpart to <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, the middle (or third) Sunday corresponding with Laetare or Mid-Lent Sunday. On it, as on <a href="../cathen/08737c.htm">Laetare Sunday</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> and flowers, forbidden during the rest of the season, were, permitted to be used; rose-coloured vestments were allowed instead of purple (or black, as formerly); the deacon and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> reassumed the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> and tunicle at the chief Mass, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> wore rose-colour instead of purple. All these distinguishing marks have continued in use, and are the present discipline of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. Gaudete Sunday, therefore, makes a breaker like <a href="../cathen/08737c.htm">Laetare Sunday</a>, about midway through a season which is otherwise of a penitential character, and signifies the nearness of the Lord's coming. Of the "stations" kept in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the four <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, that at the Vatican basilica is assigned to Gaudete, as being the most important and imposing of the four. In both <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> continual reference is made to our Lord's second coming, and this is emphasized on the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> by the additional signs of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> permitted on that day. Gaudete Sunday is further marked by a new Invitatory, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no longer inviting the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to adore merely "The Lord who is to come", but calling upon them to worship and hail with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> "The Lord who is now nigh and close at hand". The <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> lessons from the Prophecy of Isaias describe the Lord's coming and the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> that will result from it, and the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> at <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> re-echo the prophetic promises. The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of expectation is emphasized by the constant <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluias</a>, which occur in both <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> throughout the entire season. In the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> "Gaudete in Domino semper" strikes the same note, and gives its name to the day. The Epistle again incites us to rejoicing, and bids us prepare to meet the coming Saviour with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplication and thanksgiving, whilst the Gospel, the words of St. John Baptist, warns us that the Lamb of God is even now in our midst, though we appear to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not. The spirit of the Office and Liturgy all through <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> is one of expectation and preparation for the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> feast as well as for the second coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the penitential exercises suitable to that spirit are thus on Gaudete Sunday suspended, as were, for a while in order to symbolize that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in the Promised Redemption which should never be absent from the heart of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.
