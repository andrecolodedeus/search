<h1>Gebhard (III) of Constance</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of that city and strenuous defender of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against imperial encroachments during the Investitures conflict; b. about 1040; d. 12 November, 1110. He was a son of Duke Bertold I, and a brother of Bertold II, of Zahringen. For some time he was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> at Xanten, then entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/07363a.htm">Hirschau</a> and on 22 December, 1084, as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>-legate, Otto of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, the future <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">see of Constance</a> was then occupied by the imperial anti-Bishop <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, who, though <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> in 1080, retained his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by force of arms. At an imperial <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in April, 1085, Gebhard and fourteen other German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> were deposed, and <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> was declared the lawful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. Luckily, <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> died in the beginning of 1086, and Gebhard was able to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. One of his first acts as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the reform of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Petershausen near <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, which he recruited with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Hirschau. In 1089 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, to replace the old one which had fallen into ruins in 1052.

<p>On 18 April, 1089, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> appointed him and Bishop Altmann of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, Apostolic-vicars for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Arnold, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Gall, whom Henry IV appointed anti-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> on 28 March, 1092, tried in vain to eject Gebhard from the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">See of Constance</a>. The latter had powerful friends in his brother Bertold II, Duke Welf IV, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Hirschau and Petershausen, and the citizens of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. In 1094 Gebhard held a synod of reform at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and in 1095 he attended the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. Soon, however, the influence of Henry IV began to increase in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1103 Gebhard was driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and the imperial anti-bishop, Arnold, usurped the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. With the assistance of Henry V, Gebhard regained his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1105, freed the king from the ban by order of Paschal II, and accompanied him on his journey to Saxony. Gebhard attended the Synod of Nordhausen on 27 May, 1105, the diet at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1105, was sent as imperial <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the spring of 1106, and was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a> in October of the same year. In the fresh dispute that arose between Paschal II and Henry V, Gebhard seemed to side with the emperor, but, after being severely reprimanded by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, withdrew from public life and devoted his whole attention to the welfare of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.
