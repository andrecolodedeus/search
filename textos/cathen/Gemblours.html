<h1>Gemblours</h1>  

<p>(Gembloux, Gemblacum)

<p>A suppressed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> about nine miles north-west of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> on the river Orneau in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, founded c. 945 by St. Guibert (Wibert) and dedicated to St. Peter the Apostle and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Exuperius. St. Guibert was assisted in the erection of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the selection of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by Erluin, who had resigned a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Some of Guibert's relatives impugned the legality of the monastic foundation on the plea that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built on fiscal land which had been given in fief to Guibert's ancestors and could not be alienated without imperial authority. <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> summoned Guibert and Erluin to his court, but was so favourably impressed with the manner in which they defended their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> undertaking that on 20 September, 946, he issued an imperial diploma approving the foundation of Gemblours and granting it various privileges. Guibert appointed his friend Erluin first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Gemblours, while he himself become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gorze near Metz. Twice he returned to the Gemblours; once in 954, when the Hungarians threatened to pillage the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, on which occasion he not only preserved it from injury, but also converted some Hungarians to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith; and a second time in 957, when his brother-in-law Heribrand of Mawolt had seized the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He persuaded Heribrand to leave the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> unmolested in the future. On 23 May, 962, St. Guibert died at Gorze and his remains were brought to Gemblours. When monastic discipline was well established at Gemblours, Erluin attempted, at the suggestion of Count Regnier of Hainaut, to reform the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09318a.htm">Lobbes</a> in 955. But on the night of 20 October, 958, three of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Lobbes, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> reform, assaulted Erluin in his cell, dragged him outside of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and inflicted on him serious bodily injuries. Erluin died at Gemblours on 10 August 986, after Pope <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Benedict VII</a> had granted his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> exemption and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> protection.

<p>During the short reign of his successor Heriward (987-990), the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> relinquished their right of exemption in favour of Bishop Notger of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, who was friendly disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Heriward was succeeded by Erluin II (990-1012), under whose weak administration monastic discipline greatly relaxed. His successor Olbert (1012-1048), a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, restored discipline, built a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church in 1022, organized a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and by encouraging sacred and profane learning gave the first impulse to the subsequent flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of Gemblours. During the period of its greatest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity Gemblours was ruled over by Mysach (1048-1071); Thietmar (1071-1092); Liethard (1092-1115), and Anselm (1115-1136). Under Thietmar flourished the famous chronicler Sigebert (1030-1112), who in a neat Latin style wrote a chronicle of the world from 381-1111, a history of the Abbots of Gemblours, and other historical works of great value. His chronicle was continued by Abbot Anselm till 1136, and his history of the Abbots of Gemblours by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a>, a disciple of Sigebert. The learned prior Gu&eacute;rin, who was a famous teacher at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Gemblours, was a contemporary of Sigebert. In 1157 and again in 1185 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was destroyed by fire, and though rebuilt, it began from this period to decline in importance. In 1505, under Abbot Arnold II of Solbrecg (1501-1511), it became affiliated with the Bursfeld Union (see Bursfeld, Abbey of). It was pillaged by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> in 1598, and was partly destroyed by fire in 1678 and again in 1712. It was just beginning to recover from these heavy misfortunes when in 1793 the Government suppressed it. The buildings are now used for a state agricultural college.
