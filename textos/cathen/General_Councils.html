<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>Councils are legally convened assemblies of ecclesiastical dignitaries and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> experts for the purpose of discussing and regulating matters of church <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and discipline. The terms <em>council</em> and <em>synod</em> are synonymous, although in the oldest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature the ordinary meetings for worship are also called <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> are not properly councils because they are only convened for deliberation. Councils unlawfully assembled are termed <em>conciliabula</em>, <em>conventicula</em>, and even <em>latrocinia</em>, i.e. "robber <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>". The constituent elements of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council are the following: <ul> <li>A legally convened meeting <li>of members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, <li>for the purpose of carrying out their judicial and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> functions, <li>by means of deliberation in common <li>resulting in regulations and decrees invested with the authority of the whole assembly. </ul> All these elements result from an analysis of the fact that councils are a concentration of the ruling powers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for decisive action.

<p>The first condition is that such concentration conform to the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: it must be started by the head of the forces that are to move and to act, e.g. by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> if the action is limited to one province. The actors themselves are necessarily the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in their double capacity of judges and teachers, for the proper object of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> activity is the settling of questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline. When they assemble for other purposes, either at regular times or in extraordinary circumstances, in order to deliberate on current questions of administration or on concerted action in emergencies, their meetings are not called councils but simply meetings, or assemblies, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Deliberation, with free discussion and ventilation of private views, is another essential note in the notion of councils. They are the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in action, the <em>sensus ecclesiae</em> taking form and shape in the mould of <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">dogmatic definition</a> and authoritative decrees. The contrast of conflicting opinions, their actual clash necessarily precedes the final triumph of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Lastly, in a council's decisions we see the highest expression of authority of which its members are capable within the sphere of their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, with the added strength and weight resulting from the combined action of the whole body.
<h2 id="section2">Classification</h2>

<p>Councils are, then, from their nature, a common effort of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for self-preservation and self-defence. They appear at her very origin, in the time of the Apostles at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and throughout her whole history whenever <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> or discipline are seriously threatened. Although their object is always the same, the circumstances under which they meet impart to them a great variety, which renders a classification <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Taking territorial extension for a basis, seven kinds of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> are distinguished. <ol> <li><em>Ecumenical Councils</em> are those to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and others entitled to vote, are convoked from the whole world (<em>oikoumene</em>) under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, and the decrees of which, having received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, bind all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A council, Ecumenical in its convocation, may fail to secure the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the whole Church or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and thus not rank in authority with Ecumenical councils. Such was the case with the Robber Synod of 449 (<em>Latrocinium Ephesinum</em>), the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in 1409, and in part with the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Basle</a>. <li>The second rank is held by the <em>general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the East or of the West</em>, composed of but one-half of the episcopate. The <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Synod Of Constantinople (381)</a> was originally only an Eastern general synod, at which were present the four <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the East (viz. of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>), with many <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It ranks as Ecumenical because its decrees were ultimately received in the West also. <li><em>Patriarchal, national, and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> councils</em> represent a whole <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, a whole nation, or the several provinces subject to a <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>. Of such councils we have frequent examples in <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Latin Africa</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and ordinary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> used to meet under the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Carthage, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, under the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Toledo, and in earlier times in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, under the Metropolitan &#151; later Patriarch &#151; of Antioch. <li><em>Provincial councils</em> bring together the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> and other dignitaries entitled to participate. <li><em>Diocesan <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a></em> consist of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and are presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. <li>A peculiar kind of council used to be held at Constantinople, it consisted of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from any part of the world who happened to be at the time in that imperial city. Hence the name <em>synodoi enoemousai</em> "visitors' <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>". <li>Lastly there have been <em>mixed <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a></em>, in which both civil and ecclesiastical dignitaries met to settle secular as well as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. They were frequent at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> even abbesses were occasionally present at such mixed councils. Sometimes, not always, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> voted in separate chambers. </ol>



<p>Although it is in the nature of councils to represent either the whole or part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> organism yet we find many councils simply consisting of a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> brought together from different countries for some special purpose, regardless of any territorial or hierarchical connection. They were most frequent in the fourth century, when the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and patriarchal circumscriptions were still imperfect, and questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline manifold. Not a few of them, summoned by emperors or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in opposition to the lawful authorities (such as that of Antioch in 341), were positively irregular, and acted for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rather than good. Councils of this kind may be compared to the meetings of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of our own times; decrees passed in them had no binding power on any but the subjects of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present, they were important manifestations of the <em>sensus ecclesiae</em> (mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) rather than judicial or legislative bodies. But precisely as expressing the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they often acquired a far-reaching influence due, either to their internal soundness, or to the authority of their framers, or to both.

<p>It should be noted that the terms <em>concilia plenaria</em>, <em>universalia</em>, or <em>generalia</em> are, or used to be, applied indiscriminately to all <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> not confined to a single province; in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, even <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, as compared to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, received these names. Down to the late <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> to which a certain number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from different countries had been summoned were regularly styled plenary, general, or universal <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. In earlier times, before the separation of East and West, councils to which several distant <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> or exarchates sent representatives, were described absolutely as "plenary councils of the universal church". These terms are applied by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314), at which only Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present. In the same way the <a href="../cathen/04311a.htm">council of Constantinople (382)</a>, in a <a href="../fathers/3810.htm">letter to Pope Damasus</a>, calls the council held in the same town the year before (381) "an Ecumenical synod" i.e. a synod representing the <em>oikoumene</em>, the whole inhabited world as known to the Greeks and Romans, because all the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>, though no Western, took part in it. The synod of 381 could not, at that time, be termed Ecumenical in the strict sense now in use, because it still lacked the formal confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. As a matter of fact, the Greeks themselves did not put this council on a par with those of <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a> and <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Ephesus</a> until its confirmation at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Synod of Chalcedon</a>, and the Latins acknowledged its authority only in the sixth century.
<h2 id="section3">Historical sketch of ecumenical councils</h2>

<p>The present article deals chiefly with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and canonical questions concerning councils which are Ecumenical in the strict sense above defined. Special articles give the history of each important synod under the head of the city or see where it was held. In order, however, to supply the reader with a basis of fact for the discussion of principles which is to follow, a list is subjoined of the twenty Ecumenical councils with a brief statement of the purpose of each.
<h3>First Ecumenical Council: Nicaea I (325)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> lasted two months and twelve days. Three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present. <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, assisted as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of Pope Sylvester. The <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> was also present. To this council we owe The Creed (<em>Symbolum</em>) of Nicaea, defining against Arius the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (<em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>), and the fixing of the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">date for keeping Easter</a> (against the Quartodecimans).
<h3>Second Ecumenical Council: Constantinople I (381)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">First General Council of Constantinople</a>, under Pope Damasus and the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius I</a>, was attended by 150 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It was directed against the followers of Macedonius, who impugned the Divinity of the Holy Ghost. To the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> it added the clauses referring to the Holy Ghost (<em>qui simul adoratur</em>) and all that follows to the end.
<h3>Third Ecumenical Council: Ephesus (431)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a>, of more than 200 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, presided over by <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> representing <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a>, defined the true personal unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, declared <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> the Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>theotokos</em>) against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, and renewed the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>.
<h3>Fourth Ecumenical Council: Chalcedon (451)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> &#151; 150 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> under <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo the Great</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09644a.htm">Emperor Marcian</a> &#151; defined the two natures (Divine and human) in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> against <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.
<h3>Fifth Ecumenical Council: Constantinople II (553)</h3>

<p>The Second General Council of Constantinople, of 165 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> under <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> and Emperor Justinian I, condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and certain writings (<a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">The Three Chapters</a>) of Theodoret, of Theodore, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10555a.htm">Mopsuestia</a> and of Ibas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; it further confirmed the first four general councils, especially that of Chalcedon whose authority was contested by some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.
<h3>Sixth Ecumenical Council: Constantinople III (680-681)</h3>

<p>The Third General Council of Constantinople, under Pope Agatho and the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Pogonatus, was attended by the Patriarchs of Constantinople and of Antioch, 174 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the emperor. It put an end to <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> by defining two wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Divine and the human, as two distinct principles of operation. It <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul, Macarius, and all their followers.
<h3>Seventh Ecumenical Council: Nicaea II (787)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a> was convoked by Emperor Constantine VI and his mother Irene, under <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a>, and was presided over by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of Pope Adrian; it regulated the veneration of <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a>. Between 300 and 367 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted.
<h3>Eighth Ecumenical Council: Constantinople IV (869)</h3>

<p>The Fourth General Council of Constantinople, under <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Pope Adrian II</a> and Emperor Basil numbering 102 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, and 4 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, consigned to the flames the Acts of an irregular council (<em>conciliabulum</em>) brought together by Photius against <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas</a> and <a href="../cathen/07647a.htm">Ignatius</a> the legitimate <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople; it condemned Photius who had unlawfully seized the patriarchal dignity. The Photian Schism, however, triumphed in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and no other general council took place in the East.
<h3>Ninth Ecumenical Council: Lateran I (1123)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09016b.htm">First Lateran Council</a>, the first held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, met under Pope <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>. About 900 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> assisted. It abolished the right claimed by lay princes, of investiture with ring and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> and dealt with church discipline and the recovery of the Holy Land from the infidels.
<h3>Tenth Ecumenical Council: Lateran II (1139)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09017a.htm">Second Lateran Council</a> was held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a>, with an attendance of about 1000 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and the Emperor Conrad. Its object was to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>.
<h3>Eleventh Ecumenical Council: Lateran III (1179)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a> took place under <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>, <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> being emperor. There were 302 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present. It condemned the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> and <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> and issued numerous decrees for the reformation of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>.
<h3>Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV (1215)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> was held under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. There were present the Patriarchs of Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 71 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 412 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and 800 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. It issued an enlarged creed (symbol) against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> (Firmiter credimus), condemned the Trinitarian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Abbot Joachim, and published 70 important reformatory decrees. This is the most important council of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and it marks the culminating point of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power.
<h3>Thirteenth Ecumenical Council: Lyons I (1245)</h3>

<p>The First General Council of Lyons was presided over by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>; the Patriarchs of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Aquileia (Venice), 140 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Baldwin II, Emperor of the East, and St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, assisted. It <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> and directed a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, under the command of St. Louis, against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and Mongols.
<h3>Fourteenth Ecumenical Council: Lyons II (1274)</h3>

<p>The Second General Council of Lyons was held by <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a>, the Patriarchs of Antioch and Constantinople, 15 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 500 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and more than 1000 other dignitaries. It effected a temporary reunion of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The word <em>filioque</em> was added to the symbol of Constantinople and means were sought for recovering Palestine from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. It also laid down the rules for papal elections.
<h3>Fifteenth Ecumenical Council: Vienne (1311-1313)</h3>

<p>The Council of Vienne was held in that town in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by order of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, the first of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The Patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria, 300 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (114 according to some authorities), and 3 kings &#151; <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Edward II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and James II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> &#151; were present. The synod dealt with the crimes and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> imputed to the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>, the Fraticelli, the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a>, with projects of a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the teaching of Oriental languages in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>.
<h3>Sixteenth Ecumenical Council: Constance (1414-1418)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> was held during the great Schism of the West, with the object of ending the divisions in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It became legitimate only when <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> had formally convoked it. Owing to this circumstance it succeeded in putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by the election of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1403) had failed to accomplish on account of its illegality. The rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the former decrees of the synod against <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>. This council is thus ecumenical only in its last sessions (XLII-XLV inclusive) and with respect to the decrees of earlier sessions approved by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>.
<h3>Seventeenth Ecumenical Council: Basle/Ferrara/Florence (1431-1439)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a> met first in that town, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> being <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Sigismund Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Its object was the religious pacification of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Quarrels with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> having arisen, the council was transferred first to <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (1438), then to Florence (1439), where a short-lived union with the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> was effected, the Greeks accepting the council's definition of controverted points. The Council of Basle is only ecumenical till the end of the twenty-fifth session, and of its decrees <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> approved only such as dealt with the extirpation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the peace of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and which at the same time did not derogate from the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. (See also the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>.)
<h3>Eighteenth Ecumenical Council: Lateran V (1512-1517)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> sat from 1512 to 1517 under Popes <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, the emperor being Maximilian I. Fifteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and about eighty <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took part in it. Its decrees are chiefly disciplinary. A new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> was also planned, but came to naught, owing to the religious upheaval in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> caused by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>.
<h3>Nineteenth Ecumenical Council: Trent (1545-1563)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> lasted eighteen years (1545-1563) under five <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>: <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>, Marcellus II, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and under the Emperors <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and Ferdinand. There were present 5 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 33 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 235 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, 7 generals of monastic orders, and 160 <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of divinity. It was convoked to examine and condemn the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and to reform the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>. Of all councils it lasted longest, issued the largest number of dogmatic and reformatory decrees, and produced the most beneficial results.
<h3>Twentieth Ecumenical Council: Vatican I (1869-1870)</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> was summoned by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. It met 8 December, 1869, and lasted till 18 July, 1870, when it was adjourned; it is still (1908) unfinished. There were present 6 archbishop-princes, 49 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 680 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 28 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, 29 generals of orders, in all 803. Besides important canons relating to the Faith and the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the council decreed the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a> when speaking <em>ex cathedra</em>, i.e. when as shepherd and teacher of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, he defines a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> to be held by the whole Church.
<h2 id="section4">The pope and general councils</h2>

<p>The relations between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and general councils must be exactly defined to arrive at a just conception of the functions of councils in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and of their authority. The traditional phrase, "the council represents the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", associated with the modern notion of representative assemblies, is apt to lead to a serious misconception of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> function in general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. The nation's deputies receive their power from their electors and are bound to protect and promote their electors' interests; in the modern democratic State they are directly created by, and out of, the people's own power. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in council, on the contrary, hold no power, no commission, or delegation, from the people. All their powers, orders, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and membership in the council, come to them from above &#151; directly from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, ultimately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What the episcopate in council does represent is the Divinely instituted <em>magisterium</em>, the teaching and governing power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the interests it defends are those of the <em>depositum fidei</em>, of the revealed rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, i.e. the interests of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The council is, then, the assessor of the supreme teacher and judge sitting on the Chair of Peter by Divine appointment; its operation is essentially co-operation &#151; the common action of the members with their head &#151; and therefore necessarily rises or falls in value, according to the measure of its connection with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A council in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is not representative of the whole Church, for it neither represents the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who opposes it, nor the absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who cannot act beyond the limits of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> except through the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A council not only acting independently of the <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">Vicar of Christ</a>, but sitting in judgment over him, is unthinkable in the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; in fact, such assemblies have only taken place in times of great constitutional disturbances, when either there was no <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was indistinguishable from <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>. In such abnormal times the safety of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> becomes the supreme law, and the first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the abandoned flock is to find a new shepherd, under whose direction the existing evils may be remedied.

<p>In normal times, when according to the Divine constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> rules in the fullness of his power, the function of councils is to support and strengthen his rule on occasions of extraordinary difficulties arising from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, relaxed discipline, or external foes. General councils have no part in the ordinary normal government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This principle is confirmed by the fact that during nineteen centuries of Church life only twenty Ecumenical councils took place. It is further illustrated by the complete failure of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> issued in the thirty-ninth session of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (then without a rightful head) to the effect that general councils should meet frequently and at regular intervals, the very first synod summoned at Pavia for the year 1423 could not be held for want of responses to the summons. It is thus evident that general councils are not qualified to issue independently of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, dogmatic or disciplinary canons binding on the whole Church. As a matter of fact, the older councils, especially those of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451), were not convened to decide on questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> still open, but to give additional weight to, and secure the execution of, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions previously issued and regarded as fully authoritative. The other consequence of the same principle is that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in council assembled are not commissioned, as are our modern parliaments, to control and limit the power of the sovereign, or head of the State, although circumstances may arise in which it would be, their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> firmly to expostulate with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on certain of his acts or measures. The severe strictures of the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> on Pope Honorius I may be cited as a case in point.
<h2 id="section5">Composition of general councils</h2>
<h3 id="A">Right of participation</h3>

<p>The right to be present and to act at general councils belongs in the first place and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> actually exercising the episcopal office. In the earlier councils there appear also the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a> (country-bishops), who, according to the better opinion, were neither <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nor an order interposed between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> invested with a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> smaller than the episcopal but larger than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a>. They were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and charged with the administration of a certain district in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. They had the power of conferring <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>. Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not ruling a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, had equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> with other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (1869-70), where 117 of them were present. Their claim lies in the fact that their order, the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, entitles them, <em>jure divino</em>, to take part in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that a general council seems to afford a proper sphere for the exercise of a right which the want of a proper diocese keeps in abeyance. Dignitaries who hold episcopal or quasi-episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> without being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; such as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> nullius, mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of whole orders or congregations of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, generals of clerks regular, <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a> and monastic orders &#151; were allowed to vote at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Their title is based on positive canon law: at the early councils such votes were not admitted, but from the seventh century down to the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the contrary practice gradually prevailed, and has since become an acquired right. Priests and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> frequently cast decisive votes in the name of absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom they represented; at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, however, such procurators were admitted only with great limitations, and at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> they were even excluded from the council hall. Besides voting members, every council admits, as consultors a number of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and canon law. In the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> the consultors were allowed to vote. Other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> have always been admitted as notaries. Lay people may be, and have been, present at councils for various reasons, but never as voters. They gave advice, made complaints, assented to decisions, and occasionally also signed the decrees. Since the Roman emperors had accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, they assisted either personally or through deputies (<em>commissarii</em>). <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> was present in person at the First General Council, Theodosius II sent his representatives to the third, and Emperor Marcian sent his to the fourth, at the sixth session of which himself and the Empress Pulcheria assisted personally. Constantine Pogonatus was present at the sixth, the Empress Irene and her son Constantine Porphyrogenitus only sent their representative to the seventh, whereas Emperor Basil, the Macedonian, assisted at the eighth, sometimes in person, sometimes through his deputies. Only the Second and the Fifth General Synods were held in the absence of the emperors or imperial commissaries, but both <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> and Justinian were at Constantinople while the councils were sitting, and kept up constant intercourse with them. In the West the attendance of kings, even at <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, was of frequent occurrence. The motive and object of the royal presence were to protect the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, to heighten their authority, to lay before them the needs of particular <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> states and countries.

<p>This laudable and legitimate co-operation led by degrees to interference with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> matters. The Eastern Emperor Michael claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to summon councils without obtaining the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent, and to take part in them personally or by proxy. But <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> resisted the pretensions of Emperor Michael, pointing out to him, in a letter (865), that his imperial predecessors had only been present at general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> dealing with matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and from that fact drew the conclusion that all other <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> should be held without the emperor's or his commissaries' presence. A few years later the Eighth General Synod (Can. xvii, Hefele, IV, 421) declared it <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that no synod could be held without the emperor's presence the emperors had only been present at general councils &#151; and that it was not right for secular princes to witness the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (at <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>). As early as the fourth century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> greatly complained of the action of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> in imposing his commissary on the Synod of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (335). In the West, however, secular princes were present even at <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a>, e.g. Sisenand, King of the Spanish <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, was at the Fourth Council of Toledo (636) and King Chintilian at the fifth (638); <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> assisted at the <a href="../cathen/06236a.htm">Council of Frankfort</a> (794) and two Anglo Saxon kings at the <a href="../cathen/15610a.htm">Synod of Whitby</a> (<em>Collatio Pharenes</em>) in 664. But step by step <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> established the principle that no royal commissary may be present at any council except a general one, in which "faith, reformation, and peace" are in question.
<h3 id="B">Requisite number of members</h3>

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present required to constitute an Ecumenical council cannot be strictly defined, nor need it be so deigned, for ecumenicity chiefly depends on co-operation with the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and only secondarily on the number of co-operators. It is physically impossible to bring together all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world, nor is there any standard by which to determine even an approximate number, or proportion, of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to secure ecumenicity. All should be invited, no one should be debarred, a somewhat considerable number of representatives of the several provinces and countries should be actually present; this may be laid down as a practicable theory. But the ancient Church did not conform to this theory. As a rule only the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> received a direct summons to appear with a certain number of their suffragans. At Ephesus and Chalcedon the time between the convocation and the meeting of the council was too short to allow of the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being invited. As a rule, but very few Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were personally present at any of the first eight general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Occasionally, e.g. at the sixth, their absence was remedied by sending deputies with precise instructions arrived at in a previous council held in the West. What gives those Eastern <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> their Ecumenical character is the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as head of the universal, and, especially, of the Western, Church. This circumstance, so remarkably prominent in the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, affords the best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that, in the sense of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the essential constituent element of ecumenicity is less the proportion of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> absent than the organic connection of the council with the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h3 id="C">Papal headship the formal element of councils</h3>

<p>It is the action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that makes the councils ecumenical. That action is the exercise of his office of supreme teacher and ruler of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its necessity results from the fact that no authority is commensurate with the whole Church except that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; he alone can bind all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Its sufficiency is equally manifest: when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has spoken ex cathedra to make his own the decisions of any council, regardless of the number of its members nothing further can be wanted to make them binding on the whole Church. The earliest enunciation of the principle is found in the letter of the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (313) to <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Pope Julius I</a>, and was often quoted, since the beginning of the fifth century, as the (Nicaean) canon concerning the necessity of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> co-operation in all the more important conciliary Acts. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> historian <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26012.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.17</a>) makes Pope Julius say, in reference to the Council of Antioch (341), that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>kanon</em>) forbids "the churches to pass <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> contrary to the judgement of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>" and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (III, x) likewise declares "it to be a holy law not to attribute any value to things done without the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>". The letter of Julius here quoted by both <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> directly refers to an existing <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> custom and, in particular, to a single important case (the deposition of a patriarch), but the underlying principle is as stated.

<p>Papal co-operation may be of several degrees: to be effective in stamping a council as universal it must amount to taking over responsibility for its decisions by giving them formal confirmation. The Synod of Constantinople (381) in which the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> received its present form &#151; the one used at Mass &#151; had in itself no claim to be Ecumenical. Before Pope Damasus and the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had seen its full Acts they condemned certain of its proceedings at an Italian synod, but on receiving the Acts, Damasus, so we are told by Photius, confirmed them. Photius, however, is only right with regard to the Creed, or <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Symbol of Faith</a>: the canons of this council were still rejected by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> and even by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (about 600). A <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Creed of Constantinople enjoyed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction may be drawn from the way in which the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> at the Fourth General Synod (Chalcedon, 451) allowed, without any protest, appeals to this Creed, while at the same time they energetically protested against the canons of the council. It was on account of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Creed that, in the sixth century, Popes Vigilius, <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> declared this council Ecumenical, although <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> still refused to sanction its canons. The First Synod of Constantinople presents, then, an instance of a minimum of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> co-operation impressing on a particular council the mark of universality. The normal co-operation, however, requires on the part of the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> more than a <em>post-factum</em> acknowledgment.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> office and the council's function in the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> require that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should call the council together, preside over and direct its labours, and finally <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> its decrees to the universal Church as expressing the mind of the whole teaching body guided by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Instances of such normal, natural, perfect co-operation occur in the five Lateran councils, which were presided over by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in person; the personal presence of the highest authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his direction of the deliberations, and <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the decrees, stamp the conciliary proceedings throughout as the function of the <em>Magisterium Ecclesiae</em> in its most authoritative form. Councils in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is represented by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> are, indeed, also representative of the whole teaching body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the representation is not absolute or adequate, is no real concentration of its whole authority. They act in the name, but not with the whole power, of the teaching Church, and their decrees become universally binding only through an act, either antecedent or consequent, of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The difference between councils presided over personally and by proxy is marked in the form in which their decrees are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has been present the decrees are published in his own name with the additional formula: <em>sacro approbante Concilio</em>; when <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> have presided the decrees are attributed to the synod (<em>S. Synodus declarat, definit, decernit</em>)
<h2 id="section6">Factors in the pope's co-operation with the council</h2>

<p>We have seen that no council is Ecumenical unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has made it his own by co-operation, which admits of a minimum and a maximum consequently of various degrees of perfection. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers could have saved themselves much trouble if they had always based their <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> on the simple and evident principle of a sufficient minimum of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> co- operation, instead of endeavouring to prove, at all costs, that a maximum is both required in principle and demonstrable in history. The three factors constituting the solidarity of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and council are the convocation, direction, and confirmation of the council by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>- but it is not essential that each and all of these factors should always be present in full perfection.
<h3 id="A">Convocation</h3>

<p>The juridical convocation of a council implies something more than an invitation addressed to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world to meet in council, viz.: the act by which in law the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are bound to take part in the council, and the council itself is constituted a legitimate tribunal for dealing with Church affairs. <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">Logically</a>, and in the nature of the thing, the right of convocation belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone. Yet the convocation, in the loose sense of invitation to meet, of the first eight general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, was regularly issued by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors, whose dominion was coextensive with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or at least with the Eastern part of it, which was then alone convened. The imperial letters of convocation to the Councils of Ephesus (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> I, 1343) and of Chalcedon (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> II, 42) show that the emperors acted as protectors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> it their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to further by every means in their power the welfare of their charge. Nor is it possible in every case to prove that they acted at the formal instigation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; it even seems that the emperors more than once followed none but their own initiative for convening the council and fixing its place of meeting. It is, however. evident that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors cannot have acted thus without the consent, actual or presumed of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Otherwise their conduct had been neither lawful nor wise. As a matter of fact, none of the eight Eastern Ecumenical <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, with the exception, perhaps, of the fifth, was summoned by the emperor in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. As regards the fifth, the conduct of the emperor caused the legality of the council to be questioned &#151; a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> required the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent for the lawfulness of councils. As regards most of these eight <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, particularly that of Ephesus, the previous consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, actual or presumed, is manifest. Regarding the convocation of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, the Emperor Marcian did not quite fall in with the wishes of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> as to the time and place of its meeting, but he did not claim an absolute right to have his will, nor did the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> acknowledge such a right. On the contrary, as <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> explains in his letters (Epp. lxxxix, xc, ed. <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>), he only submitted to the imperial arrangements because he was unwilling to interfere with Marcian's well-meant endeavours.

<p>It is still more evident that convocation by the emperors did not imply on their part the claim to constitute the council juridically, that is, to give it power to sit as an authorized tribunal for Church affairs. Such a claim has never been put forward. The expressions <em>jubere</em> and <em>keleuein</em>, occasionally used in the wording of the convocation, do not necessarily convey the notion of strict orders not to be resisted; they also have the meaning of exhorting, inducing, bidding. The juridical constitution of the council could only emanate, and in fact always did emanate, from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. As the necessity of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> meeting in council was dictated rather by the distressful condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than by positive orders, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> contented himself with authorizing the council and this he effected by sending his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to preside over and direct the work of the assembled <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The Emperor Marcian in his first letter to <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> declares that the success of the intended synod depends on his &#151; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> &#151; authorization, and Leo, not Marcian, is later called the <em>auctor synodi</em> without any restrictive qualification, especially at the time of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a> dispute, where the extension of the synod's authority was called in question. The law therefore, at that period was the same as it is now as far as essentials are concerned: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the sole convener of the council as an authoritative juridical assembly. The difference lies in the circumstance that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> left to the emperor the execution of the convocation and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> measures for rendering the meeting possible and surrounding it with the <em>&eacute;clat</em> due to its dignity in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The material, or business, part of the councils being thus entirely in the hands of the emperors, it was to be expected that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was sometimes induced &#151; if not forced &#151; by circumstances to make his authorization suit the imperial wishes and arrangements.

<p>After studying the principles it is well to see how they worked out in fact. Hence the following historical summary of the convocation of the first eight general councils:

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Vita Constantini, III, vi) informs us that the writs of convocation to the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">First General Synod</a> were issued by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>, but as not one of those writs has come down to us, it remains <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether or not they mentioned any previous consultation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is, however, an undeniable fact that the Sixth General Synod (680) plainly affirmed that the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> had been convened by the emperor and Pope Sylvester (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., XI, 661). The same statement appears in the life of Sylvester found in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, but this evidence need not be pressed, the evidence from the council being, from the circumstances in which it was given, of sufficient strength to carry the point. For the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> took place in Constantinople, at a time when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the imperial city already attempted to rival the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the vast majority of its members were Greeks; their statement is therefore entirely free from the suspicion of Western <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> or prejudice and must be accepted as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> presentment of fact. Rufinus, in his continuation of Eusebius' history (I, 1) says that the emperor summoned the synod <em>ex sacerdotum sententia</em> (on the advice of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>)- it is but fair to suppose that if he consulted several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> he did not omit to consult with the head of all.

<p>(2) The Second General Synod (381) was not, at first, intended to be Ecumenical; it only became so because it was accepted in the West, as has been shown above. It was not summoned by Pope Damasus as is often contended, for the assertion that the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> professed to have met in consequence of a letter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> is based on a confusion. The document here brought in as evidence refers to the synod of the following year which was indeed summoned at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, but was not an Ecumenical synod.

<p>(3) The Third General Council (Ephesus, 431) was convoked by Emperor Theodosius II and his Western colleague Valentinian III- this is evident from the Acts of the council. It is equally evident that <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a> gave his consent, for he wrote (15 May, 431) to Theodosius that he could not appear in person at the synod, but that he would send his representatives. And in his epistle of 8 May to the synod itself, he insists on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present to hold fast to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, expects them to accede to the sentence he has already pronounced on Nestorius, and adds that he has sent his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to execute that sentence at Ephesus. The members of the council acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> directions and orders, not only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> consent, in the wording of their solemn condemnation of Nestorius: "Urged by the Canons and conforming to the Letter of our most holy Father and fellow servant Celestine the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, we have framed this sorrowful sentence against Nestorius." They express the same sentiment where they say that "the epistle of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (to Cyril, communicated to the council) already contains a judgment and a rule <em>psepho kai typou</em> on the case of Nestorius" and that they &#151; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in council &#151; have executed that ruling. All this manifests the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> conviction that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the moving and quickening spirit of the synod.

<p>(4) How the Fourth General Synod (Chalcedon, 451) was brought together is set forth in several writings of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> and Emperors Theodosius II and Marcian. Immediately after the Robber Synod, Leo asked Theodosius to prepare a council composed of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from all parts of the world, to meet, preferably, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He repeated the same request, first made 13 October, 449, on the following <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">feast of Christmas</a>, and prevailed on the Western <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Emperor Valentinian III</a> together with his empress and his mother, to support it at the Byzantine Court. Once more (in July, 450) Leo renewed his request, adding, however that the council might be dispensed with if all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to make a profession of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without being united in council. About this time Theodosius II died and was succeeded by his sister, <a href="../cathen/12561c.htm">St. Pulcheria</a>, and her husband Marcian. Both at once informed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of their willingness to summon the council, Marcian specially asking him to state in writing whether he could assist at the synod in person or through his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> writs of convocation might be issued to the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By that time, however, the situation had greatly improved in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>&mdash;nearly all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had taken part in the Robber Synod had now repented of their aberration and signed, in union with their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> colleagues, the "Epistola dogmatica" of Leo to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, by this act rendering the need of a council less urgent. Besides, the Huns were just then invading the West, preventing many <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose presence at the council was most desirable, from leaving their flocks to undertake the long journey to Chalcedon. Other motives induced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to postpone the synod, e.g. the fear that it might be made the occasion by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constantinople to improve their hierarchical position, a fear well justified by subsequent events. But Marcian had already summoned the synod, and Leo therefore gave his instructions as to the business to be transacted. He was then entitled to say, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been at the council that the synod had been brought together "ex praecepto christianorum principum et ex consensu apostolicae sedis" (by order of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes and with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>). The emperor himself wrote to Leo that the synod had been held by his authority (<em>te auctore</em>), and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Moesia, in a letter to the Byzantine Emperor Leo, said: "At Chalcedon many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled by order of Leo, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> head of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>".

<p>(5) The Fifth General Synod was planned by Justinian I with the consent of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a>, but on account of the emperor's dogmatic pretensions, quarrels arose and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused to be present, although repeatedly invited. His Constitutum of 14 May 553, to the effect that he could not consent to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> and Theodoret, led to open opposition between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and council. In the end all was righted by Vigilius approving the synodal decrees.

<p>(6, 7, 8) These three <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were each and all called by the emperors of the time with the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> and assistance of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.
<h3 id="B">Direction</h3>

<p>The direction or presidency of councils belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the same right as their convocation and constitution. Were a council directed in its deliberations and acts by anyone independent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and acting entirely on his own responsibility, such a council could not be the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> own in any sense: the defect could only be made good by a consequent formal act of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> accepting responsibility for its decisions. In point of fact, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> presided over all the Eastern councils, which from their beginning were legally constituted. The reader will obtain a clearer insight into this point of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> proceedings from a concrete example, taken from Hefele's introduction to his "History of the Councils":

<p><a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Pope Adrian II</a> sent his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the Eighth Ecumenical Synod (787) with an express declaration to the Emperor Basil that they were to act as presidents of the council. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, Bishop Donatus of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, Bishop Stephen of Nepesina, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Marinus of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, read the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">papal rescript</a> to the synod. Not the slightest objection was raised. Their names took precedence in all protocols; they determined the duration of the several sessions, gave leave to make speeches and to read documents and to admit other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, they put the leading questions, etc. In short, their presidency in the first five sessions cannot be disputed. But at the sixth session Emperor Basil was present with his two sons, Constantine and Leo, and, as the Acts relate, received the presidency. These same Acts, however, at once clearly distinguish the emperor and his sons from the synod when, after naming them they continue: <em>conveniente sanct&acirc; ac universali synodo</em> (the holy and universal synod now meeting), thus disassociating the lay ruler from the council proper. The names of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> continue to appear first among the members of the synod, and it is they who in those latter sessions determine the matters for discussion, subscribe the Acts before anyone else, expressly as presidents of the synod, whereas the emperor, to show clearly that he did not consider himself the president, would only subscribe after all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> begged him to put his and his son's names at the head of the list, but he stoutly refused and only consented at last, to write his name after those of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> and of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, but before those of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Pope Adrian II</a>, in a letter to the emperor, praises him for not having assisted at the council as a judge (<em>judex</em>), but merely as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and protector (<em>conscius et obsecundator</em>).

<p>The imperial commissaries present at the synod acted even less as presidents than the emperor himself. They signed the reports of the several sessions only after the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> though before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; their names are absent from the signatures of the Acts. On the other hand it may be contended that the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> <a href="../cathen/07647a.htm">Ignatius of Constantinople</a>, and the representatives of the other Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, in some degree participated in the presidency: their names are constantly associated with those of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and clearly distinguished from those of the other <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. They, as it were, form with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> a board of directors, fix with him the order of proceedings, determine who shall be heard, subscribe, like the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, before the emperor and are entered in the reports of the several sessions before the imperial commissaries. All this being granted, the fact still remains that the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> unmistakably hold the first place, for they are always named first and sign first, and &#151; a detail of great importance &#151; for the final subscription they use the formula: <em>huic sanctae et universali synodo praesidens</em> (presiding over this holy and universal synod), while <a href="../cathen/07647a.htm">Ignatius of Constantinople</a> and the representatives of the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> claim no presidency but word their subscription thus: <em>suscipiens et omnibus quae ab ea judicata et scripta sunt concordans et definiens subscripsi</em> (receiving this holy and universal synod and agreeing with all it has judged and written, and defining I have signed). If, on the one hand, this form of subscription differs from that of the president, it differs no less, on the other, from that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. These, like the emperor, have without exception used the formula: <em>suscipiens (synodum) subscripsi</em> (receiving the synod I have signed), omitting the otherwise customary definiens, which was used to mark a decisive vote (<em>votum decisivum</em>).

<p>Hefele gives similar documentary accounts of the first eight general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, showing that <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> always presided over them when occupied in their proper business of deciding questions on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline. The exclusive right of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in this matter was generally acknowledged. Thus, the Emperor Theodosius II says, in his edict addressed to the Council of Ephesus, that he had sent Count Candidian to represent him, but that this imperial commissary was to take no part in dogmatic disputes since "it was unlawful for one who is not enrolled in the lists of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to mingle in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> inquiries". The <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> acknowledged that Pope Leo, by his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, presided over it as "the head over the members". At Nicaea, <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a>, Vitus and Vincentius, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, signed before all other members of the council. The right of presiding and directing implies that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, if he chooses to make a full use of his powers, can determine the subject matter to be dealt with by the council, prescribe rules for conducting the debates, and generally order the whole business as seems best to him. Hence no <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is legitimate if carried under protest &#151; or even without the positive consent &#151; of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. The consent of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> alone, acting without a special order from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is not sufficient to make <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees at once perfect and operative; what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> own consent. For this reason no <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> can become legitimate and null in law on account of pressure brought to bear on the assembly by the presiding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> acting on his orders. Such pressure and restriction of liberty, proceeding from the internal, natural principle of order through the use of lawful power, does not amount to external, unnatural coercion, and, therefore, does not invalidate the Acts due to its exercise.

<p>Examples of councils working at high pressure, if the expression may be used, without spoiling their output, are of frequent occurrence. Most of the early councils were convened to execute decisions already finally fixed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, no choice being left the assembled Fathers to arrive at another decision. They were forced to conform their judgment to that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with or without discussion. Should <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pressure go beyond the limits of the council's dignity and of the importance of the matters under discussion the effect would be, not the invalidation of the council's decrees, but the paralysing of its moral influence and practical usefulness. On the other hand, the fact that a synod is, or has been, acting under the leadership of its Divinely appointed head, is the best guarantee of its freedom from unnatural disturbances, such as intrigues from below or coercion from above. In the same way violent interference with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> leadership is the grossest attack on the council's natural freedom. Thus the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Synod of Ephesus</a> (449), though intended to be general and at first duly authorized by the presence of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, was declared invalid and null by those same <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> at Chalcedon 451), because the prejudiced Emperor Theodosius II had removed the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and entrusted the direction of the council to <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a>.
<h3 id="C">Confirmation</h3>

<p>Confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees is the third factor in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> co-operation with the council. The council does not represent the teaching Church till the visible head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has given his approval, for, unapproved, it is but a headless, soulless, impersonal body, unable to give its decisions the binding force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the whole Church, or the finality of judicial sentences With the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval, on the contrary, the council's pronouncements represent the fullest effort of the teaching and ruling Church, a <em>judicium plenissimum</em> beyond which no power can go. Confirmation being the final touch of perfection, the seal of authority, and the very life of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that it should be a personal act of the highest authority, for the highest authority cannot be delegated. So much for the principle, or the question of right. When we look for its practical working throughout the history of councils, we find great diversity in the way it has been applied under the influence of varying circumstances. <ol> <li>Councils over which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presides in person require no further formal confirmation on his part, for their decisions formally include his own as the body includes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> of 1869-70 offers an example in point. <li>Councils over which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presides through his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> are not identified with himself in the same degree as the former. They constitute separate, dependent, representative tribunals, whose findings only become final through ratification by the authority for which they act. Such is the theory. In practice, however, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation is, or may be, presumed in the following cases: <ul><li>When the council is convened for the express purpose of carrying out a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision previously arrived at, as was the case with most of the early <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; or when the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> give their consent in virtue of a special public instruction emanating from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; in these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification pre-exists, is implied in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decision, and need not be formally renewed after the council. It may, however, be superadded <em>ad abundantiam</em>, as, e.g. the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consent of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> may also be presumed when, as generally at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> have personal instructions from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on each particular question coming up for decision, and act conformably, i.e. if they allow no decision to be taken unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent has previously been obtained. <li>Supposing a council actually composed of the greater part of the episcopate, concurring freely in a unanimous decision and thus bearing unexceptional witness to the mind and sense of the whole Church: The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose office it is to voice <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, would be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by the very nature of his office, to adopt the council's decision, and consequently his confirmation, ratification, or <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> could be presumed, and a formal expression of it dispensed with. But even then his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, presumed or expressed, is juridically the constituent factor of the decision's perfection. </ul> <li>The express ratification in due form is at all times, when not absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, at least desirable and useful in many respects: <ul><li>It gives the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> proceedings their natural and lawful complement, the keystone which closes and crowns the arch for strength and beauty; it brings to the front the majesty and significance of the supreme head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <li>Presumed consent can but rarely apply with the same efficacy to each and all of the decisions of an important council. A solemn <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification puts them all on the same level and removes all possible <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. <li>Lastly the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification formally <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgates</a> the sentence of the council as an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> to be known and accepted by all the faithful; it brings to light and public view the intrinsic ecumenicity of the council&mdash;it is the natural, official, indisputable criterion, or test, of the perfect legality of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> transactions or conclusions. If we bear in mind the numerous disturbing elements at work in and around an Ecumenical council, the conflicting religious, political, scientific, and personal interests contending for supremacy, or at least eager to secure some advantage, we can easily realize the necessity of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification to crush the endless chicanery which otherwise would endanger the success and efficacy of the highest tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even they who refuse to see in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation an authentic testimony and sentence, declaring <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> the ecumenicity of the council and its decrees to be a <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">dogmatic fact</a>, must admit that it is a sanative act and supplies possible defects and shortcomings; the Ecumenical authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is sufficient to impart validity and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> to the decrees he makes his own by officially ratifying them. This was done by <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> for the Fifth General Synod. Sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for the sanatory efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification lies in the absolute sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of his ex-cathedra pronouncements. Should it be argued, however, that the sentence of an Ecumenical council is the only absolute, final, and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> sentence even then, and then more than ever, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. For in the transactions of an Ecumenical council the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> plays the principal part, and if any deficiency in his action, especially in the exercise of his own special prerogatives, were apparent, the labours of the council would be in vain. The faithful hesitate to accept as <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> guides of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> documents not authenticated by the seal of the fisherman, or the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which now wields the authority of St. Peter and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/09157a.htm">Leo II</a> beautifully expresses these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in his ratification of the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a>: "Because this great and universal synod has most fully proclaimed the definition of the right <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of St. Peter the Apostle, whose office we, though unequal to it, are holding, also reverently receives: therefore we also, and through our office this <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, consent to, and confirm, by the authority of Blessed Peter, those things which have been defined, as being finally set by he Lord Himself on the solid rock which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." </ul></ol>

<p>No event in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> better illustrates the necessity and the importance of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> co-operation and, in particular, confirmation, than the controversies which in the sixth century raged about the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> were the condemnation (1) of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and his writings; (2) of Theodoret's writings against Cyril and the Council of Ephesus; (3) of a letter from Ibas to Maris the Persian, also against Cyril and the council. Theodore anticipated the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Nestorius; Ibas and Theodoret were indeed restored at <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, but only after they had given <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> explanations and shown that they were free from <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. The two points in debate were: (1) Did the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the said <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>? (2) How, i.e. by what test, is the point to be settled? Now the two contending parties agreed in the principle of the test: the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the council stands or falls with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> himself. Defenders of the Chapters, e.g. <a href="../cathen/06317a.htm">Ferrandus the Deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/05751a.htm">Facundus of Hermiane</a>, put forward as their chief argument (<em>prima et immobilis ratio</em>) the fact that Leo had approved. Their opponents never questioned the principle but denied the alleged fact, basing their denial on Leo's epistle to Maximus of Antioch in which they read: "Si quid sane ab his fratribus quos ad S. Synodum vice mea, praeter id quod ad causam fidei pertinebat gestum fuerit, nullius erit firmitatis" (If indeed anything not pertaining to the cause of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should have been settled by the brethren I sent to the Holy Synod to hold my place, it shall be of no force). The point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (<em>causa fidei</em>) referred to is the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">heresy of Eutyches</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> refer to that of Nestorius, or rather to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and writings connected with it.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the council, assembled at Constantinople in 533 for the purpose of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> controversy, addressed to <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> two Confessions, the first with the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a>, the second with his successor <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius</a>, in which, to establish their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, they profess that they firmly hold to the four general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> as approved by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Thus we read in the <em>Confessio</em> of <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a>: "But also the letters of Pope Leo of blessed memory and the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> issued in support of the Faith and of the authority (<em>firmitas</em>) of the aforesaid four <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, we promise to follow and observe in all points and we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> any man, who on any occasion or altercation should attempt to nullify our promises." And in the <em>Confessio</em> of <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius</a>: "<em>Suscipimus autem et amplectimur epistolas praesulum Romance Sedis Apostolicae, tam aliorum quam Leonis sanctae memoriae de fide scriptas et de quattuor sanctis conciliis vel de uno eorum</em>" (We receive and embrace the letters of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, those of others as well as of Leo of holy memory, concerning the Faith and the four holy <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> or any of them).
<h2 id="section7">Business methods</h2>

<p>The way in which councils transact business now demands our attention. Here as in most things, there is an ideal which is never completely realized in practice.
<h3 id="A">The facts</h3>

<p>It has been sufficiently shown in the foregoing section that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, either in person or by deputy, directed the transaction of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> business. But when we look for a fixed order or set of rules regulating the proceedings we have to come down to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> to find an official <em>Ordo concilii ecumenici</em> and a <em>Methodus servanda in prima sessione</em>, etc. In all earlier councils the management of affairs was left to the Fathers and adjusted by them to the particular objects and circumstances of the council. The so-called <em>Ordo celebrandi Concilii Tridentini</em> is a compilation posterior to the council, written by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> secretary, A. Massarelli; it is a record of what has been done not a rule of what should be done. Some fixed rules were, however, already established at the reform councils of the fifteenth century as a substitute for the absent directing power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The substance of these rulings is given in the "Caeremoniale Romanum" of Augustinus Patritius (d. 1496). The institution of "congregations" dates from the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1415). At earlier councils all the meetings of the Fathers were called indiscriminately <em>sessiones</em> or <em>actiones</em>, but since <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> the term <em>session</em> has been restricted to the solemn meetings at which the final votes are given while all meetings for the purpose of consultation or provisory voting are termed <em>congregations</em>.

<p>The distinction between general and particular congregations likewise dates from <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>, where, however, the particular congregations assumed a form different in spirit and composition from the practice of earlier and later councils. They were simply separate assemblies of the "nations" (first four, then five) present at the council; their deliberations went to form national votes which were presented in the general assembly, whose decisions conformed to a majority of such votes. The particular congregations of more recent councils were merely consultative assemblies (committees commissions) brought together by appointment or invitation in order to deliberate on special matters. At <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> there were congregations of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and congregations of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, both partly for <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, partly for discipline. The congregations of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were either "deputations", i.e. committees of specially chosen experts, or conciliary groups, usually three into which the council divided for the purpose of facilitating discussion.

<p>The official <em>ordo</em> of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> confirmed the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> practice, leaving, however, to the initiative of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> the formation of groups of a more private character. The voting by "nations", peculiar to the reform councils, has also been abandoned in favour of the traditional voting by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> (<em>capita</em>). At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> there were seven "commissions" consisting of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> from all countries, appointed a year before the actual meeting of the assembly. Their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to prepare the various matters to be laid before the council. The object of these congregations is sufficiently described by their titles: (1) Congregatio cardinalitia directrix; (2) Commissio caeremoniarum, (3) politico-ecclesiastica; (4) pro ecclesiis et missionibus Orientis; (5) pro Regularibus; (6) theologica dogmatica; (7) pro disciplina ecclesiastica (i.e. a general directive <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> congregation, and several commissions for ceremonies, politico-ecclesiastical affairs, the churches and missions of the Orient, the regular orders, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>). On the basis of their labours were worked out the <em>schemata</em> (drafts of decrees) to be discussed by the council. Within the council itself there were seven "deputations": (1) Pro recipiendis et expendendis Patrum propositionibus (appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to examine the propositions of the Fathers); (2) Judices excusationum (Judges of excuses); (3) Judices querelarum et controversiarum (to settle questions of precedence and such like); (4) deputatio pro rebus ad fidem pertinentibus (on matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>); (5) deputatio pro rebus disciplinae ecclesiasticae (on <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>); (6) pro rebus ordinum regularium (on <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders); (7) pro rebus ritus orientalis et apostolicis missionibus (Oriental rites and Apostolic missions).

<p>All these deputations, except the first, were chosen by the council. Objections and amendments to the proposed <em>schemata</em> had to be handed in in writing to the responsible deputation which considered the matter and modified the <em>schema</em> accordingly. Anyone desiring further to improve the modified draft had to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> permission to propose his amendments in a speech, after which he put them down in writing. If, however, ten <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> decided that the matter had been sufficiently debated, leave for speaking was refused. At this stage the amendments were collected and examined by the synodal congregation, then again laid before the general congregation to be voted on severally. The votes for admission or rejection were expressed by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> standing or remaining seated. Next the <em>schema</em>, reformed in accordance with these votes, was submitted to a general congregation for approval or disapproval <em>in toto</em>. In case a majority of <em>placets</em> were given for it, it was accepted in a last solemn public session, after a final vote of <em>placet</em> or <em>non placet</em> ("it pleases", or "it does not please").
<h3 id="B">The theory</h3>

<p>The principle which directs the practical working of a council is the perfect, or best possible, realization of its object, viz. a final judgment on questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, invested with the authority and majesty of the whole teaching body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To this end some means are absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, others are only desirable as adding perfection to the result. We deal first with these latter means, which may be called the ideal elements of the council: <ol> <li>The presence of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world is an ideal not to be realized, but the presence of a very great majority is desirable for many reasons. A quasi-complete council has the advantage of being a real representation of the whole Church, while a sparsely attended one is only so in law, i.e. the few members present legally represent the many absent, but only represent their juridical power, their ordinary power not being representable. Thus for every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> absent there is absent an authentic witness of the Faith as it is in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. <li>A free and exhaustive discussion of all objections. <li>An appeal to the universal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> &#151; if existing &#151; witnessed to by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in council. This, if realized, would render all further discussion superfluous. <li>Unanimity in the final vote, the result either of the universal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as testified to by the Fathers, or of conviction gained in the debates. It is evident that these four elements in the working of a council generally contribute to its ideal perfection, but it is not less evident that they are not essential to its substance, to its conciliary effectiveness. If they were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> many acknowledged councils and decrees would lose their intrinsic authority, because one or other or all of these conditions were wanting. Again, there is no standard by which to determine whether or not the number of assisting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was sufficient and the debates have been exhaustive &#151; nor do the Acts of the councils always inform us of the unanimity of the final decisions or of the way in which it was obtained. Were each and all of these four elements essential to an authoritative council no such council could have been held, in many cases, when it was none the less urgently required by the necessities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Authors who insist on the ideal perfection of councils only succeed in undermining their authority, which is, perhaps, the object they aim at. Their fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> notion of the nature of councils. They conceive of the function of the council as a witnessing to, and teaching of, the generally accepted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &#151; whereas it is essentially a juridical function, the action of judges as well as of witnesses of the Faith. This leads us to consider the essential elements in <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> action. </ol>

<p>From the notion that the council is a court of judges the following inferences may be drawn: <ol><li>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in giving their judgment, are directed only by their personal conviction of its rectitude; no previous consent of all the faithful or of the whole episcopate is required. In unity with their head they are one solid college of judges authoritatively constituted for united, decisive action &#151; a body entirely different from a body of simple witnesses. <li>This being admitted, the assembled college assumes a representation of their colleagues who were called but failed to take their seats, provided the number of those actually present is not altogether inadequate for the matter in hand. Hence their resolutions are rightly said to rest on universal consent: <em>universali consensu constituta</em>, as the formula runs. <li>Further, on the same supposition, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of judges is subject to the rule obtaining in all assemblies constituted for framing a judicial sentence or a common resolution, due regard being paid to the special relations, in the present instance, between the head and the members of the college: the co-operative verdict embodies the opinion of the majority, including the head, and in law stands for the verdict of the whole assembly, it is <em>communi sensu constitutum</em> (established by common consent). A majority verdict, even headed by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, if disconnected from the personal action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, still falls short of a perfect, authoritative pronouncement of the whole Church, and cannot claim <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. Were the verdict unanimous, it would still be imperfect and fallible, if it did not receive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. The verdict of a majority, therefore, not endorsed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, has no binding force on either the dissentient members present or the absent members, nor is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bound in any way to endorse it. Its only value is that it justifies the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in case he approves it, to say that he confirms the decision of a council, or gives his own decision <em>sacro approbante concilio</em> (with the consent of the council). This he could not say if he annulled a decision taken by a majority including his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, or if he gave a casting vote between two equal parties. A unanimous conciliary decision, as distinct from a simple majority decision, may under certain circumstances, be, in a way, binding on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and compel his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> &#151; by the compelling power, not of a superior authority, but of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shining forth in the witnessing of the whole Church. To exert such power the council's decision must be clearly and unmistakably the reflex of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all the absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. </ol>

<p>To gain an adequate conception of the council at work it should be viewed under its twofold aspect of judging and witnessing. In relation to the faithful the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> assembly is primarily a judge who pronounces a verdict conjointly with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, at the same time, acts more or less as witness in the case. Its position is similar to that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> towards the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: <em>quod accepistis a me per multos testes</em>. In relation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the council is but an assembly of authentic witnesses and competent counsellors whose influence on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sentence is that of the mass of evidence which they represent or of the preparatory judgment which they pronounce, it is the only way in which numbers of judges can influence one another. Such influence lessens neither the dignity nor the efficiency of any of the judges &#151; on the other hand it is never required, in councils or elsewhere, to make their verdict unassailable. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, not excluding the fourth session in which <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> was defined, comes nearer than any former council to the ideal perfection just described. It was composed of the greatest number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, both absolutely and in proportion to the totality of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; it allowed and exercised the right of discussion to an extent perhaps never witnessed before; it appealed to a general tradition, present and past, containing the effective principle of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> under discussion, viz. the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of submitting in obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and of conforming to its teaching; lastly it gave its final definition with absolute unanimity, and secured the greatest majority &#151; nine-tenths &#151; for its preparatory judgment.
<h2 id="section8">Infallibility of general councils</h2>

<p>All the arguments which go to prove the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> apply with their fullest force to the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> authority of general councils in union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For conciliary decisions are the ripe fruit of the total life-energy of the teaching Church actuated and directed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Such was the mind of the Apostles when, at the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs28">Acts 15:28</a>), they put the seal of supreme authority on their decisions in attributing them to the joint action of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and of themselves: <em>Visum est Spiritui sancto et nobis</em> (It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us). This formula and the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> it enshrines stand out brightly in the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and have been carefully guarded throughout the many storms raised in councils by the play of the human element. From the earliest times they who rejected the decisions of councils were themselves rejected by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> saw in the decrees of Nicaea "a Divine commandment" and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa: "What <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken through the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> endureth for ever." <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (Ep. xxi) pronounces himself ready to die by the sword rather than give up the Nicene decrees, and <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo the Great</a> expressly declares that "whoso resists the Councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon cannot be numbered among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>" (Ep. lxxviii, ad Leonem Augustum). In the same epistle he says that the decrees of Chalcedon were framed <em>instruente Spiritu Sancto</em>, i.e. under the guidance of the Holy Ghost. How the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was embodied in many professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be seen in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger's</a> (ed. Stahl) "Enchiridion symbolorum et definitionum", under the heading (index) "Concilium generale representat ecclesiam universalem, eique absolute obediendum" (General councils represent the universal Church and demand absolute obedience). The Scripture texts on which this unshaken <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is based are, among others: "But when he, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is come, he will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> . . ." <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs13">John 16:13</a>) "Behold I am with you [teaching] all days even to the consummation of the world" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs20">Matthew 28:20</a>), "The gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it [i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>]" (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>).
<h2 id="section9">Papal and conciliar infallibility</h2>

<p>Papal and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> are correlated but not identical. A council's decrees approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> are <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> by reason of that <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> also <em>extra concilium</em>, without the support of a council. The <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility proper to the pope</a> is not, however, the only formal adequate ground of the council's <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. The Divine constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the promises of Divine assistance made by her Founder, guarantee her inerrancy, in matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, independently of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">pope's infallibility</a>: a fallible <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supporting, and supported by, a council, would still pronounce <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> decisions. This accounts for the fact that, before the Vatican <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff's</a> ex-cathedra judgments, Ecumenical councils were generally held to be <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> even by those who denied the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>; it also explains the concessions largely made to the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privilege that it is not necessarily implied in the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of councils, and the claims that it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> separately and independently on its proper merits. The <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the council is intrinsic, i.e. springs from its nature. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised to be in the midst of two or three of His disciples gathered together in His name; now an Ecumenical council is, in fact or in law, a gathering of all <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> co-workers for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of man through <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and holy conduct; He is therefore in their midst, fulfilling His promises and leading them into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for which they are striving. His presence, by cementing the unity of the assembly into one body &#151; His own mystical body &#151; gives it the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> completeness, and makes up for any defect possibly arising from the physical absence of a certain number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The same presence strengthens the action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, so that, as mouthpiece of the council, he can say in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, "it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us", and consequently can, and does, put the seal of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> irrespective of his own <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">personal infallibility</a>.

<p>Some important consequences flow from these principles. Conciliar decrees approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> have a double guarantee of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>: their own and that of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallible pope</a>. The council's dignity is, therefore, not diminished, but increased, by the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, nor does that definition imply a "circular demonstration" by which the council would make the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would render the same service to the council. It should however, be borne in mind that the council without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has no guarantee of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, therefore the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibilities</a> are not two separate and addible units, but one unit with single or double excellence. An <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> statement of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> speaking through the mouth of the visible head of His mystical body or in unison, in chorus, with all its members. The united voice of the whole Church has a solemnity, impressiveness, and effectiveness, an external, circumstantial weight, which is wanting in simple ex-cathedra pronouncements. It works its way into the minds and hearts of the faithful with almost irresistible force, because in the universal harmony each individual believer hears his own voice, is carried away by the powerful rhythm, and moved as by a Divine spell to follow the leaders. Again, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have personally contributed to the definitions have, in that fact, an incentive to <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in publishing them and enforcing them in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; nay the council itself is an effective beginning of its execution or enforcement in practice. For this reason alone, the holding of most Eastern councils was a moral necessity &#151; the great distance between East and West, the difficulty of communication, the often keen opposition of the Orientals to Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> made a solemn <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the definitions on the spot more than desirable. No aids to effectiveness were to be neglected in that centre of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.

<p>These considerations further account for the great esteem in which <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> definitions have always been held in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and for the great authority they universally enjoyed without any detriment to, or diminution of, the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. From of old it has been customary to place side by side, in the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, the authority of the councils and that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as substantially the same. Thus, we read in the formula, or profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> imposed by Pope Hormisdas (514-23) on the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> implicated in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Acacius: "The first [step towards] <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is to keep the rule of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> [rectae] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in no wise to deviate from the constitutions of the Fathers [i.e. councils]. But the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to St. Peter (Thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> . . .) cannot be passed over, for what He said has been verified by the events, since in the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion has always been preserved without spot or stain. Wishing by no means to be separated from this hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and following the constitutions of the Fathers, we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Nestorius, in his time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, who was condemned in the Council of Ephesus by Blessed Celestine, Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and by Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> . . . We declare and approve all the letters of Leo, Pope, which he wrote concerning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, as we have stated before, following in all things the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and professing [<em>praedicantes</em>] all its constitutions. And therefore I hope to be worthy to be with you [the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>] in the one communion which this <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> professes, in which lies the entire, veracious, and peaceful solidity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. . . ." It should be noted that in this formula the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> is the centre from which radiates the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the councils.
<h2 id="section10">Subject matter of infallibility</h2>

<p>The subject matter of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, or supreme judicial authority, is found in the definitions and decrees of councils, and in them alone, to the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, scientific, or historical reasons upon which they are built up. These represent too much of the human element, of transient mentalities, of personal interests to claim the promise of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> made to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a whole; it is the sense of the unchanging Church that is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, not the sense of individual <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> of any age or excellence, and that sense finds expression only in the conclusions of the council approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Decisions referring to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> were called in the East <em>diatyposeis</em> (constitutions, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>); those concerned with discipline were termed <em>kanones</em> (canons, rules), often with the addition of <em>tes eutaxias</em> (of discipline, or good order). The expressions <em>thesmoi</em> and <em>horoi</em> apply to both, and the short formulae of condemnation were known as <em>anathematismoi</em> (<a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>).

<p>In the West no careful distinction of terms was observed: <em>canones</em> and <em>decreta</em> signify both dogmatic and disciplinary decisions. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> styled its disciplinary edicts <em>decreta de reformatione</em>; its dogmatic definitions <em>decreta</em>, without qualification, where they positively assert the points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> then in dispute, and <em>canones</em> when, in imitation of the ancient <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a>, they imposed an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm"><em>anathema sit</em></a> on those that refused assent to the defined propositions. An opinion too absurd to require refutation pretends that only these latter canons (with the attached <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>) contain the peremptory judgment of the council demanding unquestioned submission. Equally absurd is the opinion, sometimes recklessly advanced, that the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <em>capita</em> are no more than explanations of the <em>canones</em>, not proper definitions; the council itself, at the beginning and end of each chapter, declares them to contain the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. Thus Session XIII begins: "The Holy Synod forbids to all the faithful in future to believe, teach, or preach concerning the Holy Eucharist otherwise than is explained and defined in the present decree", and it ends: "As, however, it is not enough to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without discovering and refuting <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it has pleased the Holy Synod to subjoin the following canons, so that all, now knowing the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, may also understand what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> they have to beware against and avoid." The same remark applies to the chapters of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in its two Constitutions, as appears from the concluding words of the <em>proemium</em> of the first Constitution and from the initial phrases of most chapters. All that may be conceded is that the chapters of both councils contain the <em>doctrina catholica</em>, i.e. the authorized teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but not always and invariably <em>dogmata formalia</em>, i.e. propositions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> defined as such.
<h2 id="section11">Promulgation</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">Promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> because they are <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and no law is binding until it has been brought unmistakably to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all it intends to bind. The decrees are usually <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the name of the synod itself; in cases of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presiding in person they have also been published in the form of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees with the formula: <em>sacr&acirc; universali synodo approbante</em>.

<p>The Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Basle</a> affirmed with great emphasis that an Ecumenical council is superior in authority to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and French <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have adopted that proposition as one of the famous four Gallican Liberties. Other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> affirmed, and still affirm, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is above any general council. The leading exponents of the Gallican <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> are: Dupin (1657-1719), professor at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> ("Dissertatio de concilii generalis supra Romanum Pontificem auctoritate", in his book on the ancient <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, "De antiqu&acirc; Ecclesiae disciplin&acirc; dissertationes historicae"); and Natalis Alexander, 0.P. (1639-1724), in the ninth volume of his great "Historia Ecclesiastica" (Diss. iv ad saeculum XV). On the other side <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Lucius Ferraris</a> (Bibliotheca Canonica, s.v. Concilium) and Roncaglia, editor and corrector of Natalis Alexander's history, stoutly defend the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> superiority. Hefele, after carefully weighing the main arguments of the Gallicans (viz. that <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> approved the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a> the identical declaration of the Council of Basle, affirming the superiority of an Ecumenical synod over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>), concluded that both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in the interests of peace, approved of the councils in general terms which might imply an <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the point in question, but that neither Martin nor Eugene ever intended to acknowledge the superiority of a council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. (See Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, I, 50-54)

<p>The principles hitherto set forth supply a complete solution to the controversy. General councils represent the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> therefore stands to them in the same relation as he stands to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But that relation is one of neither superiority nor inferiority, but of intrinsic cohesion: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is neither above nor below the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but in it as the centre is in the circle, as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. By taking our stand on the Scriptural <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the mystical body of Christ of which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the visible head, we see at once that a council apart from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is but a lifeless trunk, a "rump parliament", no matter how well attended it be.
<h2 id="section13">Can a council depose the pope?</h2>

<p>This question is a legitimate one, for in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> circumstances have arisen in which several pretenders contended for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority and councils were called upon to remove certain claimants. The Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Basle</a>, and Gallican <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, hold that a council may depose a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on two main grounds: <ul> <li><em>ob mores</em> (for his conduct or behaviour, e.g. his resistance to the synod) <li><em>ob fidem</em> (on account of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or rather want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>). </ul>

<p>In point of fact, however, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is the only legitimate ground. For a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has ceased to be a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and cannot, therefore, be its head. A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, on the other hand, remains a member of the (visible) Church and is to be treated as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> ruler for whom we must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but from whom we may not withdraw our obedience.

<p>But the question assumes another aspect when a number of claimants pretend to be the rightful occupants of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and the right of each is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. In such a case the council, according to <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (Disputationes, II xix, de Conciliis) has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to examine the several claims and to depose the pretenders whose claims are unfounded. This was done at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Synod of Constance</a>. But during this process of examination the synod is not yet Ecumenical; it only becomes so the moment the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> assents to its proceedings. It is evident that this is no instance of a legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> being deposed by a legitimate council, but simply the removal of pretender by those on whom he wishes to impose will.

<p>Not even <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> could have been deposed at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a>, had his election not been <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> and himself suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, moreover, abdicated and by his abdication made his removal from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> lawful. In all controversies and complaints regarding <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the rule laid down by the Eighth General Synod should never be lost sight of: "If a universal synod be assembled and any ambiguity or controversy arise concerning the Holy Church of the Romans, the question should be examined and solved with due reverence and veneration, in a spirit of mutual helpfulness; no sentence should be audaciously pronounced against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> of the elder <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" (can. xxi. Hefele, IV, 421-22).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">SCHEEBEN wrote copiously and learnedly in defence of the Vatican Council; his article in the <em>Kirchenlexicon</em>, written in 1883, contains the marrow of his previous writings, while HEFELE'S <em>History of the Councils</em> is the standard work on the subject. For a deeper study of the councils a good collection of the <em>Acta Conciliorum</em> is indispensable. The first ever printed was the very imperfect one of MERLIN (Paris, 1523). A second and richer collection, by the Belgian Franciscan PETER CRABBE, appeared in 1538 at Cologne, in 3 vols. Completer editions were published as time went on: SURIUS (Cologne, 1567, 5. vols.); BOLANUS (Venice, 1585, 5 vols.); BINIUS (Cologne, 1606), with historical and explanatory notes from Baronius &#151; republished 1618, and in Paris, 1636, in 9 vols.; the Roman collection of general councils with Greek text, arranged by the Jesuit SIRMOND (1608 &#151; 1612), in 4 vols. &#151; each council is preceded by a short history. On Bellarmine's advice Sirmond omitted the Acts of the Synod of Basle. This Roman collection is the foundation of all that followed. First among these is the Paris <em>Collectio Regia</em>, in 37 vols. (1644). Then comes the still completer collection of the Jesuits LABBE and COSSART (Paris, 1674), in 17 folio vols., to which BALUZE added a supplementary volume (Paris, 1683 and 1707). Most French authors quote from LABBE-BALUZE. Yet another and better edition is due to the Jesuit HARDOUIN; it is of all the most perfect and serviceable. MANSI &#151; later Archbishop of Lucca, his native town &#151; with the help of many Italian scholars, brought out a new collection of 31 volumes, which, had it been finished, would have surpassed all its predecessors in merit. Unfortunately it only comes down to the fifteenth century, and, being unfinished, has no indexes. To fill this gap, WELTER, a Paris publisher, took up (1900) the new collection proposed (1870) by V . Palme. To a facsimile reprint of the 31 volumes of MANSI (Florence, Venice, 1757-1797) he added 19 supplementary volumes, furnishing the necessary indexes, etc. The <em>Acta et Decreta sacrorum conciliorum recentiorum Collectio Lacensis</em> (Freiburg im Br., 1870-90), published by the Jesuits of Maria-Laach, extends from 1682 to 1869. An English translation of HEFELE'S standard <em>History of the Christian Councils</em>, by W. R. CLARK, was commenced in 1871 (Edinburgh and London); a French translation by the Benedictines of Farnborough is also in course of publication (Paris, 1907). Among the latest authors treating of councils are WERNZ, <em>Jus Decretalium</em> (Rome, 1899), I, II; OJETTI, <em>Synopsis rerum moralium et juris canonici</em>, s.v. Concilium.</p></div>
