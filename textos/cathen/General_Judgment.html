<h1>General Judgment</h1>  

<p>(Judicium Universale, Last Judgment).
<h2 id="section1">Existence of the general judgment</h2>
<h3>1</h3>

<p>Few <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are more often or more clearly proclaimed in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> than that of the general judgment. To it the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> refer when they speak of the "Day of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#vrs31">Joel 2:31</a>; <a href="../bible/eze013.htm#vrs5">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href="../bible/isa002.htm#vrs12">Isaiah 2:12</a>), in which the nations will be summoned to judgment. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the second Parusia, or coming of Christ as Judge of the world, is an oft-repeated <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> Himself not only foretells the event but graphically portrays its circumstances (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs27">Matthew 24:27 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs31">25:31 sqq.</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> give a most prominent place to this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in their preaching (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs42">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs31">17:31</a>) and writings (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs5">Romans 2:5-16</a>; <a href="../bible/rom014.htm#vrs10">14:10</a>; <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs1">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="../bible/2th001.htm#vrs5">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#vrs7">James 5:7</a>). Besides the name Parusia (<em>parousia</em>), or <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs23">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs19">2 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), the Second Coming is also called Epiphany, <em>epiphaneia</em>, or Appearance (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs14">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs1">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="../bible/tit002.htm#vrs13">Titus 2:13</a>), and Apocalypse (<em>apokalypsis</em>), or Revelation (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#vrs13">1 Peter 4:13</a>). The time of the Second Coming is spoken of as "that Day" (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs8">2 Timothy 4:8</a>), "the day of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1th005.htm#vrs2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>), "the day of Christ" (<a href="../bible/phm001.htm#vrs6">Philemon 1:6</a>), "the day of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk017.htm#vrs30">Luke 17:30</a>), "the last day" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs39">John 6:39-40</a>).
<h3>2</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the general judgment has prevailed at all times and in all places within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is contained as an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> in all the ancient <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creeds</a>: "He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>. From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead" (<a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>). He shall come again with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to judge both the living and the dead" (<a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>). "From thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead, at whose coming all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> must rise with their bodies and are to render an account of their deeds" (<a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>). Relying on the authority of <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a>, several Fathers of the first four centuries advanced the theory of a thousand years' terrestrial reign of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to precede the end of the World (<em>see article on</em> <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">MILLENNIUM</a>). Though this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is interwoven with the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> teachings of those writers, it in no way detracted from their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a universal world-judgment. Patristic testimony to this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is clear and unanimous.
<h3>3</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> thus explains why, besides the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a> of each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, a general one should also be passed on the assembled world: "The first reason is founded on the circumstances that most augment the rewards or aggravate the punishments of the dead. Those who depart this life sometimes leave behind them children who imitate the conduct of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, descendants, followers; and others who adhere to and advocate the example, the language, the conduct of those on whom they depend, and whose example they follow; and as the good or bad influence or example, affecting as it does the conduct of many, is to terminate only with this world; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands that, in order to form a proper estimate of the good or bad actions of all, a general judgment should take place. . . . Finally, it was important to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, that in prosperity and adversity, which are sometimes the promiscuous lot of the good and of the bad, everything is ordered by an all-wise, all-just, and all-ruling Providence: it was therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> not only that rewards and punishments should await us in the next life but that they should be awarded by a public and general judgment."
<h2 id="section2">Signs that are to precede the general judgment</h2>

<p>The Scriptures mention certain events which are to take place before the final judgment. These predictions were not intended to serve as indications of the exact time of the judgment, for that day and hour are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to the Father, and will come when least expected. They were meant to foreshadow the last judgment and to keep the end of the world present to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, without, however, exciting useless curiosity and vain fears. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> usually enumerate the following nine events as signs of the last judgment:
<h3 id="A">General preaching of the Christian religion</h3>

<p>Concerning this sign the Saviour says: "And this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom</a>, shall be preached in the whole world, for a testimony to all nations, and then shall the consummation come" (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs14">Matthew 24:14</a>). This sign was understood by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> and Theophilus as referring to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but, according to the majority of interpreters, Christ is here speaking of the end of the world.
<h3 id="B">Conversion of the Jews</h3>

<p>According to the interpretation of the Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> towards the end of the world is foretold by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13156a.htm">Epistle to the Romans</a> (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs25">11:25-26</a>): "For I would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, . . . that blindness in part has happened in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should come in. And so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a> as it is written: <em>There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Jacob</a></em>".


<h3 id="C">Return of Enoch and Elijah</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that these two men, who have never tasted death, are reserved for the last times to be precursors of the Second Advent was practically unanimous among the Fathers, which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> they base on several texts of Scripture. (Concerning <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elijah</a> see <a href="../bible/mal004.htm#vrs5">Malachi 4:5-6</a>; <a href="../bible/sir048.htm#vrs10">Sirach 48:10</a>; <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs11">Matthew 17:11</a>; concerning <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> see <a href="../bible/sir044.htm#vrs16">Sirach 44:16</a>)
<h3 id="D">A great apostasy</h3>

<p>As to this event <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> admonishes the Thessalonians (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>) that they must not be terrified, as if the day of the Lord were at hand, for there must first come a revolt (<em>he apostasia</em>).The Fathers and interpreters understand by this revolt a great reduction in the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> through the abandonment of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> by many nations. Some <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> cite as confirmatory of this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> the words of Christ: "But yet the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on earth?" (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs8">Luke 18:8</a>).
<h3 id="E">The reign of Antichrist</h3>

<p>In the passage above mentioned (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs3">2 Thessalonians 2:3 sqq.</a>) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> indicates as another sign of the day of the Lord, the revelation of the man of sin, the son of perdition. "The man of sin" here described is generally identified with the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, who, says St. John (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs18">1 John 2:18</a>), is to come in the last days. Although much obscurity and difference of opinion prevails on this subject, it is generally admitted from the foregoing and other texts that before the Second Coming there will arise a powerful adversary of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who will seduce the nations by his wonders, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h3 id="F">Extraordinary perturbations of nature</h3>

<p>The Scriptures clearly indicate that the judgment will be preceded by unwonted and terrifying disturbances of the physical <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs29">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="../bible/luk021.htm#vrs25">Luke 21:25-26</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, pestilences, famines, and earthquakes foretold in <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs6">Matthew 24:6 sq.</a> are also understood by some writers as among the calamities of the last times.
<h3 id="G">The universal conflagration</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> writings we are told that the end of the world will be brought about through a general conflagration, which, however, will not annihilate the present <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, but will change its <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and appearance (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs10">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/1th005.htm#vrs2">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="../bible/rev003.htm#vrs3">Apocalypse 3:3</a>, and <a href="../bible/rev016.htm#vrs15">16:15</a>). Natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> shows the possibility of such a catastrophe being produced in the ordinary course of events, but <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> generally tend to believe that its origin will be entirely <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>.
<h3 id="H">The Trumpet of Resurrection</h3>

<p>Several texts in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> make mention of a voice or trumpet which will awaken the dead to <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs52">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs15">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs28">John 5:28</a>). According to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/5086.htm#article2">Supplement 86:2</a>) there is reference in these passages either to the voice or to the apparition of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>.
<h3 id="I">"The sign of the Son of Man appearing in the heavens"</h3>

<p>In <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs30">Matthew 24:30</a>, this is indicated as the sign immediately preceding the appearance of Christ to judge the world. By this sign the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> generally understand the appearance in the sky of the Cross on which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> died or else of a wonderful cross of light.
<h2 id="section3">Circumstances accompanying the general judgment</h2>
<h3 id="A">Time</h3>

<p>As was stated above, the signs that are to precede the judgment give no accurate indication of the time when it will occur (<a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs32">Mark 13:32</a>). When the Disciples asked the Saviour: "Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?" He answered: "It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or moments, which the Father hath put in his own power" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs6">Acts 1:6-7</a>). The uncertainty of the day of judgment is continually urged by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles as an incentive to vigilance. The day of the Lord will come "as a thief" (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs42">Matthew 24:42-43</a>), like lightning suddenly appearing (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs27">Matthew 24:27</a>), like a snare (<a href="../bible/luk021.htm#vrs34">Luke 21:34</a>), as the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a> (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs37">Matthew 24:37</a>).
<h3 id="B">Place of the judgment</h3>

<p>All the texts in which mention is made of the Parusia, or Second Coming, seem to imply clearly enough that the general judgment will take place on the earth. Some commentators infer from 1 Thessalonians 4:16, that the judgment will be held in the air, the newly risen being carried into the clouds to meet Christ; according to others the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08419a.htm">Joel</a> (<a href="../bible/joe003.htm#vrs1">3:1 sq.</a>) places the last judgment in the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">Valley of Josaphat</a>.
<h3 id="C">The coming of the Judge</h3>

<p>That this judgment is ascribed to Christ, not only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also as Man, is expressly declared in Scripture; for although the power of judging is common to all the Persons of the Trinity, yet it is specially attributed to the Son, because to Him also in a special manner is ascribed wisdom. But that as Man He will judge the world is confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs26">John 5:26-27</a>). At the Second Coming Christ will appear in the heavens, seated on a cloud and surrounded by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs27">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs30">24:30</a>; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs31">25:31</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will minister to the Judge by bringing all before Him (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs31">Matthew 24:31</a>). The <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> will aid Christ in a judicial capacity (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 6:2</a>). The lives of the just will in themselves be a condemnation of the wicked (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs41">Matthew 21:41</a>), whose punishment they will publicly approve. But the Apostles will be judges of the world in a sense yet more exact, for the promise that they shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs28">Matthew 19:28</a>) seems to imply a real participation in judicial authority. According to a very probable opinion, this prerogative is extended to all who have faithfully fulfilled the counsels of the Gospel (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs27">Matthew 19:27-28</a>). Nothing certain is known as to the manner in which this delegated authority will be exercised. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> conjectures that the greater <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will make known the sentence of Christ to others (<a href="../summa/5088.htm#article2">Supplement 88:2</a>).
<h3 id="D">Those to be judged</h3>

<p>All men, both good and bad, according to the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>, will appear in the judgment to give an account of their deeds. As to children that have personally done neither good nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> must be distinguished from the unbaptized. The former appear in the judgment, not to be judged, but only to hold the glory of Christ (<a href="../summa/5080.htm#article5">Supplement 80:5</a>), while the latter, ranked with the wicked, although not judged, will be enabled to realize the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> loss (Suarez). The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will not be judged directly, since their eternal destiny has already been fixed; yet, because they have exercised a certain influence over the fortunes of men, the sentence pronounced on the latter will have a corresponding effect on them also (<a href="../summa/5089.htm#article8">Supplement 89:8</a>).
<h3 id="E">Object of the judgment</h3>

<p>The judgment will embrace all works, good or bad, forgiven as well as unforgiven <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, every idle word (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs36">Matthew 12:36</a>), every secret thought (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). With the exception of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach that even the secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the just will be made manifest, in order that judgment may be made complete and that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be glorified. This will not pain or embarrass the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but add to their glory, just as the repentance of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> is to these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> a source of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.
<h3 id="F">Form of the judgment</h3>

<p>The procedure of the judgment is described in <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs31">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, and in the <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs12">Apocalypse 20:12</a>. Commentators see in those passages allegorical descriptions intended to convey in a vivid manner the fact that in the last judgment the conduct and <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> of each individual will be made plain not only to his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> but to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the assembled world. It is probable that no words will be spoken in the judgment, but that in one instant, through a Divine illumination, each creature will thoroughly understand his own <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> and that of every fellow creature (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs15">Romans 2:15</a>). Many believe, however, that the words of the sentence: "Come, ye blessed", etc. and "Depart from me", etc. will be really addressed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the multitude of the saved and the lost.
<h2 id="section4">Results of the general judgment</h2>

<p>With the fulfilment of the sentence pronounced in the last judgment the relations and the dealings of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> with the creature find their culmination, are explained and justified. The Divine purpose being accomplished, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> will, as a consequence, attain its final destiny. The reign of Christ over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> will be the sequel of the General Judgment.
