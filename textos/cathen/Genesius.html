<h1>Genesius</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Genesius (of Rome)</h2>

<p>A comedian at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> in 286 or 303. Feast, 25 August. He is invoked against epilepsy, and is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as patron of theatrical performers and of musicians. The legend (Acta SS., Aug., V, 119) relates: Genesius, the leader of a theatrical troupe in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, performing one day before the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Emperor Diocletian</a>, and wishing to expose <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rites to the ridicule of his audience, pretended to receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. When the water had been poured upon him he proclaimed himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> at first enjoyed the realistic play, but, finding Genesius to be in earnest, ordered him to be tortured and then beheaded. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on the Via Tiburtina. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are said to be partly in San Giovanni della Pigna, partly in S. Susanna di Termini and in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. The legend was dramatized in the fifteenth century; embodied in later years in the <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a> "Polus Atella" of L&ouml;we (d. 1869), and still more recently in a work by Weingartner (Berlinn 1892). The historic value of the Acts, dating from the seventh century, is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, though defended by <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> (M&eacute;moires, IV s.v. Genesius). The very existence of Genesius is called into question, and he is held to be a Roman counterpart of St. Gelasius (or Gelasinus) of Hierapolis (d. 297). He was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, however, at Rorne in the fourth century: a church was built in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> very early, and was repaired and beautified by <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> in 741.
<h2 id="section2">Genesius of Arles</h2>

<p>A notary <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a> in 303 or 308. Feast, 25 Aug. He is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as patron of notaries, and invoked against chilblains and scurf. The Acts (Acta SS., Aug., V, 123, and Ruinart, 559), attributed to <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, state: Genesius, native of Arles, at first a soldier became known for his proficiency in writing, and was made secretary to the magistrate of Arles. While performing the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was read in his presence. Outraged in his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the young <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> cast his tablets at the feet of the magistrate and fled. He was captured and executed, and thus received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in his own blood. His veneration must be very old, as his name is found in the ancient <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. A church and altar dedicated to him at Arles were known in the fourth century.
<h2 id="section3">Genesius (Bishop of Clermont)</h2>

<p>Twenty-first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, d. 662. Feast, 3 June. The legend, which is of a rather late date (Acta SS., June, I, 315), says that he was descended from a senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Auvergne. Having received a Iiberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he renounced his worldly prospects for the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> under Bishop Proculus, and succeeded him in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> in 656. He laboured earnestly for the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality, and founded a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> and also the Abbey of Manlieu. After five years, fearing for his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he left Clermont secretly and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the garb of a pilgrim. The bereaved flock sent a deputation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Genesius was found and induced to return. He then built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Chantoin. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church which he had built at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Symphorian, and which later took his own name. In the life St. Prix (Praejectus), Genesius is mentioned as one of the protectors of his childhood.
<h2 id="section4">Genesius (Count of Clermont)</h2>

<p>Died 725. Feast, 5 June. According to the lessons of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the Chapter of Camaleria (Acta SS. June, I, 497), he was of noble birth; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name is given as Audastrius, and his mother's is Tranquilla. Even in his youth he is said to have wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>--to have given sight to the blind and cured the lame. He built and richly endowed several churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. He was a friend of St. Bonitus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and of St. Meneleus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Menat. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Combronde by St. Savinian, successor of Meneleus.
<h2 id="section5">Genesius (of lyons)</h2>

<p>(Or GENESTUS.) Thirty-seventh <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, d. 679. Feast, 1 November. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, not of Arabia or <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> as is sometimes stated and became a religious and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (not of Fontenelle, but) attached to the court and camp of Clovis II where he acted as chief almoner to the queen, St. Bathildis. He succeeded St. Chamond (Annemundus) in the See of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 657 or 658. His name is found for the first time as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in a signature of 6 Sept., 664, attached to a charter drawn up by Bertefred, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, for the Abbey of Corbie. On 26 June, 667, he subscribed another charter framed by Drauscius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> founded by Ebroin, mayor of the palace, and his wife Leutrude. In the conflict between Ebroin and St.Leger (Leodegarius), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, Genesius (675-76) took the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and was in consequence attacked by an armed band sent by Ebroin to expel him from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; but Genesius collected a force and successfully defended his city. In September, 677, he assisted at an assembly held at Maslay. He was succeeded at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> by Landebertus. His body remained in the church of <a href="../cathen/11053a.htm">St. Nicetius</a> till the beginning of the fourteenth century, when it was transferred to Chelles.
