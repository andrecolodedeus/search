<h1>Genoa</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF GENOA (JANUENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in Liguria, Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on the gulf of the same name, extends along the lowest ridges of the Ligurian Apennines, which sweep around the gulf, between the mouths of the Polcevera and the Bisagno, and is protected from the inroads of these waters by the Punta della Lanterna and the Punta del Carignano. The bay forms a natural harbour secured against storms by the promontory of Portofino, which acts as a breakwater. Two piers (the smaller one begun in 1133) were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to break the force of the tide during storms. Its favourable position has made Genoa the largest trade centre on the Mediterranean. It is also a naval fortress with a chain of defences about ten miles in length.

<p>In 205 B.C., Mago the Carthaginian landed there with a large army, and sacked the town for its sympathy with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the rest of Liguria supporting the Carthaginians. From the end of the Second Punic War, Genoa belonged to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the Lombard invasion, it remained subject to Byzantium, like nearly all the maritime towns of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In A.D. 641 King Rotari, in his expedition along the coast of Liguria, sacked Genoa, and carried off immense booty. It was later incorporated in the Lombard kingdom, probably under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, becoming part of the March of Obertenga. In 935, it was surprised and sacked by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, but the Genoese fleet followed up the enemy and defeated them near the island of Asinara. In 1008, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> came for the third time. Meanwhile the trade and enterprise of Genoa had steadily increased, and now rivalled that of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, in those early times its friendly neighbour. In 1016, they drove the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> chief Mogalied from <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. In 1052, the town organized itself into a commune, and was governed by consuls and a podest&agrave; (mayor); in 1258, however, the control was divided between the podest&agrave; and a "captain of the people", a condition which lasted till 1310. From 1339 to 1797, except when the rule was in the hands of foreigners, the city was governed by doges chosen from the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, at first for life, but after 1528 for periods of two years.

<p>In 1087, the Genoese and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> captured Almadia and Subeila in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> their fleet transported the crusading armies to the Holy Land, secured many ports in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and, in return for their services, they were granted important commercial privileges among the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Christian principalities of the East</a>. Together with the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> they aided <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> to put down the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Anacletus, and, as a reward, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> divided between the two municipalities the islands of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, retaining, however, his own overlordship. In 1147, they took Almeria and Tortosa, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. The threatening attitude of Genoa forced <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> to recognize all its liberties and possessions; hence, until the reign of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, it remained friendly to the imperial cause, and even assisted in the attack on <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. In 1240, however, the Genoese refused to do homage to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, and, in 1241, they lent their fleet to transport the northern <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to the council convened by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, but were pursued and defeated between the islands of Il Giglio and Monte Cristo by the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, the allies of the emperor. In 1244, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> took refuge in Genoa. The commercial favour shown by the Latin Empire of Constantinople (1204-60) towards the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> enabled the latter to defeat the Genoese at St-Jean d'Acre and on the high seas, in 1257 and 1258 respectively. In 1261, the Genoese took their revenge by assisting Michael Pal&aelig;ologus to reconquer Constantinople, and obtained from him Smyrna and Pera, and the monopoly of trade in the Black Sea. They developed markets rapidly on the shores of this sea, the principal one being Caffa, and carried on a brisk trade, exporting mainly wine, oil, woollens, and silks, and importing skins, furs, corn, Persian stuffs, etc. For the government of these colonies, a general consulate of the empire of Gazaria was established.

<p>A bitter <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> now began between the rival cities of Genoa and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. From 1262 to 1267, five naval battles (Settepozzi, <a href="../cathen/05209a.htm">Durazzo</a>, <a href="../cathen/15023a.htm">Trapani</a>, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and St-Jean d'Acre) were fought, in which Genoa was generally the loser. St. Louis IX of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> sought to establish peace on a firm footing (Cremona, 1270); but a revolt in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, stirred up by the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, soon led to another <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1282-1284), which ended in the utter defeat of the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> near the island of Meloria. Soon the old rivalry with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> was renewed, and the scene of the conflict shifted to the East. At Laiazzo, on the coast of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, the Genoese were victorious (1294); the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> retaliated by destroying the Genoese quarter of Galato (1296), but in 1298 Lamba Doria (founder of the Doria <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, famous in the annals of Genoa) totally destroyed the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> fleet at Curzola. Both rivals being now weakened, Henry VII (1311) easily obtained from the Genoese the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to govern them for twenty years, and a promise of help against <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. A little later, Robert of Anjou (1318-1335) was called in by the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> in opposition to the Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, favoured by the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, together with the Greeks and the Catalonians, wished, in 1342, to occupy the island of Scio as an outpost against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the Genoese, profiting by a quarrel among the allies, forestalled them. This, amongst other causes, led to a fresh outbreak of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in 1350. In the Bosphorus (1352), a fierce but indecisive battle was fought; while at <a href="../cathen/01310d.htm">Alghero</a> in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> (1353) the Genoese were defeated by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and their allies. Genoa then chose Giovanni Visconti, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, as its ruler of "Signore". In 1354, Paganino Doria routed the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> forces in the Adriatic and at Porto Longone in the Morea (Greece). Driven out of the Black Sea, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> took Beirut by way of compensation, and Genoa seized <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (1373). When the Greek Emperor, John V, gave the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> the island of <a href="../cathen/14506b.htm">Tenedos</a>, the Genoese, fearing lest the former should thereby have access to the Black Sea, espoused the cause of Andronicus; in this way broke out the conflict known as the War of <a href="../cathen/03689a.htm">Chioggia</a>. The Genoese, defeated at Anzio (1378), were victorious at Pola (1379) and blockaded <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to surrender when the blockade was broken by Vettor Pisani. The great rivals were now exhausted.



<p>During the fifteenth century, Genoa constantly called on outsiders to rule her, but as constantly rebelled against their rule (1396-1409, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; 1409-1413, Teodoro II Paleologo di Monferrato; 1422-1435, Filippo Maria Visconti; 1458-1461, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; 1464-1478, 1487-1499, the Sforza of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; 1499-1512, 1515-1522, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). Meanwhile her colonies in the East were slipping away (Pera, 1453; Caffa, 1475). In 1431, at Portofino, the fleet in the service of Visconti was defeated by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> and Florentine allies. Genoa was involved in the conflict between <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and in 1522 was sacked by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. In 1527, the Spanish were expelled by the celebrated Andrea Doria with French aid, and in the year following Andrea succeeded in ridding himself of his French allies. The "Signoria" was offered him, but he prudently refused the title, though in reality he exercised its powers. This brought about the Fieschi Plot (1546), which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> abortive owing to the death of its leader. Noteworthy events in the subsequent history of Genoa are the attempts of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> to shake off Genoese authority (1553; 1737, King Theodore), its annexation by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1768, and the two conspiracies for the annexation of Genoa by <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> (Vachero, 1628; Della Torre, 1672). In 1684, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, without any just cause, had the town bombarded. A hundred years later (1797) the French set up there a democratic republic. In 1800, Mass&eacute;na sustained a famous siege and blockade on the part of the Austrians and English. In 1805, the duchy was annexed to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but in 1814 was provisionally, and in 1815 definitely, annexed to the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Kingdom of Sardinia</a>.

<p>Genoa owes to the magnificence of its architecture its title of "La Superba" (the Proud). Among its best-known churches are: San Lorenzo, rebuilt in the twelfth century, the lower part of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1100, the remainder from 1523. The spandrils over the door are decorated with <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> of various periods. The <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> dates from 1567. There are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/02303a.htm">Barrocci</a>, <a href="../cathen/06047a.htm">Ferrari</a>, <a href="../cathen/03209b.htm">Cambiaso</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Montorsoli, <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>, Guglielmo della Porta and others. Near by is the little church of St. John the Baptist, formerly the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the city. The church of Saints Andrew and Ambrose (600) has <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a> and <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>. Santissima Annunziata has beautiful Composite columns, and a famous Last Supper by Procaccino. In the church of <a href="../cathen/03446b.htm">St. Catherine of Genoa</a> (with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> room adjoining) may be seen her body preserved in a silver urn. The church of Saints Cosmas and Damian antedates the year 1000; that of St. Donatus, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1189, is built of old Roman materials. <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> dates from 1694; the Ges&ugrave; Maria from 1487. The latter has <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Paggi, <a href="../cathen/03209b.htm">Cambiaso</a>, and Salimbeni. St. George's has two bronze doors, a part of the booty of <a href="../cathen/01328a.htm">Almeria</a> (1148). The altar of St. John's was erected after the victory at Pola. On the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of St. Mark's (1173) is a marble lion captured from the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> at Pola. Other churches are: Santa Maria in Castello (columns of oriental granite); Santa Maria del Carmine (rich tabernacle); San Siro (the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> till 985); San Stefano, which existed in 493, and has a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>. San Matteo, containing the war-trophies of the Dorias, was founded in 1125 by Martino Doria, and restored by Andrea Doria from plans by Fra Giovanni Angelo Mortorsoli; on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is the sarcophagus of Lamba Doria, the victor at Curzola; under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Andrea Doria by Montorsoli, and several inscriptions recall the triumphs of this noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of seamen and rulers. Santa Maria in Carignano (sixteenth century), one of the handsomest churches in the world, is in the form of a Greek cross; its <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> is the work of <a href="../cathen/01284a.htm">Galeazzo Alessi</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. The Campo Santo, or public cemetery, is also greatly admired for its beautiful statuary. Among Genoa's public edifices are the Albergo dei Poveri, or home for the poor (1655), with a church attached; the Loggia dei Banchi, or exchange, built by <a href="../cathen/01284a.htm">Galeazzo Alessi</a>. The Palazzo Ducale (1291) is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with a row of stucco <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the various princes and kings defeated by the Genoese; its spacious halls were adorned by famous artists. The Palazzo S. Giorgio (1260), restored in 1368, has many <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the doges of the fifteenth century. Worthy of notice also are the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, founded in 1471 by Bartolomeo Bianco, the Palazzo Reale, and the Municipio or Town Hall. Genoa has many famous private palaces, e.g. the Adorno, with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>. the Doria, with a representation of St. George and the Dragon over the doorway. Besides the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, there is a merchant-marine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> high school, an academy of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> and other institutions of a similar nature.

<p>The line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is usually dated from St. Solomon or Salonius, said to have been <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 269. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are mentioned in the third and fourth centuries, the first known with any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> being Diogenes, a member of the Council of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> in 381. Blessed Jacobus a Voragine, author of the Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend) and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Genoa (1292-1298), tells us that till the tenth century he found no mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Genoa, thus proving that in his time nothing was known of the legendary <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The St. Syrus I assigned to the beginning of the fourth century may therefore be a double of St. Syrus II (1139-1163). When the Lombards captured <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (568), its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Laurentius, and many of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> took refuge in Genoa; five other <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took up their residence there. It was this same Laurentius who dedicated the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Ambrose built for the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> refugees. About 617, Bishop Appellinus became involved in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Agrestius. In 634, Bishop Asterius <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> St. Byrsinus, who was to be one of the apostles of Northumbria.

<p>Councils were held at Genoa in 773 (?), 1216, and 1292. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/01159a.htm">Adrian V</a> were natives of the city. It was originally a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but, in 1133, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> made it a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. Its first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was the St. Syrus mentioned above. Its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are <a href="../cathen/01258a.htm">Albenga</a>, <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, Brugnate and Luni-Saranza, <a href="../cathen/03652c.htm">Chiavari</a>, <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona and Noli</a>, <a href="../cathen/14784c.htm">Tortona</a>, <a href="../cathen/15343a.htm">Ventimiglia</a>. In has 200 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 470,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (161,000 in the city); there are 33 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men in the city, and 19 throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; also 62 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the city, and 82 throughout the diocese.
