<h1>Geoffrey of Clairvaux</h1>  

<p>A disciple of Bernard, was b. between the years 1115 and 1120, at Auxerre; d. some time after the year 1188, probably at the abbey of Haute Combe, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. At an early age he entered the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and followed for some time the course of lectures given by <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>. In 1140 <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> came to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and before the assembled scholars preached a sermon "De conversione ad clericos" (P.L., CLXXXII, 832 sqq.), in which he dwelt on the vanities of a life in the world, on the necessity of a sincere conversion, and on the peace to be found in the monastic profession. Geoffrey was so struck by this forcible discourse that, with several others, he followed St. Bernard and joined the monastic community of Clairvaux. Soon he won the special confidence of the saintly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, became his <em>notarius</em>, or secretary, and his permanent companion. In 1145 he accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and other cities of Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> preached against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> or <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of a certain Henry and his partisans. During the years 1146-47 he travelled with St. Bernard through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> aroused people for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to the Holy Land. At the council held at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1148 he took an active part in the discussion concerning the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e. In 1159 he was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Igny in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and in 1162 he became the fourth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux. Owing to difficulties with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, he was forced to resign in 1165; but in 1170 he was appointed to the Abbey of Fossa Nuova in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in 1176 to that of Haute Combe, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In the political events of the time he had only a small share; thus, in 1167 and 1168, he took part in the negotiations tending towards the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-81) with the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederic Barbarossa</a> (1152-90) and King Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1154--89)

<p>Most of the literary activity of Geoffrey has reference to the life and work of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. Thus, while still <em>notarius</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, he collected the letters of his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, variously estimated at 243 or 310 (P.L. CLXXII, 67 sqq.) He was the chief author of a life of St. Bernard in five books, furnishing materials for the first two books, revising them, and adding three of his own (P.L., CLXXXV, 225 sqq.) He also wrote fragments of a life of St. Bernard, probably used in the first books of the complete life (P.L., CLXXXV, 523 sqq.); an account of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> journey to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in a letter to his teacher Archenfredus (P.L., CLXXXV, 410 sqq.); an account of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> journey through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the third part of the sixth book of St. Bernard's life in P.L., CLXXXV, 395 sqq. (this description and the parts in the life of St. Bernard relating to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were edited also by Waitz, in Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., XXVI, 109-20, 133-37); a panegyric delivered in 1163 on the anniversary of Bernard's death (in P.L., CLXXXV, 573 sqq.); "Declamationes de colloquio Simonis cum Jesu" (in P.L., CLXXXIV, 437 sqq.), an <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> work compiled from the sermons of St. Bernard; "Libellus contra capitula Gilberti Pictaviensis Episcopi (in P.L., CLXXXV, 595 sqq.), a refutation of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e; a letter to Albinus, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, on the same subject (P.L., CLXXXV, 587 sqq.); a life of St. Peter, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a> (1175), published in Acta Sanctorum Boll., May, II, 330 sqq.; a letter to the above-named <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, as to whether the water added to the wine in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is changed into blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Ann. Eccl. ad. an. 1188, n. 27); sermons and commentaries on books of Scripture, partly in print and partly <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
