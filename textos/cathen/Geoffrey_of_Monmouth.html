<h1>Geoffrey of Monmouth</h1>  

<p>(GAUFRIDUS ARTURUS, GALFRIDUS MONEMETENSIS, GALFFRAI or GRUFFYD AB ARTHUR).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> and chronicler; b. at Monmouth about 1100, d. at <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, 1154. He was the son of Arthur, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his uncle Uchtryd, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>. It has been surmised that he became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, but this is uncertain. At Oxford he met Walter the Archdeacon, who suggested to him the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his great work, "Historia Regum Britanniae". About 1140 he accompanied Uchtryd to <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, where he became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of St. Teilo's, and opened <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and chieftains were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. This "Historia" had appeared before 1139, but Geoffrey continued to work at it, and in 1147 he completed it in its final form. In 1151-2 he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Lambeth by <a href="../cathen/14567c.htm">Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, on 24 Feb., having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> a week before, but he died without having entered his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Geoffrey's "History" has been one of the great influences in <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>, making itself especially felt in the national romance from Layamon to Tennyson. <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, Milton, <a href="../cathen/05167b.htm">Dryden</a>, <a href="../cathen/12258c.htm">Pope</a>, and Wordsworth have all used his legends, while many of the earlier chroniclers followed him as an historian. But the twelve books of his "History", recounting how Brut, great-grandson of Aeneas, founded the kingdom, and narrating the adventures of subsequent kings, are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not history at all but the beginning of English story-telling. Among his legends is that of King Arthur, which became the most famous of the great cycles of romance so popular in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Geoffrey's legend having received a new form from <a href="../cathen/09573c.htm">Sir Thomas Malory</a> in the fifteenth century has again been given fresh life by Tennyson in the "Idylls of the Kings". Geoffrey claimed that his work was founded on a "most ancient book" &#151; probably a collection of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> legends no longer extant. Geoffrey also wrote a Latin version of the Cymric "Prophecies of Merlin" and a life of Merlin is attributed to him. His stories exercised a wide influence in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they furthered the unification of the English people by spreading <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a common origin of Briton, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a>, and Norman. The "Historia Britonum" was first printed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1508; the latest editions being those of <a href="../cathen/06559a.htm">Giles</a> (London, 1844) and Schulz (Halle, 1854).
