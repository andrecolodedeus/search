<h1>Geography and the Church</h1>  

<p>The classic historians of geography, Alexander von Humboldt, Carl Ritter, and Oscar Peschel, never forgot to acknowledge how greatly their <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> was indebted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Of course the beginnings of all profane <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> can be traced back to the time when "priest" and "scholar" meant one and the same thing. But with geography especially the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had very close relations &#151; relations which are readily explained by the nature of this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and the course of its evolution.

<p>The object of geography is to extend our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the earth's surface and to determine the position of our planet in relation to cosmic and physical phenomena. For the fulfilment of its first and more important task, the accumulation of geographic information, the prerequisites were at hand even in the earlier days. It needed only intrepid men to penetrate from known to unknown countries. But the powerful incentive of a purely scientific interest was still lacking. The motives that led to geographical progress at that time were <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of conquest, as well as a far nobler motive than these &#151; the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. To this mission the most intelligent, the most upright, and the most persevering of all explorers devoted themselves. Consequently, it was they who achieved the greatest success in the field of discovery during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and far into later days, right up to the time when modern scientific research became its successor. The second purpose, geographical theory, commonly called universal geography, could only be profitably attempted after adequate progress had been made in the auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, mathematics, and physics. But herein, too, <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> scholars were the first to show their clearsightedness. For them there was no more attractive pursuit than to trace the vestiges of the Creator in all the marvellous harmony of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. How, then, was it possible that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing this globe of ours could escape their search for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Of course, they could only have a presentiment of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> but frequently enough their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> came very close to the precise results of the great modern scientists, equipped with the best of modern instruments. Again, one of the greatest of them all was a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a>.

<p>Under these circumstances it was inevitable that the part contributed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to this branch of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> should be of great importance, as the most distinguished geographers bear witness. We may therefore rightfully present a coherent picture thereof. To this end we have divided the subject according to the following aspects: <ul><li>I. The Influence of the Activity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the Discoveries of New Lands and Races during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; <li>II. The Views and Statements of Medieval <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a>; <li>III. The Opening up of Foreign Lands by Missionaries from the Age of Discovery down to the Present Day, and the Part Borne by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Scholars in Modern Geographical Research.</ul>
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The confines of the world as known to geographers at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> are shown in the famous geography of the Alexandrian, Claudius Ptolem&aelig;us (150 <font size=-2>A.D.</font>). Southwards they extended to the White Nile and the northern boundary of the Sudan; in the west they included the Canary Isles and the British Isles; to the north they reached as far as the German Seas and thence over the Low Countries of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the Aral Sea to the sources of the Indus and the Ganges. In the Orient they took in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a> and the coasts of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Indo-China as far as the Archipelago. Their certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, however, did not extend beyond the boundaries of the Roman Empire when it was at its zenith. At the very time when this empire was falling to pieces, it was overrun by the peaceful missionaries of the new spiritual power, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Even in the first few hundred years they found their way to the Far East. According to tradition, the Apostle Thomas himself reached Meliapur. In any case <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had been spread in <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, on the coast of Coromandel, in Socotra and Ceylon as early as the fourth century, as <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a> informs us in his "Christian Topography", a very important work from a geographic standpoint. Even in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> and in Southern Arabia the Faith found a footing. Simultaneously the frontier lands on the Rhine and the Danube were opened up. The subsequent centuries were spent in exploring the North. To this end a centre of operations was established which, for the purpose of the scientific discoverer could not have been more wisely selected in the conditions then prevalent. Then followed the foundation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the British Isles which sent out in all directions their <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, well equipped with learning and well fitted to become the pioneers of culture. To these missionaries we owe the earliest geographical accounts of the northern countries and of the customs, <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, and languages of their inhabitants. They had to define the boundaries of the newly established <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Their notes, therefore, contained the most valuable information, though the form was somewhat crude, and Ritter very justly traces the source and beginning of modern geography in these regions back to the "Acta Sanctorum". The world is indebted to the diaries of St. Ansgar (died 865) for the first description of Scandinavia. The material in them was employed later on by <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> in his celebrated work "De situ Dani&aelig;". The accounts of these countries that Archbishop Axel of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a> (died 1201), the founder of Copenhagen, furnished to the historian <a href="../cathen/13497a.htm">Saxo Grammaticus</a> were also of great value. Reports brought in by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> enabled <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">Alfred the Great</a> (901) to compile the first description of Slavonic lands. Then followed the Chronicle of Regino of Pr&uuml;m (907-968) &#151; a work equally important for the historian and the geographer, as it contains the reports of <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, who made his way into <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 961. Of similar merit are the historical works of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Nestor of Kiev (died 1100) and the country <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> <a href="../cathen/07212a.htm">Helmold</a> (died 1170). Bishops <a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Thietmar of Merseburg</a> (died 1019) and <a href="../cathen/15438a.htm">Vincent Kadlubeck</a> of Cracow (1206-18) bring us the earliest information regarding the geography of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, while the letters of Bishop Otto of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> contain the earliest description of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>. In like manner the geography of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08797a.htm">Lapland</a>, and Lithuania begins with the evangelization of these countries. And even if it be difficult today to estimate at their proper value the discovery of these regions now so familiar to us, the first voyages of civilized <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> on the high seas, which started from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, will always challenge our admiration. Groping from island to island, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> reached the Faroe Isles in the seventh century and Iceland in the eighth. They thus showed the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> the route which was to bring about the first communication between <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America, and finally set foot on Greenland (1112). The earliest accounts of these settlements, with which, owing to unpropitious political and physical conditions, permanent intercourse could not be maintained, we owe to Canon <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a>, to the reports sent by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> at Drontheim (Trondhjem), and to the Vatican archives.



<p>Meanwhile, communication with the East had never ceased. Palestine was an object of interest to all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, to which the eyes of the West had been turned ever since the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Thousands and thousands of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> flocked thither in bands. Not a few of them possessed sufficient ability to describe intelligently their experiences and impressions. Thus the so-called "Itineraries", or guide-books, by no means confined themselves to a description of the Sacred Places. Besides giving exact directions for the route, they embraced a great deal of information about the neighbouring countries and peoples, about <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. These works were very popular reading and undoubtedly infused an entirety new element into the study of geography in those days. A still greater stimulus was given to it by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> &#151; those magnificent expeditions which, inspired and supported by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, brought huge masses of people into contact with the Orient. They made a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the lands they sought to conquer, a commonplace in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. They were the means of spreading the geographic theories and methods of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> scholarship, at that time quite advanced, thereby placing the research of Western scholars on entirely new bases, and putting before them new aims and objects. Finally, in the effort to secure new allies for the liberation of the Holy Land, they brought about intercourse with the rulers of Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. This intercourse was of the utmost importance in the history of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> discoveries.

<p>Stray communities of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were scattered throughout the interior of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, even in the early centuries, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they were separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and were suppressed by rigorous persecutions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> as early as the eighth century. But even during the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> some Mongolian tribes showed such familiarity with the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had great hopes of an alliance with these nations. The general council held at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1245 under <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> decided to send out <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. Men duly qualified for these missions were found among the newly established Orders of St. Francis and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Ascalinus in 1245 reached the court of the Khan of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> on the eastern shore of the Black Sea after a voyage of fifty-nine days, but his errand was fruitless. His companion, Simon of St-Quentin, wrote an account of the voyage, as did also his great contemporary, <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a>. The enterprises of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were politically more successful, and far more productive of scientific results. Under the leadership of John de Piano Carpini of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, they travelled through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> as far as the Volga, and thence to the Court of the Grand Khan at Karakorum (1246). Their reports embrace the political conditions, ethnography, history, and geography of the Tatar lands. They were excellently supplemented by Friar Benedict of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> of the same order in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> countries. Both these works, however, are surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13217a.htm">William Rubruck (Rubruquis)</a> of Brabant, whose report Peschel pronounces to be "the greatest geographical masterpiece of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>". He was the first to settle the controversy between <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> geographers as to the Caspian Sea. He ascertained that it was an inland lake and had not, as was supposed for a long while, an outlet into the Arctic Ocean. He was the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> geographer to bring back reliable information concerning the position of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and its inhabitants. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the ethnographic relations of the Hungarians, Bashkirs, and Huns. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of the remains of the Gothic tongue on the Tauric Chersonese, and recognized the differences between the characters of the different Mongolian alphabets. The glowing pictures he drew of the wealth of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> first attracted the attention of the seafaring <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> to the East. Merchants followed in the path he had pointed out, among them <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, the most renowned traveller of all times. His book describing his journeys was for centuries the sole source of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for the geographical and cartographical representations of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Side by side with <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> pursued untiringly the work of discovery. Among them was Hayton, Prince of Annania (Armenia), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, who in 1307 made the first attempt at a systematic geography of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> in his "Historia orientalis". Also the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> stationed in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> who followed the more convenient sea route to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> at the end of the thirteenth century. Special credit is due to John of Monte Corvino (1291-1328), <a href="../cathen/12281a.htm">Odoric of Pordenone</a> (1317-31), whose work was widely circulated in the writings of <a href="../cathen/09587b.htm">JohnMandeville</a>, and John of Marignolla. Of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, also, the missionaries gave fuller information. Menentillus was the first to prove the peninsular shape of the country and, in contradiction to Ptolemy, described the Indian Ocean as a body of water open to the South. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Jordanus Catalani (1328) records his observations on the physical peculiarities and natural history of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. At the same time more frequent visits were made to Northern Africa and <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>; and towards the middle of the fourteenth century settlements were made in the Canary Isles.

<p>However, the immense tracts of land in the interior of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> were soon closed again to scientific investigation. With the fall of the Mongol dynasty, which had been favourably disposed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> became forbidden ground to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>. But the East remained the goal of Western trade, to which the missions had shown the way. The rich lands on the Indian Ocean remained open, and henceforth they were the objective point of all the great exploring expeditions, undertaken by the sea-loving Portuguese, which culminated in the discovery of America by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>. It is well known how much these undertakings were furthered by the all-pervading <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of spreading <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The main object of Henry the Navigator in equipping his fleet with the revenues of the Order of Christ was the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. He was working to the same purpose on the continent of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where he sought to establish communications with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ruler of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. His efforts led to the circumnavigation of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> by his successors, and to the systematic exploration of the highland states of East Africa begun by Portuguese missionaries in the sixteenth century. <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, too, was regarded in his time as pre-eminently the envoy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Furthermore, the strange results expected from his expedition and his own projects were the last echo of all the aspirations of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, which contemplated a way to the Kings of Cathay (China) whose disposition to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had been repeatedly emphasized by <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Toscanelli</a>, as well as the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Earthly Paradise</a>, which <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> placed somewhere near the gulf of Paria, the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre by means of the treasures he expected to find, and, finally, the extension of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> over the entire earth before the approaching end of the world.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>Philosophical speculation also had a share in the magnificent success that <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the practical work of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Although geography as a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> for its own sake was no more the chief purpose of this speculation than exploration for its own sake was that of the missionaries, it had arrived at <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that are admitted today, even when tested by the light of modern research &#151; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that must be recognized as real progress. As might be expected, in the early centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> men strove above all things to reconcile deductions from the observation of the facts of nature with the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> that were then supposed to be taught in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature was so predominantly <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> that the teachings of the ancients were always tested in order to see whether they were in harmony with <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Hence it was that several of the Fathers pronounced in favour of the theory of the flatness of the earth's surface which had been put forward in later Roman cosmographies. Among the advocates of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> were <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, Severian of <a href="../cathen/06328a.htm">Gabala</a>, Procopius of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and others. <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a> advanced an especially grotesque elaboration of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. In his exaggeratedly narrow interpretation of the phraseology of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> he claimed that the world was constructed in the shape of the Tabernacle of the Covenant in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. But long before his day there were men who believed in the sphericity of the earth. It was recognized by Clement and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> and Basil also upheld it. <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> even sought to explain the origin of the earth by means of a physical experiment, and advanced hypotheses that come very close to the modern theories of rotation. Augustine declared that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the sphericity of the earth in no way conflicted with <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, and later authors, especially the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, also attempted to prove it on scientific grounds. For a considerable period the question of the Antipodes was beset with controversy. It was absolutely denied by Lactantius and several others, principally on religious grounds, as the people of the Antipodes could not have been saved. The learned Irishman, Bishop Virgilius, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (died 784) was the first to openly express the opinion that there were men living beyond the ocean. Individual physiographical phenomena also began to come under the observation of the learned, such as the influence of the moon on the tides, the erosive action of the sea, the circulation of water, the origin of hot springs and volcanoes, the division of land and water, the position of the sun at different latitudes. The learning and opinions of the first few hundred years were comprehensively set forth in the tremendous work of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a> (died 636), the "Etymologi&aelig;" or "Origines", which for a long time enjoyed unlimited authority. During the next few centuries, which were comparatively barren of literary achievements, the only men to attain any celebrity, besides <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and Virgilius of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, were the anonymous geographer of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (c. 670), the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/04778c.htm">Dicuil</a>, author of the well-known "Liber de mensur&acirc; Orbis terr&aelig;" (c. 825), and the learned Pope Sylvester (999-1003), otherwise known as Gerbert of Aurillac, the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> of his century. The oldest cartographic documents we have also date from the same period. They rely for their information on the earth's surface substantially on the Roman methods of delineation. The lost map of the world as known to the Romans can now be reconstructed only by means of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <em>Mapp&oelig; mundi;</em> consequently, they exhibit all the deficiencies of the model they followed; they are circular in plan and were drawn neither on projection nor according to scale, the boundaries of the provinces being indicated by straight lines. The central point was in the &AElig;gean Sea; at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> it was transferred to Jerusalem, the East being at the top of the maps. In addition to adhering to the Roman form, these maps have preserved for us also the contents of the Roman maps; and therein lies the principal value of these interesting documents. They were often draughted with the greatest and most artistic care. Especial importance attaches to the map of the world made by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Beatus. Numerous copies of this show the entire area of the globe as known in 776 after Christ. Of the big wall maps only those in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> at Ebsdorf have survived. Both of them are of the latter half of the thirteenth century and are representative of the ancient type of map. Small atlases were largely circulated in cosmographical <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>. These are known as Macrobius atlases, Zone atlases, Ranulf atlases, and so forth. Special maps have also come down to us; two of them, showing south-eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Palestine are even attributed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. There is a representation of Palestine in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> in the church at Madaba; this dates from the middle of the sixth century. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a>, draughted same modern maps in the thirteenth century which were quite free from the influence of Ptolemy and the Arabians.

<p>But geographical problems made great and unexpected progress when they received a more scientific basis. This basis was provided by the scholastics when they made the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> system the starting-point of all their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> researches. Their thorough <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> training and their strict critical method gave to the work of these commentators on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> the value of original research, which strove to comprehend the entire contemporary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of nature, As at the same time the Almagest of Ptolemy was brought to light again by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, <a href="../cathen/06468a.htm">Gerard of Cremona</a> (1114-87), there was not a single problem of modern physical and mathematical geography the solution of which was not thus attempted. The fact that the writings of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and Ptolemy, on which they founded their investigations, had already passed through the hands of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> scholars, who, however, probably received them at some time from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of advantage to the consequent geographical discussions. The most eminent representative of physical studies was <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>; of mathematics, <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>. Their precursor, <a href="../cathen/15632b.htm">William of Conches</a>, had already given evidence of independent conception of the facts of nature in his "Philosophia Mundi". Also <a href="../cathen/10734a.htm">Alexander Neckham</a> (1150 to about 1227), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cirencester, whose "Liber de natur&acirc; rerum" contains the earliest record of the use of the mariner's compass in navigation and a list of remarkable springs, rivers, and lakes. Blessed <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> (1193-1280), a master with whom in the universality of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> only Alexander von Humboldt is comparable, opened up to his contemporaries the entire field of physiography, by means of his admirable exposition of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, laid the foundations of climatology, botanical geography, and, in a certain sense, even of comparative geography. His work "De c&oelig;lo et mundo" treats of the earth as a whole; his "libri meteororum" and "De passionibus aeris" include meteorology, hydrography, and seismology. In the "De natur&acirc; locorum" he enlarges upon the system of the zones and the relations between man and the earth. He furnished <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the sphericity of our planet that are still popularly repeated today; be calculated accurately the duration of the day and the seasons in the different quarters of the globe. Ebb and flow, volcanology, the formation of mountain-ranges and continents &#151; all these subjects furnish him material for clever deductions. He carefully recorded the shifting of coastlines, which men at that time already associated with the secular upheaving and subsidence of continents. He also ascertained the frequency of earthquakes in the neighbourhood of the ocean, He closely observed fossilized animals. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the direction of the axes of mountain-ranges influenced the climate of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and, on the authority of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> writers, he was the first to refute the old <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that the intertropical surface of the earth must necessarily be quite parched. His fellow-friar, <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> (died 1264), also proved himself to be a very keen observer of nature. A great mass of geographical material is stored up in his "Speculum naturale". Among other things he recognized that mountain-ranges constantly lose in height, owing to the influence of climate and of rain, and that in high altitudes the temperature falls because of the decrease of atmospheric density. Finally, we must mention the original views of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> on geography, as well as those of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> Ristoro of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, Brunetto Latini (1210-94), his great disciple, <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> (1266-1321), and, lastly the "Book of Nature" by Conrad of Megenberg, canon of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1309-1378). For all of these <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> had opened the door to the rich treasure-house of Greek and Arabian learning. Still more far-reaching in their results were the labours of the scholars who applied themselves principally to mathematical geography. At the bead of them all stands <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>, the "Doctor Mirabilis" of the Order of St. Francis (1214-94). <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> was emboldened to carry out his great project on the strength of <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Bacon's</a> assertion that <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> could be reached by a westerly voyage &#151; a claim based on mathematical computation. Even before Ptolemy's "Geography" had been rediscovered, <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Bacon</a> attempted to sketch a map, determining mathematically the positions of places, and using Ptolemy's Almagest, the descriptions of Alfraganus, and the Alphonsine Tables. Peschel pronounces this to be "the greatest achievement of the scholastics". Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly (1350-1425), whose "Imago Mundi" was also a favourite book of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus's</a>, founded it on <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Bacon's</a> works. It is to him and Cardinal Filiaster that Western civilization owes the first Latin translation of Ptolemy's "Geography", which Jacopus Angelus finished and dedicated to <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Pope Alexander V</a> (1409-10). The circulation of this book created a tremendous revolution, which was particularly beneficial to the development of cartography for centuries thereafter. As early as 1427 the Dane Claudius Clavus added to Filiaster's priceless <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Ptolemy's work his map of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the oldest map of the North which we possess. Domnus Nicolaus Germanus, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> (of Reichenbach?) (1466), was the first scholar who modernized Ptolemy by means of new maps and made him generally accessible. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Andreas Walsperger (1448) made a map of the world in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> style. That of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> Fra Mauro (1457) is the most celebrated of all monuments of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> cartography. It was already enriched by data furnished in Ptolemy's work. The map of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> designed by <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> (1401-64), a pupil of <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Toscanelli</a> (1387-1492), was printed in 1491. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was the teacher of Peuerbach (1432-61), who in turn was the master of Regiomontanus (1436-67), the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> since Ptolemy. <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> enabled Regiomontanus to study Greek, and <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a> (1474) entrusted the reformation of the Calendar to him. We must also mention &AElig;neas Sylvius (afterwards <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretaries Poggio and <a href="../cathen/02575a.htm">Flavio Biondo</a>, who made several valuable contributions to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of geography, also <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Cardinal Bembo</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Reisch (1467-1525).
<h2 id="section2">II</h2>

<p>In order to set forth properly the achievements in discovery and research in modern times by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars, we adopt Peschel's arrangement. He divides this period of the development of geography into two main epochs: <ul><li>(1) That of discovery, up to the middle of the seventeenth century; <li>(2) That, of geographical measurement, from 1650 down to the present day.</ul>

<p>We cannot set down all the names of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and missionaries which we find in both these periods. Their chief usefulness lay in their contributions to the general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of various countries and races. But they also made contributions of the greatest value to the theoretical development of our <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. They were the first and foremost promoters of many studies auxiliary to geography that sprang Up in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, such as ethnology, meteorology, volcanology, and so forth.
<h3>1</h3>

<p>Even on their earliest voyages the great discoverers took with them learned <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. These men wrote glowing accounts of the wonders they saw in the newly discovered lands to their brethren at home, so that they might spread the information broadcast. In a short time monastic settlements sprang up in the great colonial possessions of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were the first missionaries to America, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> are heard of in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> as early as 1500, while the Augustinians accompanied <a href="../cathen/09526b.htm">Magellan</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in 1521. They were equipped with the best available aids and assistants. Among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> especially these received a thorough and systematic training. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established missions on the Congo, in 1547, in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, in 1549, in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, 1555, in South Africa, 1559, in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, 1568, in Mexico, 1572, in <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>, 1586, and in <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, 1591. They even penetrated into the old <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> civilizations of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> (1549) and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (1563).

<p>Soon after the discovery of the West Indies, the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> Fray Roman wrote a valuable study of the mythology of their inhabitants, which Ferdinand Columbus incorporated in his "Vida del Almirande". It became the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of American ethnology. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Bias de Castillo explored the crater of Masaya in <a href="../cathen/11046a.htm">Nicaragua</a>, in 1538, which Oviedo also visited and described later. The much-admired work "De rebus oceanicis et novo orbe" was written by Peter Martyr d'Anghierra (1475-1526), <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, and a friend of Columbus. It is especially noteworthy for its intelligent observations on ocean currents and volcanoes, which its author doubtless derived from missionaries. A most signal contribution was the "Historia natural y moral de las Indias" (1588), by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/01108b.htm">Jos&eacute; d'Acosta</a> (1539-1600), who lived in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> from 1571 to 1588, and proved himself one of the most brilliant writers on the natural history of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> and the customs of the Indians. The first thorough exploration of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, under Father Ferre (1599-1632) and others. Starting from <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> visited the region around the source of the Amazon in 1633. Father Laureano de la Cruz penetrated as far as the River Napo in 1647, and in 1650 made a journey by boat as far as the Par&aacute; River.

<p>To missionaries, also, we owe important information concerning the interior of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> during the sixteenth, and at the beginning of the seventeenth, century. The Portuguese <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Alvarez and Berm&uacute;dez accompanied the embassy of King Emanuel to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> III of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. They sent home valuable reports regarding the country. They were followed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. A. Tern&aacute;ndez crossed Southern <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, as far as Melinde, in 1613, and set foot in regions which until recently were closed to the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>. Father Paez (1603) and Father Lobo (1623) were the first to reach the source of the Blue Nile. As early as the middle of the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> drew a map of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> on the information supplied by these two men and by Fathers Almeida, <a href="../cathen/10183a.htm">M&eacute;ndez</a>, and T&eacute;lez. It was the best map of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> until the time of <a href="../cathen/01006e.htm">Abbadie</a> (1810-97). At the request of Bishop Migliore of S. Marco, the Portuguese Duarte L&oacute;pez (1591) wrote an important description of the Congo territory. The "Etiopia Oriental" (1609) by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13464a.htm">Juan dos Santos</a> was an authority on the lake country and eastern Central Africa until Livingstone's transcontinental expedition. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries Machado, Affonso, and Paiva in 1630 even thought of establishing communication between <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> and the Congo territory. The Arabian Leo Africanus, whom <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> had <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, and who was named after him, wrote a book describing the Sudan. It was published by Ramusio in 1552 and was considered the only reliable authority on this country till the nineteenth century. More careful research led to the sending of missionaries to Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. The Augustinian Gonz&aacute;lez* de Mendoza made the first really intelligible map of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1585, and Father Benedict Goes opened the land route thither, after a perilous journey from <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, in 1602. Thereupon the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci</a> and <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Schall</a>, both learned mathematicians and astronomers, prepared the cartographic survey of the country. <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Ricci</a> (1553-1610), as the "geographer of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>", is justly compared to <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, the "discoverer of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>". Using his notes, Father Trigault issued an historical and geographical treatise on <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1615. <a href="../cathen/01468d.htm">Father Andrada</a> visited Tibet in 1624, and published, in 1626, a book describing it which was afterwards translated into five languages. <a href="../cathen/02689a.htm">Borrus</a> and Rhodes published reports on Farther <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of cartography now made a quite Unexpected advance, due to the frequent and repeatedly enlarged editions of Ptolemy's work that were issued by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Ruysch (1508), by Bernardus Sylvanus (1511), Waldseem&uuml;ller (1513), and others. Canon Martin Waldseem&uuml;ller's map of the world (St-Di&eacute;, 1507) was his most distinguished achievement. It was the first to give to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> the name of America. Bishop Olaus Magnus, one of the most illustrious geographers of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, made a map of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1539. He also undertook a long journey in the North in 1518-19 and was the first man to propound the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a north-east passage. The great map-makers Mercator and <a href="../cathen/11328b.htm">Ortelius</a> also received devoted help and encouragement from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>.

<p>The most important result of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> and physiographical observations made during this period was the discovery and establishment of the heliocentric system by <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a>, canon of K&ouml;nigsberg (1473-1543). Celio Calcagnini (1479-1541) had prepared the way for this theory. In spite of the fact that his hypothesis was in direct contradiction to hitherto accepted interpretations of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, such high dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as Schomberg, Giese, Dantiscus, and others encouraged <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> to make public his discovery. Moreover <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> graciously accepted the dedication of the work "Be revolutionibus orbium c&oelig;lestium" which appeared in 1543. Among the foremost astronomers was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Scheiner (1575-1650). He and his assistant Cysatus were the first to notice the spots on the sun (1612), and founded the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of heliographic physics, of which <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> had not even thought. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Schyrl (Schyrl&aelig;us) de Rheita built a terrestrial telescope in 1645 and drew a chart of the moon. Nor did isolated physical phenomena pass unnoticed; attempts had already been made to classify them systematically. Giovanni Botero (1560-1617), secretary to <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, ranked with Peter Martyr among the first writers on deep-sea research &#151; or thalassography, and is considered to be the founder of statistical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. His "Relatione del mare" (1599) is the earliest known monograph on the subject of the ocean. He was followed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Fournier, whose significant "Hydrographie" (1641) treats encyclopedically of oceanic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. At Ingolstadt (Eck and Scheiner) and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (Celtes, Stabius, Tannst&auml;tter) geography was treated with especial care. The first professor of geography at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> was Barthel Stein, who entered a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> in 1511 and completed a description of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> in 1512-13. Cochl&aelig;us (1479-1552), <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, sought to make the scientific study of ancient authors (Meteorology of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Geography of Mela) a part of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He instilled a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of geography into his pupils which at that time was without equal. <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> opponent, wrote a much-praised work on the physical geography of mountains and rivers for his lectures at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/02689a.htm">Borrus</a> was the forerunner of Halley the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>. He drew up a chart showing the magnetic variations of the compass in 1620.

<p>About the middle of the seventeenth century it was left almost exclusively for missionaries, going about their unselfish, silent, and consequently much under-estimated labours, to continue geographical research until, towards the end of the eighteenth century, great expeditions were sent out, supported by states and corporations and equipped with every possible scientific and technical aid and appliance. The missionaries achieved results from their work that entitle them to the credit of having been the pioneers of scientific geography and its strenuous co-operators. Bold expeditions exploring the interior of continents became more frequent. Numerous reports on <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> from the hands of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, dated between the years 1632 and 1672, have been preserved. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Friar Gabriel Sagard, commonly called Theodat, sojourned among the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> from 1624 to 1626. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Bouton (1658) and de Tertre (1687) devoted a few pamphlets to the Antilles and the Carib tribes. It was at that time that the great rivers of America for the first time became adequately known. Under the leadership of La Salle, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Hennepin</a>, de la Ribourde, and <a href="../cathen/10172b.htm">Membr&eacute;</a> penetrated to the Great Lakes and Niagara Falls in 1680 and the following years. The same men navigated the Mississippi, of which even the Delta had been scarcely known until then. Mexico and <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> as far as the Rio Colorado were traversed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> <a href="../cathen/08660a.htm">Kino</a> (1644-1711), Sedlmayer (1703-1779), and <a href="../cathen/02201b.htm">Baegert</a> (1717-1777). We find that between 1752 and 1766 &#151; eighty years before Meyer, the celebrated circumnavigator of the globe &#151; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Wolfgang Beyer reached Lake Titicaca. Father Manuel Ramon sailed up the Cassiquiare from the Rio Negro to the Orinoco in 1744 and anticipated <a href="../cathen/04210a.htm">La Condamine</a>, Humboldt, and Bonpland in proving that this branch connected these streams. Father Samuel Fritz, from 1684 on, recognized the importance of the Mara&ntilde;on as the main river and source of the Amazon. He drew the first reliable map of the entire course of the stream. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Techo (1673), Harques (1687), and Duran (1638) wrote about Paraguay, and d'Ovaglia (1646) about <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, the most interesting country in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, was suddenly closed to missionaries about 1630. It was not until 1699 that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Br&eacute;vedent, with the physician Poncet, once more ventured up the Nile and into the interior of the country; but in so doing he lost his life. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> <a href="../cathen/03468c.htm">Cavazzi</a> (1654), <a href="../cathen/03349a.htm">Carli</a> (1666), Merolla (1682), and Zucchelli (1698) accomplished remarkable results in the Congo region. Even as late as the year 1862 the geographer Petermann made use of their writings to construct a map of that region.

<p>But the greatest scientific triumphs attended the work of the missionaries in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Especially remarkable were the successful attempts to penetrate into <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, a feat which <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> did not repeat until our times. After <a href="../cathen/01468d.htm">Andrada</a>, whom we have already mentioned, followed Fathers Grueber and d'Orville, who reached Lhasa from Pekin in 1661 and went down into <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> through the Himalaya passes. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Desideri (1716-29) and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> Della Penna (1719-1746) and Beligatti (1738) spent considerable time in this country.

<p>To these travels must be added the splendid achievements in cartography and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, which, about 1700, caused a complete revolution in the development of geography. It was due chiefly to them that one of the most powerful States of that time, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, lent its support to this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, thus offering an example that resulted in a series of governmental subventions giving the development of geography its most powerful impetus. In 1643 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Martin Martini (1614-61) landed in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. During his sojourn he acquired a personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of most of the provinces of that immense empire and collected his observations in a complete work, that appeared in 1651, entitled "Atlas Sinensis". In Richthofen's opinion it is "the fullest geographical description of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> that we have". Moreover, it contains the first collection of local maps of that country. <a href="../cathen/08661a.htm">Athanasius Kircher</a> further drew the attention of scholars the world over to the Celestial Empire in his "China monumentis illustrata" (1667). He, too, had at his disposal information gathered by missionaries. And finally the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/15346a.htm">Verbiest</a> succeeded in arousing the interest of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> by the advice he sent home to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. At his request, six of the most learned <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> went to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1687; they were Fathers Bouffe, Fontaine, Gerbils, Le Comte, and Viscous. They bore the title of "royal mathematicians" and at the expense of the French Crown were equipped with the finest instruments. From 1691 to 1698 Gerbils, court <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> to the emperor, made several excursions to the hitherto unknown region on the northern boundary of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. He presented a map of the environs of Peking to the emperor who then ordered the survey of the Great Wall, which was completed by Fathers Bouffe, R&eacute;gis, and Jared. This achievement was followed in the succeeding years by the mapping of the entire empire. Fathers Jartoux, <a href="../cathen/06303a.htm">Fridelli</a>, Cardoso, Bonjour (Augustinian), de Tartre, de Mailla, <a href="../cathen/07358a.htm">Hinderer</a>, and R&eacute;gis undertook the work. By 1718 the map was finished. In addition to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> proper it embraced <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a> and <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, as far as the Russian frontier. Simultaneously, a delineation of <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a> as far as the sources of the Ganges was begun. The map ranks as a masterpiece even today. It appeared in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> itself in 120 sheets and since that time has formed the basis of all the native maps of the country. Fathers Espinha and <a href="../cathen/01323a.htm">Hallerstein</a> extended the survey to Ili. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Du Halde edited all the reports and letters sent to him by his brethren and published them in 1735 in his "Description g&eacute;ographique, historique, chronologique, politique et physique de l'empire de la Chine et de la Tartarie chinoise" (4 vols.). The material for the maps in this work was prepared by d'Anville, the greatest geographer of his time. All modern maps can be traced back to his "Atlas de la Chine". Still later, there were published in fifteen volumes the "M&eacute;moires concernant l'histoire . . . des Chinois, par les missionaires de Pekin" (Paris, 1776-91).

<p>Many of the missionaries belonged to the learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, London, and St. Petersburg. They exchanged letters on scientific topics with such renowned scholars as Leibniz, Linn&aelig;us, John Ray, Duperron, Delisle, Marinoni, Simonelli, and others. The influence of widely read periodical publications is also noteworthy. Among them were the "Lettres &eacute;difiantes et curieuses &eacute;crites des missions &eacute;trang&egrave;res", numerous volumes and repeated editions of which were published in the eighteenth century. They contained a mass of geographical material. The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of geography profited by this intercourse between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> scientists. The greatest need at that time was the definite determination of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> positions in order to construct a really faultless map of the world. Thanks to the sound training in <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries before they went abroad, their missionary stations soon gathered many excellent determinations of latitude and longitude. As early as the middle of the seventeenth century they produced a great mass of reliable data from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Between 1684 and 1686 they determined the exact position of the Cape of Good Hope, of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and Louveau (Siam). This enabled them to make a correct map of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> which had until then shown an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of nearly 25 degrees of longitude towards the east. By order of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06065a.htm">Father Louis Feuill&eacute;e</a>, the learned <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and pupil of <a href="../cathen/03405b.htm">Cassini</a>, revised uncertain positions in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America. He made surveys in Crete, <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and Tripoli, in 1701-02, in the Antilles and Panama, 1703-05, in South America, 1707-12, and in the Canary Isles, 1724. Thus Delisle and d'Anville, the reformers of map-making, built up their work on the scaffolding furnished them by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In the attempts to determine the length of a degree of longitude made in the seventeenth century, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> took a very prominent part. As early as 1645 Fathers Riccioli and <a href="../cathen/07034a.htm">Grimaldi</a> tried to determine the length of a degree on the meridian. Similar work was done in 1702 by Father Thoma in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; in 1755, by Fathers <a href="../cathen/02691a.htm">Boscovich</a> and Maire in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>; in 1762, by Father Liesganig in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and in the same year by <a href="../cathen/10086a.htm">Father Christian Mayer</a>, in the Palatinate, also by Fathers Beccaria and Canonica in northwestern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1774).

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> engaged in geodetic work in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, South America, and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, we meet with Father Velarde (1696-1753), who published the first approximately accurate map of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> about 1734. G. Matthias Vischer, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Leonstein in Tyrol (1628-95), drew a map of Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1669 that was republished as recently as 1808. Father Liesganig, in conjunction with Fathers von Mezburg and Guessmann, designed maps of Galicia and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. <a href="../cathen/10086a.htm">Father Christian Mayer</a> drew a map of the Rhine from Basle to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Father Andrian, a chart of Carinthia. Fathers Grammatici (1684-1736), Dechalles, and Weinhart must also be mentioned.

<p>In view of the lively intercourse between the missionaries and the members of their orders in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> it is not surprising that the latter also compiled voluminous geographical summaries. Such are the works of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Riccioli (1598-1671), the "Almagestum Novum" and "Geographia et Hydrographia reformata" (1661). Riccioli was a worthy contemporary of the great Varenius, and was really entitled to rank as a reformer, especially in cartography. <a href="../cathen/08661a.htm">Father Athanasius Kircher</a> (1602-80) among other things devoted himself to physics. His most original observations are set down in his "Magnes, sive de arte magnetic&acirc;" (1641) and his "Mundus subterraneus" (1664). He made the ascent of Vesuvius, Etna, and Stromboli, at the risk of his life in order to measure their craters. On the basis of his observations he advanced a theory concerning the interior of the earth which was accepted by Leibniz and, after him, by an entire <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of geologists, the Neptunists. He also was the author of the first attempt at a physical map, to wit, the chart of ocean currents (1665).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Heinrich Scherer (1628-1704), professor at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, devoted his entire life to geographical study. He incorporated in his works all that was then known of the earth. His "Geographica hierarchica" contains the earliest mission atlas. The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of map-making owes much to him. His "Geographia naturalis" contains the first orographical and hydrographical synoptic charts. His "Geographia artificialis" recommends a system of cartographic projection which the geographer Bonne, in 1752, accepted and carried out as one of the best. Alongside of these mighty works, which, in imitation of the great encyclopedic works of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, attempt to give a survey of the whole geographical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a period, we now meet in increasing numbers the equally important treatises on special subjects which resemble the works of our modern scientists. The name of the Dane <a href="../cathen/14286a.htm">Nicholas Steno</a> is one of the foremost in the history of geology. He was tutor to the sons of Grand Duke Cosimo III and later <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the Northern Missions (1688-87). In the opinion of Zittel he was far in advance of his time. He was the first scientist to attempt the solution of geological problems by induction. He was also the first scholar who clearly conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the history of the earth could be inferred from its structure and its component parts. His little monograph "De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento" (1669) was the foundation of crystallography and stratigraphy, or the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the earth's strata. One of the most painstaking geologists of the eighteenth century was the <a href="../cathen/14209a.htm">Abbate Lazzaro Spallanzani</a> (1729-99). With him rank Fathers de la Torre (Storia e fenomeni del Vesuvio, 1755), Fortis (1741-1803), Palassou (La min&eacute;ralogie des Monts Pyren&eacute;es, 1782), <a href="../cathen/14784b.htm">Torrubia</a> (1754, in America and the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>), Canon Recupero, at <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a> (died 1787), and many others.

<p>The history of meteorology tells the same story as that of mathematical geography. This <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> also depended on widely scattered observations which could only be obtained from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> scattered over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Raineri, a pupil of <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>, made the first records of the fluctuations of the thermometer. The first meteorological <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the "Societas Meteorologica Palatina" (1780-95), accomplished splendid results. Its founder was the former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Johann Jacob Hemmer. Almost all of its correspondents belonged to the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The rapid growth of ethnography and linguistics was rendered possible solely by the vast accumulation of materials made by the missionaries in the course of the centuries. There was hardly a writer of travels who did not to some extent contribute to them. While many of them occupied themselves with this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> exclusively, we mention here only the "pioneers of comparative ethnography", Fathers <a href="../cathen/05070b.htm">Dobrizhoffer</a> (1718-91), in <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>, and Lafiteux in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; the noted Sanskrit scholars Fathers <a href="../cathen/07131a.htm">Hanxleden</a> (1681-1782), C&oelig;urdeux (1767), and Paulinus a Santo Bartholomeo (1776-89, in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>), and, finally, the able Father Hervas (1733-1809). The latter's chief work, the "Catalogo de las lenguas" (1800-03), was published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither all the members of the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed Jesuit Order</a> had flocked.

<p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century the progress of geographical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, as was to be expected, is due chiefly to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who, without religious aims, have continued the work on the foundations already provided. The co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was of secondary importance, but it never entirely ceased, and, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to its great traditions, it has won a place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> even amid the stupendous achievements of modern research. By way of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, we close with the names of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Moigno (1804-84), the founder and publisher of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> periodicals "Le Cosmos" (1852-) and "Les Mondes" (1863-); of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> <a href="../cathen/13669a.htm">Secchi</a> (1818-78), who, among other things, invented the meteorograph in 1858; also of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers <a href="../cathen/07510a.htm">Huc</a> (1839-60), Gabet, and Armand David (died 1900). The last-named made themselves famous by their explorations in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, and Tibet. Finally, we should remember the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a>, meteorological, seismological, and magnetic observatories established by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> all over the world (Rome, Stonyhurst, Kalocsa, <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, Georgetown near Washington, <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, Belen in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, Ambohidempona in <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>, <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, Zi-ka-wei, Boroma, and Bulawayo on the Zambesi, etc.) and their periodical reports.
