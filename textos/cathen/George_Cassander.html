<h1>George Cassander</h1>  

<p>Flemish Humanist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 15 August, 1513 at Pitthem in West Flanders; d. 3 February, 1566, at Cologne. He studied at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where he was graduated in 1533. In 1541 he was appointed professor of belles-lettres at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, but resigned two years later, partly from a natural desire to travel for instruction, and partly in consequence of the opposition aroused by his pro-Reformation views. On his journeys, which were undertaken in the company, and at the expense of his friend, Cornelius Wouters, he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1544 came to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he settled permanently in the summer of 1549. He soon abandoned the classics for the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions, and had already published several classical, Biblical, and patristic treatises, when in 1556 he commenced a series of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works. His "Hymni Ecclesiastici" (1556) were followed in 1558 by the "Liturgica de ritu et ordine Dominic&aelig; coen&aelig; celebrand&aelig;". Both publications were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>. As a completion of the "Liturgica", his "Ordo Romanus" appeared (1558); and in 1560 the "Preces Ecclesiastic&aelig;" were published. Cassander's activity in promoting religious peace between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> began with the publication of his anonymous book: "De officio pii viri in hoc religionis dissidio" (1561). This work, written at the request of the jurist, Francis Baldwin, and submitted by him to the Colloquy of Poissy (Sept., 1561), gave offence to both sides. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> wrote a violent answer, in which he <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> berated Francis Baldwin as the author of the publication. On the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, William Lindanus, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">Roermonde</a>, remonstrated with Cassander by letter, and would have attacked him publicly had it not been for the intervention of a secretary of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.

<p>At the request of William, Duke of Cleves, Cassander wrote in 1563 a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>: "De Baptismo Infantium". It was supplemented in 1565 by "De Baptismo Infantium: Pars Altera". The treatise, "De sacr&acirc; communione Christiani populi in utr&acirc;que panis et vini specie" (Cologne, 1564), a plea in favour of the reception of communion under both species by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, attracted the attention of the Emperor Ferdinand I, who was himself a partisan of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. The latter, wishing to use the author as the peacemaker between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, invited him to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Cassander, prevented by illness from acting upon the invitation, wrote his "Consultatio de articulis Religionis inter Catholicos et Protestants controversis", which he addressed to Maximilian II (1564), as Ferdinand I had died before its completion. This work, however, failed to satisfy either side. It is most probable, though not universally admitted, that Cassander died in full submission to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He certainly always wished to remain a faithful member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but it is equally certain that some of his opinions were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> to the core. He advocated, for example, the division of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> doctrines into fundamental and non-fundamental articles, the supremacy of private judgement, and the human origin of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy. An incomplete collection of his works was issued at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1616, and placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> the following year.
