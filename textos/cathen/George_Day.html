<h1>George Day</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>; b. in Shropshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, c. 1501; d. 2 August, 1556. He was graduated at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> in 1520-1 and admitted Fellow of St. John's, 19 September, 1522. Though apparently always a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, Day submitted like too many others to the assumption by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy. He was made Master of St. John's in 1537, Vice-Chancellor of the University, and Provost of King's College (though not a fellow of it) by special exercise of the royal authority, in 1538. Consecrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> in 1543 by Cranmer, he firmly opposed the spread of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> under Edward VI. He answered in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense Cranmer's written questions on the "Sacrament of the Altar", defended the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> in the House of Lords, and voted against the bills for <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">Communion under both kinds</a>, and for the introduction of the new <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book. In his own diocese his preaching was so effective that, in October, 1550, the Council felt it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to send "Dr. Cox, the king's almoner, to appease the people by his good doctrine, which are troubled through the seditious preaching of the Bishop of Chichester and others", and, in the following December, Day was brought before the Council to answer for his disregard of an injunction to have "all the altars in every church taken down, and in lieu of them a table set up", &mdash; himself preaching on the occasion, if possible in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After repeated interrogations, his final answer was that "he would never obey to do this thing, thinking it a less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to suffer the body to perish than to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with that thing that his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> would not bear". For this "contempt" he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Fleet, and after further questionings was deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in October, 1551. From the Fleet he was transferred in June of 1552 into the keeping of Bishop Goodrich of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, then Lord Chancellor, in whose custody he remained until the death of Edward VI. <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> restored him at once to his dignity, besides naming him her almoner. In re-establishing the ancient worship she had, however, to proceed cautiously. Thus contemporary chroniclers record that Cranmer conducted Edward's funeral "without any cross or light", and "with a communion in English", though "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> preached a good sermon". Day again preached at Mary's <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. His previous sufferings prove the sincerity of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> from the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and his reconciliation to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had doubtless already been privately effected. His formal <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and confirmation in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> by <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Papal Legate</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 31 January, 1555. His death occurred only a year and a half later and he was buried in Chichester <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
