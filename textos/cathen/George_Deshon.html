<h1>George Deshon</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Congregation (or Institute) of St. Paul the Apostle</a>, b. at New London, Conn., <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 30 January, 1823; d. in New York, 30 December, 1903. He was a graduate (1843) of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Military Academy at West Point, where he was a classmate and roommate of General U.S. Grant. His standing in class was high (second) and he afterwards taught mathematics and ethics at the Academy. Deshon was promoted to the rank of captain, but resigned his commission, was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1851, and soon after became a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> Order. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1855 and became associated with Fathers <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Hecker</a>, Walworth, <a href="../cathen/07309b.htm">Hewit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02213a.htm">Baker</a>, all regularly employed in missionary work. With them he obtained in 1858 a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a>, and assisted in the formation of the new <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> Institute, the first house and church of which were built in New York in 1859. He remained in this house during the rest of this life, being novice-master for several years, and afterwards assistant superior and in charge generally of the temporal interests of the community, which owed much to his business ability. He also superintended throughout the building of the church of St. Paul the Apostle, in which his skill and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as an engineer, acquired at West Point, were of great service.

<p>Father Deshon spent a considerable part of his time on the missions, in which he was specially eminent in the practical instructions, though his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> were also most effective. A volume of his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> sermons was issued in 1901. He published in 1860 a book entitled "Guide for Catholic Young Women", which acquired an abiding popularity. Father Deshon was elected superior general of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> Institute in 1897. At that time houses had been founded in <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>. The last important act of his life was the founding of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> house in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, for which he arranged with Archbishop Quigley in the fall of 1903. Though his life-work was so largely practical, he was noted for his interior spirituality, his favourite <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> being the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> and cenobites of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and his spare time was always devoted to recollection and spiritual reading, in which he had evidently been occupied on the last night of his life, before retiring. He died suddenly of heart failure about midnight, having been just able to ring for assistance, and to receive the last rites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
