<h1>George Digby</h1>  

<p>Second Earl of <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the first earl, was ambassador, 1612; d. at Chelsea, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1677. As a boy of twelve he presented a petition at the bar of the House of Commons on behalf of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> who had been committed to the Tower by the Duke of Buckingham. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Magdalen College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he became M. A., 31 Aug., 1636. Shortly afterwards he entered into a correspondence with his kinsman, Sir Kenelm Digby, in which he attacked the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the struggle between king and Parliament he was at first on the side of the Parliament. He was elected member for Dorset in 1640 and was shortly afterwards made a member of the committee which undertook to impeach Strafford. When the impeachment was abandoned for process of <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">attainder</a>, however, he vigorously opposed it and thus incurred unpopularity with his own party. In 1641 he took his seat in the House of Lords as Baron Digby and joined the king's party. His advice to the king upon the retreat of the five members to the city, that they should be seized by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, was rejected by Charles, but, becoming known, added greatly to his unpopularity. Shortly afterwards, being summoned before the House of Lords to answer for his conduct, he fled to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Returning during the Civil War he fought at Edgehill and Lichfield, but resigned his command by reason of a quarrel with Prinee Rupert. In Sept., 1643, he was made secretary of state and privy councillor, in which offices he was not successful.

<p>In 1645 Digby replaced Rupert as lieutenant-general of the king's forces north of the Trent, but was defeated at <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a> Sands and fled to the Isle of Man. He next took service under the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he became a lieutenant-general in the French army in 1651. On 6 Jan., 1653, he succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as Earl of <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a> and was made Knight of the Garter. Owing to an unsuccessful intrigue against <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> he was ordered to leave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, where he visited Charles II then in exile. In 1657 he was reappointed secretary of state but again lost office on his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. On the Restoration he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, becoming a political opponent of Clarendon. This displeased the king, and Digby spent two years in concealment, till Clarendon's fall. Though a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> he spoke in favour of the Test Act, drawing a distinction between a "Catholic of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" and a "Catholic of the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". He was high Steward of <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford University</a> 1643-46 and again 1660-1663. He published "The Lord George Digbie's Apology for Himself" (1642) and "Elvira, a Comedy" (1667). Many of his speeches and letters were also published.
