<h1>George Ellis Pugh</h1>  

<p>A jurist and statesman, born at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>., 28 November, 1822; died there, 19 July, 1876. He was the son of Lot Pugh and Rachel Anthony. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at Miami University, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, O., graduating A.M. in 1843, he was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> in 1844, and won high repute as a lawyer in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, where he practised. He served in the Mexican War, 29 April(1847-1 April, 1848, as captain Co. F., 4th <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> V. I., and as aide-de-camp to General Lane, being commended for <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> at Atlexco, 19 Oct., 1847. He was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from Hamilton County, 1848-9; city solicitor, <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 1850; attorney-general, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>, 1852-54; and was elected to the United States Senate from <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 3 Dec., 1855-3 March, 1861. He was the first native of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> to sit in that body. His principal services were in the committees on public lands and on the Judiciary. Displaying great ability in discussion of the measures arising from the question of slavery and in the organization of the territories of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a> and Nebraska, he supported Douglass's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of popular sovereignty, and was defeated for re-election to the Senate in 1861 by Chase. He was delegate in 1860 to the Charleston-Baltimore Convention of the Democratic party, acting as chairman of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> delegation and supporting the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of Douglass. The reply to Yancey on the slavery question was most effective. Yancey blamed the northern delegates for "admitting slavery to be wrong and thus surrendering the very citadel of their argument". Pugh answered: "You mistake us; we will not do so." He defined the position of the northern democrats, setting out that while they were not opposed to the institution of slavery in the states where it existed, they were unalterably opposed to its extension into any free state and any territory without the untrammelled consent of the residents thereof, as ascertained by an appeal to the ballot.

<p>During the Civil War he advocated the exercise of every constitutional power by the Government to preserve the Union. Defeated for Lieutenant-Governor of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> in 1863, and for representative to the 29th Congress in the 1st <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> district in 1864, he was elected a delegate to the constitutional convention of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> in 1872, but declined to serve. His most noted legal argument was the appeal in habeas corpus proceedings on behalf of Vallandigham in 1863. The question involved was the power and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the court to free Vallandigham held in confinement under a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a>. Pugh urged release on the ground that the civil courts of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were open and unimpeded in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and that only through proceedings in them, and not by the exercise of military authority, could Vallandigham, a civilian, be lawfully <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. Soon after his marriage to Ther&egrave;se Chalfant, 22 Nov., 1855 both he and his wife were converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
