<h1>George Gervase</h1>  

<p>(Jervise.)

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born at Boscham, Suffolk, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1571; died at Tyburn, 11 April, 1608. His mother's name was Shelly, and both his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> and mother's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> had been long established in the County of Suffolk. Losing both <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in boyhood, he was kidnapped by pirates and carried off beyond seas, remaining in captivity over twelve years. He lost his religion during that period; but, when at last he was able to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and found that his brother Henry had become a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> exile in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> in order to be able to practise his religion, George followed him there, and was soon reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He entered the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1595, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1603. He at once went to the English mission. He laboured very successfully for over two years, but was arrested in June, 1606, and banished with several other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He then made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and there endeavoured to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, but, not being admitted for some unknown reason, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he received the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit. His brother Henry had obtained for him a comfortable living near <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, being anxious to preserve him from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> then raging in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. But George was determined to labour for the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of his native land, and succeeded in returning to his native <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but was soon arrested and incarcerated. Refusing to take the new <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance on account of its infringing on spiritual matters where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were concerned, he was tried, convicted of the offense of merely being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, under the statute 27 Elizabeth, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn. Some authorities say he did not receive the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit until a short time before his death from Father Augustine <a href="../cathen/02727c.htm">Bradshaw</a>.
