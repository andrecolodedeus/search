<h1>George Hay</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and writer, b. at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 24 Aug., 1729; d. at Aquhorties, 18 Oct., 1811. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> having been a non-juring Episcopalian, sentenced to banishment for his adherence to the Stuarts in 1715. Destined for a medical career, young Hay began his studies at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and when barely sixteen found himself summoned, after the battle of Prestonpans, to attend the wounded soldiers on the battlefield. He afterwards followed the army of Charles Edward for some months; but before the decisive fight at Culloden illness compelled him to return to Edinburgh. He was later arrested for having participated in the rising, and taken to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where he was kept in custody for twelve months. Here a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bookseller named Neighan gave him his first insight into <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, and on his return to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> he studied Gother's well-known work, "The Papist Represented and Misrepresented". An introduction to Father Seaton, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, was followed by a prolonged course of instruction, and Hay was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, making his first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a> 21 Dec., 1749.

<p>Debarred by the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> from graduating or receiving his medical diploma, he accepted an appointment as surgeon on a trading vessel bound for the Mediterranean. While in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, on his way to join his ship, he became acquainted with the illustrious Bishop Challoner. The result of their intercourse was that Hay determined to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and on the arrival of his vessel at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, Hay journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he studied in the Scots' College for nearly eight years. Among his fellow-students was the future <a href="../cathen/05525b.htm">Cardinal Erskine</a>. In April, 1758, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Cardinal Spinelli, and on his return to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> was appointed to assist Bishop Grant in the important district of the Enzie, in Banffshire. In 1766 Bishop Grant succeeded Bishop Smith as Lowland Vicar Apostolic, and soon afterwards procured the appointment of Hay as his coadjutor. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>, 1769, and thenceforward for nearly forty years sustained practically the whole burden of the vicariate.

<p>Of strong constitution and untiring energy, as well as sterling <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, he did an immense work for religion in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> during this period. The stress of his ministerial labours did not prevent him from doing much active literary work. He published the first English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bible printed in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>; but the work which secured his own reputation as a religious writer was his complete cycle of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> entitled "The Sincere, Devout, and Pious Christian" published 1781-86, and still recognized as a work of standard value. Bishop Hay's own life was a perfect example of that ordered devotion and assiduous labour which he inculcated in his writings, and his calm and equable temperament was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against the many trials and difficulties inseparable from his position as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> under the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>. The Scottish <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, numbering at this time some 25,000, were, through the operation of these iniquitous <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, in a condition little better than that of slaves or outlaws. Bishop Hay's efforts to procure some relief for his co-religionists aroused a storm of fanatical fury, and in February, 1779, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and house which he had recently built in Edinburgh were burned by the mob. Very inadequate compensation for this outrage was made by the magistrates, and the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1780, further delayed the long-hoped-for relief. In 1793, however, Bishop Hay had the satisfaction of seeing his flock released by Act of Parliament from the most oppressive of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>. He had meanwhile laboured not only for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at home, but also to improve the condition of the national colleges at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His great object, in regard to the college at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was to have it placed under the control of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> superiors. His efforts on behalf of the institute in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were interrupted by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, in which it was entirely swept away. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> last public work was the foundation of a new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Aquhorties, in Aberdeenshire, and here, after transferring, with the sanction of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, the entire government of the Lowland District to his coadjutor, Bishop Cameron, he died, deeply regretted, at the age of eighty-three.
