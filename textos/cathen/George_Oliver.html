<h1>George Oliver</h1>  

<p>Born at Newington in Surrey in 1781; died at <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> in 1861. After studying for some years at the Sedgley Park School, he entered Stonyhurst in 1796, went through the full training, and taught "humanities" for five years. Having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1806, he was sent the following year to the mission formerly belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was not, however, himself a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>; for during his Stonyhurst days the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had no canonical existence in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and although the members of the community kept the rule of St. Ignatius so far as was compatible with their circumstances, in the hope of a future restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, they continued to rank as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. When the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> took place, Oliver did not join it, but lived and died a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>. As a student of arch&aelig;ology he acquired considerable fame, and although some of his conclusions are not accepted at the present day, yet considering the limited sources of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which were available when he lived, his researches show both industry and judgement. Most of his work had a local bearing. He became a well-known authority on the history and antiquities of Devonshire, about which he wrote several standard works.

<p>The one which is best known to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in general is his Collections containing numerous biographical notices of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, in the West of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. On the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, when the Plymouth Chapter was erected (1852), Oliver was nominated as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>. He had already retired from active work, but continued to reside in his old house until his death. Among his works are: "The Monasteries of Devon" (1820); "History of Exeter" (1821); "Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Devon" (1828, 2nd edition, much changed, 1839); "Collections S.J." (1838); "A View of Devonshire in 1630" (1845); "Monasticon Diocesis Exoniensis" (1846); "Collections illustrating the history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Religion" etc. (1857); "Lives of the Bishops of Exeter" (1861); numerous pamphlets and smaller works, See Brushfield's Bibliography of his works, of which the frontispiece is a portrait of George Oliver.
