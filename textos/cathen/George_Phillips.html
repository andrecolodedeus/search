<h1>George Phillips</h1>  

<p>A canonist, born at K&ouml;nigsberg, 6 Sept., 1804; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 6 September, 1872, was the son of James Phillips, an Englishman who had acquired wealth as a merchant in K&ouml;nigsberg, and of a Scotchwoman <em>n&eacute;e</em> Hay. On completing his course at the gymnasium, George studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the Universities of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and G&ouml;ttingen (1822-24); his principal teachers were von Savigny and Eichhorn, and, under the influence of the latter, he devoted himself mainly to the study of Germanic law. After obtaining the degree of Doctor of Law at G&ouml;ttingen in 1824, he paid a long visit to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1826 he qualified at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> as <em>Privatdozent</em> (tutor) for German law, and in 1827 was appointed professor extraordinary in this faculty. In the same year he married Charlotte Housselle, who belonged to a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> settled in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. Phillips formed a close friendship with his colleague <a href="../cathen/08323a.htm">K.E. Jarcke</a>, professor at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> since 1825, who had entered the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1824. <a href="../cathen/08323a.htm">Jarcke's</a> influence and his own searching studies into <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> led to the conversion of Phillips and his wife in 1828 (14 May). <a href="../cathen/08323a.htm">Jarcke</a> having removed to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1832, Phillips accepted in 1833 a call to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> as counsel in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Ministry of the Interior. In 1834 he was named professor of history, and a few months later professor of law at the University of Munich. He now joined that circle of illustrious men including the two G&ouml;rres, M&ouml;hler, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, and Ringseis, who, filled with enthusiasm for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, laboured for the renewal of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, the defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and religious freedom, and the revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholarship. In 1838 he founded with Guido G&ouml;rres the still flourishing militant "Historischpolitische Bl&auml;tter". His lectures, notable for their excellence and form, treated with unusual fullness subjects connected with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests. In consequence of the Lola Montez affair, in connexion with which Phillips signed, with six other <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> professors, an address of sympathy with the dismissed minister Abel, he was relieved of his chair in 1847. In 1848 he was elected deputy of a M&uuml;nster district for the National Assembly of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, at which he energetically upheld the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. In 1850, after declining a call as professor to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, he accepted the chair of German law at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, and there resumed his academic activity. Invited to fill the same chair in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1851, he removed to the Austrian capital, and remained there until his death. Once (1862-7) he accepted a long leave of absence to complete his "Kirchenrecht". He always maintained his relations with his friends in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and other cities of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and never relaxed his activity in furthering <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. As a writer, his labours lay in the domain of German law, canon law, and their respective histories. At first his activity was directed mainly to the first-mentioned, his principal contributions on the subject being: "Versuch einer Darstellung des angels&auml;chsischen Rechtes" (G&ouml;ttingen, 1825); "Englische Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte", of which two volumes (dealing with the period 1066-1189) appeared (Berlin, 1827-8); "Deutsche Geschichte mit besonderer R&uuml;cksicht auf Religion, Recht und Verfassung", of which two volumes alone were issued (Berlin, 1832-4), deals with Merovingian and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> times; "Grunds&auml;tze des gemeinen deutschen Privatrechts mit Einschluss des Lehnrechts" (Berlin, 1838); "Deutsche Reichs- und Rechtsgeschichte" (Munich, 1845). After his call to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, however, Phillips recognized his chief task in the treatment of canon law from the strictly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standpoint. In addition to numerous smaller treatises, he published in this domain: "Die Di&ouml;zesansynode" (Freiburg, 1849), and especially his great "Kirchenrecht", which appeared in seven volumes (Ratisbon, 1845-72), and was continued by <a href="../cathen/15354a.htm">Vering</a> (vol. VIII, i, Ratisbon, 1889). This comprehensive and important work exercised a great influence on the study of canon law and its principles. Phillips also published a "Lehrbuch des Kirchenrechts" (Ratisbon, 1859-62; 3rd ed. by <a href="../cathen/10603a.htm">Moufang</a>, 1881) and "Vermischte Schriften" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1856-60).
