<h1>George the Bearded</h1>  

<p>(Also called THE RICH.)

<p>Duke of Saxony, b. at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, 27 August, 1471; d. in the same city, 17 April, 1539. His father was Albert the Brave of Saxony, founder of the Albertine line of the Wettin <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, still the ruling line of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, his mother was Sidonia, daughter of George of Podiebrad, King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Elector Frederick the Wise, a member of the Ernestine branch of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, known for his protection of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, was a cousin of Duke George. Albert the Brave had a large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and George, a younger son, was originally intended for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; consequently he received an excellent training in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and other branches of learning, and was thus much better <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> than most of the princes of his day. The death of his elder brother opened to George the way to the ducal power. As early as 1488, when his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was in Friesland fighting on behalf of the emperor, George was regent of the ducal possessions, which included the Margravate of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> with the cities of <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> and Leipzig. George was married at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, 21 November, 1496, to Barbara of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, daughter of King Casimir IV of that country. George and his wife had a large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of children, all of whom, with the exception of a daughter, died before their father. In 1498, the emperor granted Albert the Brave the hereditary governorship of Friesland. At Maastricht, 14 February, 1499, Albert settled the succession to his possessions, and endeavoured by this arrangement to prevent further partition of his domain. He died 12 September 1500, and was succeeded in his German territories by George as the head of the Albertine line, while George's brother Heinrich became hereditary governor of Friesland. The Saxon occupation of Friesland, however, was by no means secure and was the source of constant revolts in that province. Consequently Heinrich, who was of a rather inert disposition, relinquished his claims to the governorship, and in 1505 an agreement was made between the brothers by which Friesland was transferred to George, while Heinrich received an annuity and the districts of Freiberg and Wolkenstein. But this arrangement did not restore peace in Friesland, which continued to be an unceasing source of trouble to <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, until finally the duke was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, in 1515, to sell it to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> for the very moderate price of 100,000 florins. These troubles outside of his Saxon possessions did not prevent George from bestowing much care on the government of the ducal territory proper. When regent, during the lifetime of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the difficulties arising from conflicting interests and the large demands on his powers had often brought the young prince to the verge of despair. In a short time, however, he developed decided ability as a ruler; on entering upon his inheritance he divided the duchy into governmental districts, took measures to suppress the robber-knights, and regulated the judicial system by defining and readjusting the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the various law courts. In his desire to achieve good order, severity, and the amelioration of the condition of the people, he sometimes ventured to infringe even on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the cities. His court was better regulated than that of any other German prince, and he bestowed a paternal care on the <a href="../cathen/09140a.htm">University of Leipzig</a>, where a number of reforms were introduced, and <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, as opposed to <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, was encouraged.

<p>From the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in 1517, Duke George directed his energies chiefly to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Hardly one of the secular German princes held as firmly as he to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he defended its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and vigorously condemned every innovation except those which were countenanced by the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. At first he was not opposed to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, but as time went on and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> aim became clear to him, he turned more and more from the Reformer, and was finally, in consequence of this change of attitude, drawn into an acrimonious correspondence in which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, without any justification, shamefully reviled the duke. The duke was not blind to the undeniable abuses existing at that time in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1519, despite the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, he originated the Disputation of Leipzig, with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of helping forward the cause of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and was present at all the discussions. In 1521, at the Diet of Worms, when the German princes handed in a paper containing a list of "grievances" concerning the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, George added for himself twelve specific complaints referring mainly to the abuse of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> and the annates. In 1525 he combined with his <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> son-in-law, Landgrave Philip of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and his cousin, the Elector Frederick the Wise, to suppress the revolt of the peasants, who were defeated near Frankenhausen in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. Some years later, he wrote a forcible preface to a translation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> issued at his command by his private secretary, <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Hieronymus Emser</a>, as an offset to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> version. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> books were confiscated by his order, wherever found, though he refunded the cost of the books. He proved himself in every way a vigorous opponent of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, decreeing that <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a> was to be refused to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, and recreant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were to be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Merseburg. For those, however, who merely held anti-catholic opinions, the punishment was only expulsion from the duchy. The duke deeply regretted the constant postponement of the ardently desired council, from the action of which so much was expected. While awaiting its convocation, he thought to remove the more serious defects by a reform of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which had become exceedingly worldly in spirit and from which many of the inmates were departing. He vainly sought to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> the right, which was sometimes granted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to make official visitations to the conventual institutions of his realm. His reforms were confined mainly to uniting the almost vacant <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and to matters of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> management, the control of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> being entrusted in most cases to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a>. In 1525, Duke George formed, with some other German rulers, the League of Dessau, for the protection of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. In the same way he was the animating spirit of the League of Halle, formed in 1533, from which sprang in 1538 the Holy League of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> for the maintenance of the religious Peace of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>.

<p>The vigorous activity displayed by the duke in so many directions was not attended with much success. Most of his political measures, indeed, stood the test of experience, but in ecclesiastico-political matters he witnessed with sorrow the gradual decline of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and the spread of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> within his dominions, in spite of his earnest efforts and forcible prohibition of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Furthermore, during George's lifetime his nearest relations his son-in-law Philip of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and his brother Heinrich, joined the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. He spent the last years of his reign in endeavours to secure a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> successor, thinking by this step to check the dissemination of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> opinions. The only one of George's sons then living was the weak-minded and unmarried Frederick. The intention of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was that Frederick should rule with the aid of a council. Early in 1539, Frederick was married to Elizabeth of Mansfeld, but he died shortly afterwards, leaving no prospect of an heir. According to the <a href="../cathen/01112a.htm">act of settlement</a> of 1499, George's <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> brother Heinrich was now heir prospective; but George, disregarding his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> will, sought to disinherit his brother and to bequeath the duchy to Ferdinand, brother of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. His sudden death prevented the carrying out of this intention.

<p>George was an excellent and industrious ruler, self-sacrificing, high-minded, and unwearying in the furtherance of the highest interests of his land and people. As a man he was upright, vigorous and energetic, if somewhat irascible. A far-seeing and faithful adherent of the emperor and empire, he accomplished much for his domain by economy, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of order and wise direction of activities of his state officials. The grief of his life was <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Luther's Reformation</a> and the apostasy from the Old Faith. Of a strictly religious, although not narrow, disposition, he sought at any cost to keep his subjects from falling away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but his methods of attaining his object were not always free from reproach.
