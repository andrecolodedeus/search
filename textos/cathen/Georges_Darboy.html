<h1>Georges Darboy</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, b. at Fayl-Billot, near <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, 1813; <a href="../cathen/04168a.htm">killed by Communists at Paris</a>, 24 May, 1871. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1836, he served for a time as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Notre-Dame at Saint-Dizier and as professor at the Grand S&eacute;minaire of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, then joined <a href="../cathen/01180a.htm">Mgr. Affre</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1845, where from "pr&ecirc;tre auxiliaire &agrave; la maison des carmes" and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the Lyc&eacute;e Henri-IV, he soon rose to the position of canon of Notre-Dame, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Saint-Denis, having previously been made prothonotary Apostolic. In 1859 he was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">See of Nancy</a>. During his three years as incumbent of that see, he took a special interest in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> matters, established the Ecole-Saint-L&eacute;opold, enlarged the Grand S&eacute;minaire, and wrote (1862) his famous letter, "Sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de l'&eacute;tude". Promoted by an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 10 January, 1863, to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, made vacant by the death of Mgr. Morlot, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> within a year the basilica of Notre-Dame, then completely restored, and was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the titles of Grand Almoner, Senator, and Imperial Councillor. Though lacking the independence of <a href="../cathen/01180a.htm">Mgr. Affre</a>, the administrative skill of <a href="../cathen/13769a.htm">Mgr. Sibour</a>, and the affability of Cardinal Morlot, Darboy was a learned, conscientious, and respected <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. With the help of such men as Buquet, Isoard, Lang&eacute;nieux, Meignan, and Foulon, he gave a new impetus to the somewhat remiss administration of his aged predecessor. The Gallicanism of Darboy made him unduly subservient to imperial wishes and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to assume against the exemptions of the religious an attitude which <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1869) compelled him to abandon. It was his chief motive for siding, during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, with the minority which deemed inopportune the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, his reasons being more of a political than of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> nature. Darboy was one of those who suggested diplomatic intervention as a means of ending difficulties. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the final vote of 18 July, 1870, and expressed sentiments which, however, he generously retracted when, several months after the definition, he subscribed to it. During the siege of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Darboy showed himself a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and won the admiration of all. Arrested 4 April, 1871, by order of the Commune, and confined to Mazas Prison, the best efforts of his friends failed to save him; he was shot at Roquette, 24 May, and died blessing his executioners. As soon as order could be restored a national funeral was celebrated for him and the other <a href="../cathen/04168a.htm">victims of the Commune</a>. The Abb&eacute; Perraud delivered his eulogy at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04782a.htm">P&egrave;re Didon</a> at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>. Darboy was the author of the following works: "OEuvres de saint Denys l'Ar&eacute;opagite, traduites du grec" (Paris, 1845); "Les femmes de la Bible" (Paris, 1846-9); Les saintes femmes" (Paris, 1850); "Lettres &agrave; Combalot" (Paris, 1851); "J&eacute;rusalem et la terre sainte" (Paris, 1852); "L'imitation de J&eacute;sus-Christ, traduction nouvelle" (Paris, 1852); "Statistique religieuse du dioc&egrave;se de Paris" (Paris, 1856); "Saint Thomas Becket" (Paris, 1858). He also contributed to the "Correspondant" (1847-1855) and was for a year (1850) director of the "Moniteur Catholique". His pastoral works (2 vols., Paris, 1876) were edited by his biographer, Foulon.
