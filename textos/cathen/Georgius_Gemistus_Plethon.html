<h1>Georgius Gemistus Plethon</h1>  

<p>Born in Constantinople about 1355, died in the Peloponnesus, 1450. Out of veneration for <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> he changed his name from Gemistos to Plethon. Although he wrote commentaries on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises and on Porphyry's "Isagoge", he was a professed <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Owing, most probably, to the influence of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> teachers, he combined with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>, or rather with <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a>, the most extraordinary kind of Oriental <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> and magic which he designated as <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>. It was due, no doubt, to these tendencies of thought that he openly abandoned <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and sought to substitute <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> for it as a standard of life. When he was about fifteen years old he visited Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the train of the Emperor John Palaeologus. After his return to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, he settled at Misithra in the Peloponnesus, the site of ancient <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a>, and there he spent the greater part of his life. In 1438, although he was then in his eighty-third year, he again accompanied the Emperor to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he was designated as one of the six champions of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>. His interest in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters was, however, very slight. Instead of attending the Council, he spent his time discoursing on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> and <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a> to the Florentines. It was his enthusiasm for <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> that influenced Cosimo de Medici to found a Platonic Academy at Florence. In 1441 Plethon had returned to the Peloponnesus, and there he died and was buried at Misithra in 1450. In 1465 his remains were carried to <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and placed in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Francis, where an inscription, curiously enough, styles him "Themistius Byzantinus". Among his disciples was the learned <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a>. Plethon's most important works are the "Laws" written in imitation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Laws", which was condemned by <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Gennadios</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and "On the Differences between Plato and Aristotle", in which he attacks the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> philosophy and asserts the superiority of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>. He also composed a work in defence of the Greek <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Procession of the Holy Ghost. In his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system he borrows largely from the Neo-Platonist, Proclus, and mingles with the traditional <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> many popular Oriental <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>. His influence was chiefly negative. His attack on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelianism</a> was to some extent effective, although opposed to him were men of equal ability and power, such as <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Gennadios</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. He was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the Italian <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> as the restorer of the Academy, and as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the cause of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The <em>Laws</em>, written about 1440, was printed at Paris, 1541 and (in Latin tr.) at Basle, 1574. The comparison of Plato and Aristotle was also printed at Basle, 1574. MIGNE, <em>P.G.,</em> CLX, 773 sqq., reprints these and other Greek works of Plethon, with Latin tr. The best work on Plethon is a dissertation by FRITZ SCHULTZE, <em>Georgios Gemistos Plethon</em> (Jena, 1871).
