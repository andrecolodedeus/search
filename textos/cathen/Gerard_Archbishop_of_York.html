<h1>Gerard, Archbishop of York</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; died at Southwell, 21 May, 1108. He was a nephew of Walkelin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, of Simon, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, and connected with the royal family. Originally a <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> in Rouen <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he became clerk in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of William Rufus, who employed him in 1095 on a diplomatic mission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His success was rewarded with the <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Bishopric of Hereford</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> 8 June, 1096, having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on the previous day. On the accession of Henry I, in 100, he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> and began a long contest with <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, in which he claimed equal primacy with Canterbury and refused to make his profession of canonical obedience before him. When he journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, he was entrusted with the mission of representing the king against Anselm in the controversy about investitures. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> decision was against the king, but Gerard professed to have received private assurances that the decrees would not be enforced. This was denied by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who represented <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, when appealed to, repudiated the statement and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Gerard till he confessed his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and made satisfaction.

<p>Eventually he professed obedience to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, but continued to assert the independence of York. When Anselm refused to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, two of whom had received investiture from the king, Gerard attempted to do so, but two refused to accept <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> at his hands. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reprimanded him for his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, and finally the two <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were reconciled. Gerard carried out many reforms in <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, though by his action against <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> he incurred great unpopularity, and the writers of the time charge him with immorality, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and the practice of magic. He died suddenly on the way to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to attend a council, and his death without <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was regarded as a Divine judgment. The canons refused to bury him within the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the people pelted the hearse with stones. Some Latin verses by him are preserved in the British Museum (Titus. D. XXIV. 3).
