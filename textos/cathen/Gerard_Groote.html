<h1>Gerard Groote</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> Geert De Groote; Gerhardus Magnus.)

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">"Brethren of the Common Life"</a>, b. 1340 at Deventer, Gelderland; d. 20 Aug., 1384. From the chapter <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in his native town Geert went for higher studies first to <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, then to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> he studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and canon law. He returned home, barely eighteen years old. In 1362 he was appointed teacher at the Deventer chapter <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. A few years later his admiring countrymen sent him to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> on a secret mission to <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Pope Urban V</a>. Soon after we find him in Cologne teaching philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, enjoying two <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> and ample means. Warnings of the vanity and danger of this life he heeded not until he met his fellow-student of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, Henry &AElig;ger of Calcar, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Chartreuse of Munnikhuizen near Arnheim. Geert stripped himself at once of honours, <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, and possessions and entered seriously upon the practice of devout life. At this time he also frequently visited the famous ascetic <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Ruysbroek</a>, and no doubt by the advice of this man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he withdrew into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Munnikhuizen, where he spent three years in recollection and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. From his retreat he issued burning with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>. He had received the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> and licence to preach in the Diocese of Utrecht wherever he wished. Young men especially flocked to him in great numbers. Some of these he sent to his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, others he occupied at transcribing good books, to all he taught thorough <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. <a href="../cathen/12631b.htm">Florence Radewyns</a>, his favourite disciple, asked him one day: "Master, why not put our efforts and earnings together, why not work and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> together under the guidance of our Common Father?" In perfect accord both set to work and founded at Zwolle the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">"Brethren of the Common Life"</a>.

<p>His fearless attacks on vice, which spared neither <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> nor <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, developed considerable opposition, which culminated in the withdrawal of his licence to preach. He submitted to episcopal authority, but applied to the Soveregin Pontiff for redress. Henceforth his communities, which were spreading rapidly through the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, Lower <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, claimed and received all his attention. He contemplated organizing his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> into a community of canons regular, but it was left to <a href="../cathen/12631b.htm">Radewyns</a>, his successor, to realize this plan at <a href="../cathen/15651a.htm">Windesheim</a> two years later. Before the answer to his petition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> arrived, Geert De Groote died from pestilence, contracted in ministering to the sick. Groote was the first successful practical mystic, who worked and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and taught others to do the same. He did much for literature in general, for the spread of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and for the development of the vernacular in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Of his biographies the "Vita Gerardi" of <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a> still remains the best.
