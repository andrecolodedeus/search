<h1>Gerard Manley Hopkins</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and poet, born at Stratford, near <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 28 July, 1844; died at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 8 June, 1889.

<p>His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at Cholmondeley School, Highgate, where he gave evidence of fine intellectual endowments, scholarly tastes, and poetical gifts above the ordinary. The numerous <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a> from <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the middle of the nineteenth century together with the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> were not without their effect on the young student, and in October, 1866, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the following year he entered Balliol College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>, having been prepared for his classical course by Walter Pater. Very soon his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a> manifested itself and he left the university, going to the Birmingham Oratory, where he spent a short time with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Father Newman</a>. In 1868 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. After <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was sent to <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a> where his work lay among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> of the slums of that city. His next post was that of preacher in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, after which he was stationed at St. Aloysius' Church, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>, where the Baron and Baroness de Paravicini have erected a memorial to him. In 1884 he was elected fellow of the Royal University of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and appointed classical examiner at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, where he died of a contagious fever.

<p>While still at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he had written verses of distinctive merit but in his ardour as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> he destroyed his poems, a single fragment surviving, and he wrote no more for nearly ten years. The poetry which he subsequently wrote at various periods until the year of his death is of a very high quality. It resembles the poetry of <a href="../cathen/04467a.htm">Crashaw</a> in its exuberance of language, its lyric qualities, and its daring metaphors. The poems have never been collected, but many of them have been published in various anthologies such as Beeching's "Lyra Sacra" and Miles' "Poets and Poetry of the Century".
