<h1>Gerardus Odonis</h1>  

<p>Also <em>Geraldus Othonis</em>, or <em>Ottonis</em>, a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and Minister General of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>; born probably at Ch&acirc;teauroux, in the present department of Indre, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; died at <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, 1348. Whether he was the son of Count Andr&eacute; de Chauvigny is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. After he had entered the Order of St. Francis, most probably at Ch&acirc;t3auroux, and consequently had belonged to the Touraine province of the order, he became a member of the Aquitanian province and still belonged to this latter (without, however, being provincial minister) when he was elected minister general of the order, 10 June, 1329, at the general chapter. The presiding officer of this chapter was Cardinal de la Tour, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34) had appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the order. The previous minister general, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, had been deposed by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> on 6 June, 1328, on account of his rebellious attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the discussion regarding the rule of poverty (see Fraticelli and <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>). Gerardus Odonis was inclined to give up poverty, the principle of the order, on account of which <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> had come into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The general chapter held at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1329) took a position, in the name of the entire order, on the side of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and formally expelled the small party made up of <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena's</a> adherents which opposed the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Gerardus Odonis openly showed his readiness to abandon the rule of poverty at the general chapter of Perpignan (1331), where he won over to his side fourteen provincial <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. In reference to this question they presented a petition to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> rejected in the consistory of 1 August, 1331. Owing to his lax views concerning poverty Gerardus also became entangled in a dispute with King Robert and Queen Sanzia of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. These rulers were unwavering protectors of the rigid adherents to the rule of poverty as well as of the followers of <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> and of the Fraticelli. Notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> of admonition and the fact that <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> sent Gerardus Odonis as his representative to the Court of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1331 and the following year, Gerardus had new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> drawn up with the view of changing the form of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> to that of the old orders of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. These regulations were confirmed, 28 November, 1336, by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (1334-42); consequently Gerardus was able at the chapter held at <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, 7 June, 1337, to obtain, in spite of strong opposition, the enactment of the so-called "Constitutiones Benedictinae". Nevertheless, he was in danger of being removed from his position, nor did the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> remain in force longer that the lifetime of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> and the period during which Gerardus was general. The general chapter of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> abrogated, 1 June, 1343, the "Constitutiones Benedictinae" and re-enacted, with some additions, the constitutions of Narbonne (1260).

<p>There is some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the assertion made as to Gerardus Odonis that he both resembled and imitated Brother Elias, the lax minister general second in succession from <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>; indeed, he even exceeded Elias. However, it must be said to his credit that, in union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> promoted <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missions, constantly sending fresh missionaries to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> (1329); Malabar (1330), <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Tatary (1331); Bosnia (1340). In 1329 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> sent him to King Charles Robert of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and to Ban Stephen of Bosnia for the purpose of bringing about the extermination of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, largely Patarenes, in these countries. On 5 Sept., 1333, Gerardus and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Arnauld de Saint-Michel (Arnauldus de S. Michaele) were appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> to make peace between the Kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the Scotch king in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> having reported, however, that his master was not to be found in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, John recalled the commission of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, 31 Oct., 1333. Gerardus remained in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and defended before a large number of professors of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, on 18 Dec., 1333, the opinion of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> concerning the <em>Visio beatifica</em>, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not enjoy the complete <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a> until after the Last Judgment. The <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> was greatly agitated by the controversy, and the next day, 19 Dec., Philip VI called together twenty-nine professors at Vincennes to discuss the question. This assembly dissented from the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as did also a second assembly which met 2 Jan., 1334. As is known, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> withdrew his opinion, 3 Dec., 1334. Gerardus Odonis was also one of the commission of sixteen masters of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which met by command of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> from 4 July to 4 Sept., 1334, at Pont-Sorgues near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, to discuss, under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> presidency, the question of the <em>Visio beatifica</em>. On 27 Nov., 1342, <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and at the same time administrator of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.

<p>Apart from the "Constitutiones Benedictinae" and the "Officium de stigmatibus S. Francisci", still recited in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> and commonly attributed to Gerardus, the best known of his writings is his "Commentarius [Expositio] in Aristotelis Ethicam" (Brescia, 1482, Venice, 1500). This work brought him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> later of being called <em>Doctor Moralis</em>. He also wrote on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and a treatise entitled "Philosophia Naturalis", in which he is said to have apparently taught <a href="../cathen/02053a.htm">Atomism</a>; another work was a "Commentarius in IV libros Sententiarum". Among his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works are: "De figuris Bibliorum", and treatises on the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and the Epistle to the Galatians, besides "Sermones". In addition to taking severe measures against the adherents of the deposed <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, Gerardus addressed to the latter the writing "Quid niteris", to which, however, Cesena soon made a rejoinder beginning "Teste Salomone".
