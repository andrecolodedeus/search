<h1>Gerhoh of Reichersberg</h1>  

<p>Provost of that place and <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canon</a>, one of the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the twelfth century, b. at Polling, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 1093; d. at Reichersberg, 27 June, 1169. He studied at Freising, Mosburg, and <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. In 1119, Bishop Hermann of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> called him as "scholasticus" to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of that city; shortly afterwards, though still a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he made him a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Gradually Gerhoh adopted a stricter <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> attitude, and eventually withdrew (1121) from the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> Bishop Hermann, and took refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Raitenbuch in the Diocese of Freising. After the Concordat of Worms (1122) Bishop Hermann was reconciled with the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, whereupon Gerhoh accompanied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the Lateran Council of 1123. On his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Gerhoh resigned his canonicate, and with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and two half-brothers joined the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canons</a> at Raitenbuch (1124).

<p>Bishop Kuno of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1126, and gave him the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Cham, which he later resigned under threats from Hohenstaufen followers whom he had offended at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in 1127. He returned to <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and in 1132 Archbishop Conrad I of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Reichersberg, to the spiritual and material advantage of that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Archbishop Conrad sent him several times on special missions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; in 1143 he also accompanied, together with <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, Cardinal Guido of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Porticu on his embassy to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia. <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> (1145-53) held Gerhoh in high esteem; his relations with the successors of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were less pleasant. On the occasion of the disputed papal election in 1159 (<a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>) Gerhoh sided with <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, but only after long hesitation; for this action the imperial party looked on him with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. For refusing to support the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Archbishop Conrad was condemned to banishment in 1166, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Reichersberg repeatedly attacked; Gerhoh himself was forced to take refuge in flight, and died soon after his return to Reichersberg. Gerhoh was a reformer in the spirit of the Gregorian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. He aimed particularly, perhaps with excessive <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, at the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; it seemed to him that this object could not be attained unless the community life were generally adopted.

<p>His reformatory views, and his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy are set forth in the following works : "De &aelig;dificio Dei seu de studio et cura disciplin&aelig; ecclesiastic&aelig;" (P.L., CXCIV, 1187-1336; Sackur, 136-202); "Tractatus adversus Simoniacos" (P.L., 1335-1372; Sackur, 239-272; see also Jaksch in Mittheilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichtsforschung, VI [1885], 254-69); "Liber epistolaris ad Innocentium II. Pont. Max. de eo quis distet inter clericos s&aelig;culares et regulares" (P.L., CXCIV, 1375-1420; Sackur, 202-239); "De novitatibus hujus s&aelig;culi ad Adrianum IV Papam" (selections in Grisar and in Sackur, 288-304); furthermore, the important work written in 1162, "De investigatione Anti-Christi" libri III [selections in P.L., CXCIV, 1443-1480; see also St&uuml;lz in "Archiv f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichte, XXII (1858), 127-188; selections in Scheibelberger, see below; book I complete in Sackur, 304-395]; "De schismate ad cardinales" [<a href="../cathen/10625b.htm">M&uuml;hlbacher</a> in Archiv f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichte, XLVII (1871), 355-382; Sackur, 399-411]; his last work is the "De quarta vigilia noctis" [Oesterreichische Vierteljahresschrift f&uuml;r kath. Theologie X (1871), 565-606; Sackur, 503-525]. His principal work he left unfinished, "Commentarius in Psalmos" (P.L., CXCIII, 619-1814; CXCIV, 1-1066); it offers much interesting material for contemporaneous history. This is particularly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of his commentary on <a href="../bible/psa064.htm">Psalm 64</a>, that appeared separately as "Liber de corrupto Ecclesi&aelig; statu ad Eugenium III Papam" (P.L., CXCIV, 9-120); Sackur, 439-92). We are indebted to him also for a number of polemical works and letters against the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e, and Bishop Eberhard of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>; others deal with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Folmar, Provost of Triefenstein, on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>.

<p>The genuineness of the "Vit&aelig; beatorum abbatum Formbacensium Berengeri et Wirntonis, O.S.B.", generally ascribed to Gerhoh, is denied by Wattenbach. The <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> edition of Gerhoh's works is faulty and incomplete. Those of his writings which are of importance for the study of the history of that period were edited by Sackur in the "Monumenta Germani&aelig; Historica: Libelli de lite imperatorum et pontificum", III (Hanover, 1897), 131-525; also by Scheibelberger, "Gerhohi Opera adhuc inedita" (Linz, 1875).
