<h1>German Roman Catholic Central Verein of North America</h1>  

<p>(Deutscher r&ouml;misch-katholischer Centralverein von Nordamerika)</p>

<p>The origin of the Central Verein dates back to 1854, in which year the presidents of three German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> benevolent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, new York, issued a call to various German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for the purpose for forming a central body. The movement was inspired and advocated by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and approved by Bishop Timon of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>. The success of a similar organization among their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> brethren in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (founded at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1848), lent additional force to the arguments for a union in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The call was responded to by seventeen <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and on 15 April, 1855, the Central Verein was duly organized in St. Alphonsus Hall, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The main object at the outset was to unite the energies of the various associations against <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemasonry</a> and <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> in general. Hence the efforts of the new organization were directed chiefly towards defending the menaced <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as also "to promote a vigorous religious activity in the united <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> according to the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> and mutually to aid and materially to benefit one another". Membership was restricted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> benevolent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> whose official language was German. The growth by decades was as follows:

<ul> <li>1855 &mdash; 17 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (1,500 members) <li>1865 &mdash; 62 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (8,340 members) <li>1875 &mdash; 302 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (31,672 members) <li>1885 &mdash; 378 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (32,783 members) <li>1895 &mdash; 548 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (48,989 members) </ul>

<p>From the last named date, however, the growth became less marked, and in 1901 a reorganization movement was inaugurated. Instead of affiliating local <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> as heretofore, the formation of state organizations was encouraged, and these so-called "Staatsverb&auml;nde" were then incorporated as a whole, the various local <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> losing their direct affiliation to the Central Verein. This plan <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a complete success. In 1907 the report of the secretary showed sixteen state organizations and fifty-two local <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> from states in which no "Staatsverband" existed, with a total paid-up membership of 99,291. The unreported membership would bring this total far beyond 100,000. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> approved the work of the Central Verein in a reply to a letter of allegiance sent by the eleventh general convention held at <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, 1866, to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>. The reply praises the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity prevailing among the members and wishes them success and the ever copious assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. It gratefully acknowledges and appreciates the contributions the Central Verein had gathered for the support of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. During fifty-two years the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> contributed about $12,000 to the <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a> collection.

<p>The care of the immigrants was made a prominent feature of the work of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and special agents were appointed to look after their interests in New York and <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Later on the Central Verein was affiliated to the St. Raphael's Society. The result of their combined efforts was the establishment in New York of the Leo House for the use of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants. Aid was extended to a similar undertaking at <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. The cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has a conspicuous advocates in the Central Verein. The Teachers' Seminary at St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, was founded mainly by contributions from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. In his address to the delegates assembled in <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, 1907, Archbishop Falconio, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, said: "What your <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has done in the interest of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is truly admirable and an example worthy of imitation for all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>". The annual conventions, under the name of "Katholikentage", have assumed large proportions. Extending over four or five days, they include solemn church festivities, parades, addresses by prominent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, business meetings, and social gathering.
