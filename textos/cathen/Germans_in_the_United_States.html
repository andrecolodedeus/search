<h1>Germans in the United States</h1>  

<p>Germans, either by birth or descent, form a very important element in the population of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Their number is estimated at not less than twelve millions. Under the name <em>Germans</em> we here understand to be included all German-speaking people, whether originally from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> proper, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Germans in general</h2>

<p>The landing, in the autumn of 1683, of Franz Daniel Pastorius and his little band of <a href="../cathen/10190b.htm">Mennonite</a> weavers, from Crefeld, marks the beginning of German-American history. These early immigrants founded Germantown, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, where they soon built themselves a church and established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, taught by Pastorius, who wrote for it, and published, a primer, the first original school-book printed in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. To this place came the German settlers who gradually spread over Montgomery, Lancaster, and Berks Counties, among them, the so-called <a href="../cathen/13193b.htm">Rosicrucians</a> (settled near Germantown), a colony of German Friends, <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quaker</a> converts made by William Ames and visited by Penn (founded Cresheim, from Kreigsheim near Worms), and the <a href="../cathen/15090b.htm">Dunkers</a> (Conestoga, Aphrata). From these early <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> settlers and their descendants many Americans of note have sprung, as Bayard Taylor, James Lick, Charles Yerkes, John Fritz, John Wanamaker, Charles M. Schwab, and Henry C. Frick.

<p>In 1707, a small band of <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutherans</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatinate</a>, embarked for America. They landed at Philadelphia and settled in what is now known as Morris County. In the spring of the following year, another company of fifty-two <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatines</a>, joined by three Holsteiners, went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and appealed to Queen Anne, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for transportation to America. The majority of these men were farmers and one was a <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, Kockerthal; on arriving in the Colonies in the winter of 1709, they were settled in the district then known as Quassaick Creek and Thankskamir (part of the territory of the present Newburgh). Another, and far more extensive, migration took place in the same year and the following; about three thousand <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatines</a> landed in America, by way of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The severities of the winter of 1708-09 seem to have been the chief cause of this exodus. One company, under Christopher de Graffenried and Lewis Mitchell, settled at the junction of the Neuse River and the Trent (<a href="../cathen/11108a.htm">North Carolina</a>) and in the neighbouring country. This colony included a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, and to their first settlement they gave the name, New Berne, in memory of the native city of the two <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> partners, de Graffenried and Mitchell. Another company of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> was settled about the same time, by Governor Spotswood, at Germanna in <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, whither, a little later, many of those who had established themselves in <a href="../cathen/11108a.htm">North Carolina</a> are said to have removed. Some ten or fifteen years after Spotswood's retirement to Germanna, a company of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> came into <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> from <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, doubtless <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatines</a> from Berks County. They settled in the lower Shenandoah Valley and founded the town of Strasburgh, just over the mountain from Germanna.

<p>By far the largest expedition of <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatines</a> left the shores of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> towards the end of January, 1710. They were settled on the Hudson (Rhinebeck, Germantown, Newburgh, West Camp, Saugerties, etc.), whence many afterwards removed to the Schoharie Valley (Blenheim, Oberweiser, Dorp, Brunnen Dorp, etc.); the Government, however, refused to recognize their title to the Schoharie lands, and some of them at last migrated in disgust to the Mohawk Valley, where their increase and the stream of German immigration that followed made the Mohawk "for thirty miles, a German river" (Mannheim, Oppenheim, Newkirk, German Flats, Herkimer, etc.). But the greater portion removed from Schoharie in 1723 to <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, where Governor Keith, on hearing of their afflictions and unrest, offered them an asylum from all <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Previously to this migration from New York to <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, thousands of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> had sailed directly to the latter territory, and so large was the <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatine</a> element in these and the following immigrations that the natives of all other German States, coming with them, were called by the same name. Between 1720 and 1730 the German immigration to <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> became so large as to be looked upon by the other settlers with serious misgivings; Logan, Penn's secretary, suggested the danger of the province becoming a German colony, as the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> "settled together, and formed a distinct people from His Majesty's subjects". As early as 1739, a German newspaper was published at Germantown, and another appeared at Philadelphia in 1743. The Germans became an important factor in the political life of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, usually uniting with the <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a>, and forming with them a conservative peace party. In 1734, the <a href="../cathen/13597a.htm">Schwenkfelders</a>, followers of Casper Schofield, came to <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and settled along the Perkiomen, in Montgomery County. About the same time a number of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> established themselves near Frederick, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and between South Mountain and the Conococheague.

<p>The first German settlement in South Carolina was in 1731, at Purysburg on the Savannah. In 1734 <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutherans</a> from <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> founded Ebenezer, the first settlement in <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>. Seven years later, there were about 1200 Germans in <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>. By the middle of the eighteenth century the mountain counties of <a href="../cathen/11108a.htm">North Carolina</a> had numerous German settlements. Meantime, the Moravians, who in 1736 had settled in <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, had left that colony and secured a tract of land in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, to which they gave the name of Bethlehem. Zinzendorf came thither in 1741. More than twenty years earlier, German settlers had established themselves on the lower Mississippi. The "German Creoles" of Louisiana are descendants of these early colonists.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the Revolution, thirty thousand German soldiers fought under the British flag. They had been sold to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the petty princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, those "brokers of men and sellers of souls", as one of these soldiers rightly styled them. As <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> furnished more than any other German State (twelve thousand) all these soldiers were called <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hessians</a>. Over one third of the thirty thousand never returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; some had died; many had deserted to Washington's army, "coming over in shoals", as Gates wrote in 1777; many thousands settled in the newly created States.



<p>On the eve of the Revolution there were fully a hundred thousand Germans in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Their number was little increased during the next sixty years, since the great immigration period did not begin until about the year 1840. Among those who came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> before 1830 was Franz Lieber, accompanied by his two friends, Professors Carl Beck and Carl Follen. For nearly half a century Lieber stood in the front rank as an authority on public questions. The year 1848 brought to our shores those thousands of political refugees who belonged to the most <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> of the German nation. To mention several, merely as typical of the rest, among these "Forty-Eighters" were Carl Schurz, Friedrich Hecker, Franz Sigel, Oswald Ottendorfer, Friedrich Kapp, Wilhelm Rapp, Gustav von Struve, and Lorenzo Brentano. Soon the number of German immigrants grew enormously, averaging over 800,000 for each of the six succeeding decades. They did not, however, settle in the Eastern States only, but the majority proceeded to the Middle West, whither many of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, who had already been very numerous on the frontiers, had removed as soon as the new country was opened for colonizing. Owing to prosperity in the Fatherland, German immigration began to decline in the early nineties. During the period subsequent to 1848 the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> settled chiefly in the following states: New York, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> (especially the western parts), <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a>, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North Dakota</a>. They were never attracted to the New England States until about the middle of the nineteenth century. Even now <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, and Maine have practically no German population; in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> there are very few except around <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. According to the twelfth census, taken in 1900, there was in that year, a German-born population of 2,663,418 in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (about three millions from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and German <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>). Since 1900 about 250,000 more have come over. Add to these the descendants of the immigrants from the earliest periods down to our time, and the large number of people of German descent who can now hardly be recognized as Germans, owing to the fact that they have assumed English names, it is safe to say that there are at present (1909) fully twelve million <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of German birth or descent in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The early Germans were mostly farmers in their old country, and it was but natural that, after their arrival in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> they should have chosen the same occupation. There is no need of pointing out the merits of the German farmers, since those merits have been generally admitted in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the Mohawk Valley, and, later, the Middle West. In trade, industry, and commerce the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are second to none. Men like Spreckels, Havemeyer, A. Busch, Fred Pabst, Henry Miller, and Henry C. Frick, stand among the pillars of American Industry. Rockefeller is proud of his German descent. The Belmonts came from Alzey, the Astors from Walldorf near <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>, the Iselins from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The largest lumber-yard in the world, is owned by Fritz Weyerh&auml;user, a native of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. The Roeblings are still prominent in their line of industry. Prominent as bankers are those bearing German names.

<p>But more important, thought less known, is the army of skilled mechanics in all different branches, designers, lithographers, etc., who, in their spheres, have made the German name <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> and respected. The Germans are known to be a hardworking, thrifty people, and, as a result, they are generally prosperous, and pauperism is hardly known among them. Americans have learned that wherever the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> settle, prosperity and culture are pretty sure to follow. &#151; "What the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> so, they do well", has become a common saying among their neighbours. <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritanism</a> never gained a foothold among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Though they cannot be charged with extravagance, they are fond of the quiet joys and amusements of social life, witness their many <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, which combine beneficial objects with recreation and amusement. Their fondness for children and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life is well known; as a rule they have large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The industry and carefulness of the German housewife are proverbial.

<p>While there have not been any great political leaders among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, with the exception, perhaps, of Carl Schurz, it cannot be denied that their influence on the political development of the country has been on the whole a very wholesome one. As adherents of a healthy and vigorous conservativism in politics, they are universally respected. Though anxious to preserve their language and customs, they have given ample <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their loyalty to the land of their choice. The share taken by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, was by no means limited to the War of the Revolution and the Civil War of 1861-65. From the very beginning of their settlement in this country, they always stood ready to take up arms in its defence. The early Germans of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and New York, responded freely to the summons to defend their new country against the French and their allies, the Indians. They gave freely of their men and means to the cause of liberty, in the War of the Revolution. The names of Generals de Kalb, F. W. A. Steuben, F. W. de Woedke, J. P.G. Muehlenberg, and George Weedon will always be mentioned with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, among those who established the liberties of the country. Undoubtedly the ablest of them was General Steuben, the impetuous warrior who "took a mob and hammered it into an army". Nor should we forget to cite the name of Herkimer, than whom no braver man fought in the War for Independence. He was the son of a <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatine</a> immigrant, and in the battle of Oriskany &#151; "of all the battles of the Revolution, the most obstinate and murderous" &#151; those whom Herkimer led were largely <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatines</a>. To them and their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> leader belongs largely the credit of making possible the victory of Saratoga, by which the struggle for the Hudson was ended, and the vital union of the northern Colonies secured.

<p>The Germans also did their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in full in the War of 1812 and in the Mexican War. What they did to keep the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> together, can be learned from an article by General Franz Sigel, which was published at <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a> after his death. The General calls attention to the historical fact, that, three days after the surrender of Fort Sumter, when the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">City of Washington</a> was in imminent peril of falling into the hands of the Confederates, this catastrophe was prevented by the arrival of a detachment of infantry and cavalry from <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the five companies of which were chiefly composed of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, both from the older and from the more recent immigrant stock. Again, when <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a> was in extreme danger of falling into the hands of the Confederacy it was four regiments of volunteers, mainly German, and one regiment commanded by Sigel that surrounded the camp of the Confederates and made them <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. There were, during that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, not fewer than 176,767 Germans in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Army. Of the more than 5,000 officers of the German contingent, the following may here be mentioned: the exiled popular leader Friedrich Hecker, who was one of the first to form a volunteer regiment, Gustav von Struve, General Blanker, General Osterhaus, Jos. Fickler, Nepomuk Katzenmayer, General Alexander von Schimmelpfennig, General Max Weber, General Sigel, and Captain Albert Sigel, a brother of the General, August Willich, the commander of a regiment from <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, and especially General Carl Schurz, who commanded the eleventh corps at the battle of Gettysburg. It is deserving of mention that among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, the advocates of the abolition of slavery were always prominent. The first German settlers in this country, were also signers of the first anti-slavery petition in America (1688).

<p>Although the first German colonists themselves, for the most part, had no higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> than what was to be acquired in the German village <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of that time, they considered it their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to establish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for their children, and therefore, as a rule, brought teachers over with them. School attendance was always looked upon as a serious matter, almost as serious as the teaching of religion, which was combines with elementary instruction, so that German colonies thus paved the way for compulsory <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Men like Muehlenberg and Schlatter did much in the way of improving the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The development of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German literature</a> in America, including thousands of publications, went hand in hand with this progress. The first German Bible published in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> appeared in 1743, forty years before an English Bible was printed in America. The "Public Academy of the City of Philadelphia", not the University of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, is the first American <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> into which German was introduced. Gradually the language was introduced into the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of cities with a large German population, and numerous German private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were established in the different parts of the country. And after <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> Americans had become acquainted with German <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> methods, <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German literature</a>, and German <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, either directly by attending German <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of learning, or indirectly from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> through <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, they enthusiastically advocated <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reform based upon the German models. It is no exaggeration to speak of a gradual "Germanization" of most of the greater American colleges. "Although Great Britain is generally regarded as the mother of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has, from an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> standpoint, become more and more the second mother of the American Republic. More than any other country, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has made the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and colleges of America what they are today &#151; a powerful force in the development of American Civilization" (Andrew D. White).
<h2 id="section2">The German Catholics in America</h2>

<p>A certain proportion of the <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatines</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but they were not allowed to proceed to the American colonies, neither was the English government willing to permit their prolonged residence in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. They were therefore returned under government passports to the <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatinate</a>. But of those who came later and directly to America, undoubtedly, a considerable number were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. in 1741 the German Province of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, sent out two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to minister to the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. These were Father William Wappelet (born 22 January, 1711, in the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Diocese of Mainz</a>), co-founder of the mission of Conewago, and Father Theodore Schneider, a <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatine</a> (born at Geinsheim, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Diocese of Speyer</a>, 7 April, 1703), who took up his residence at Goshenhoppen, in Berks County. Other German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> came later on, among them Fathers James Frambach (died 1795 at Conewago), Luke Geissler (died at Lancaster, in 1786), Lawrence Graessel, who was appointed coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll</a>, but died in Philadelphia, of yellow fever, before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, James Pellentz, one of <a href="../cathen/03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll's</a> vicars-general (died at Conewago in 1800), Matthias Sittensperger (changed his name to Manners), <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Ferdinand Steinmayr (Farmer)</a>, who, according to <a href="../cathen/03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll</a>, founded the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation in New York (died in Philadelphia, 17 August, 1787, in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>). <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Father Farmer</a> was a member of the famous Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, and was made a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Philadelphia, when that institution was chartered in 1779. To these early missionaries may be added Father John Baptist de Ritter, who was a German, though a member of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Province. He died at Goshenhoppen, 3 February, 1787. Father Schneider was the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Goshenhoppen for twenty-three years, ministering to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there and in the region for fifty miles around. Before he died, in 1764, he had the satisfaction of seeing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> firmly established in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. His companion, Father Wappeler, founded the mission of the Sacred Heart at Conewago. Of him, <a href="../cathen/03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll</a> wrote that "he was a man of much learning and unbounded <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>". Having remained about eight years in America, and converted or reclaimed many to the Faith of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he was forced by bad health to return to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. His successor, Father Pellentz, built the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the first in the country under that title. it is not probable that there was any large, or indeed appreciable, number of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in any other colony at that time, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, whose French inhabitants shared and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> their religion, whereas most of the English colonies had severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the "Papists". But gradually all were opened to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>From a letter by the Rev. Dr. Carroll to the <a href="../cathen/12167a.htm">Rev. C. Plowden</a>, in 1785, we learn that in that year he visited Philadelphia, New York, and the upper countries of the Jerseys and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, "where our worthy German brethren have formed congregations". Although we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of any German settlement in the Far West during the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries, we find during that period German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> labouring among the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> on the coast of the Pacific, and in the south-western States. The first German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on the Pacific coast was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Father <a href="../cathen/08660a.htm">Eusebio Francisco Kino</a>. His real name was <a href="../cathen/08660a.htm">Eusebius Franz Kuehn</a>. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. He came from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1680 or 1681, and to <a href="../cathen/03177a.htm">Lower California</a> in 1683. In the following year he was called to <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a>, where he laboured until his death, in 1710, meanwhile making missionary and exploring trips to the Rio Gila in <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a>. Other German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/03177a.htm">Lower California</a> from 1719 to 1767, were <a href="../cathen/02201b.htm">Joseph Baegert</a>, the author of the "Nachrichten von der Kalifornischen Halbinsel" (Mannheim, 1772), Joh. Bischoff, <a href="../cathen/05183c.htm">Franz Benno Ducure</a>, Joseph Gasteiger, Eberhard Helen, Lambert Hostell, Wenzeslaus Link, Karl Neumayr, Georg Retz, Ignatz Tuersch, Franz X. Wagner. <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a> saw the indefatigable <a href="../cathen/08660a.htm">Father Eusebius Kuehn</a>, towards the latter part of the seventeenth century, as far up as the Gila River at its junction with the Colorado. In 1731, Philip V, at the suggestion of Benedict Crespo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Durango</a>, ordered three central missions to be established in <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>, at the royal expense. To the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, three German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Fathers were sent, Father Ignatius Xavier Keller, Father John Baptist Grashoffer, and Father Philip Segesser. Of the last two, one soon died, and the other was prostrated by sickness, but Father Ignatius Keller became the leader of the new missions in that district, taking possession of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Soamea, 20 April, 1732. About the year 1750, we find Father Ignatius Pfefferkorn, a native of Mannheim, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, at Guevavi; and at the same time, Father Sedelmayr, at the instance of the Spanish Government, was evangelizing the tribes of the Gila, erecting seven or eight churches in the villages of the Papagos, among whom Father Bernard Middendorf also laboured, and Father Keller was endeavouring to reach the Moquis, who were willing to receive missionaries of any kind but <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Other prominent <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from the Fatherland were Fathers Caspar Steiger, Heinrich K&uuml;rtzel, and Michael Gerstner. By the summary act of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1763, every church in <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a> was closed and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians were deprived of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>In 1808, the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Diocese of Baltimore</a>, which had, up to this time, embraced the entire <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, was divided, and the four new sees of Philadelphia, New York, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and Bardstown erected. There were, at that time, under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, attended by the Rev. William Elling and Father Adam Britt, the latter of whom issued a new edition of the German <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>; St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum, erected in 1806, was the first institution of its kind established by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Rev. Louis de Barth attended at Lancaster and Conewago. He was the son of Joseph de Barth, Count de Welbach, and his wife, Maria Louisa de Rohme, and was born at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, 1 November, 1764. When the See of Philadelphia became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> by the death of Bishop Egan, Father de Barth became administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He died 13 October, 1838. The Rev. Paul Erntzen had begun, in 1793, his quarter-century pastorship at Goshenhoppen. Father Peter Helbron, O. Min. Cap., had reared a log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Westmoreland County. After years of devoted service, he went to Philadelphia, but died at <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a> on his homeward journey. The <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Rev. Demetrius A. Gallitzin</a> was labouring in the district of which Loretto was the centre, and had come to America in 1792, with a learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Rev. F. K.  Brosius, who had offered his services to Dr. Carroll. He travelled under the name of Schmet, a contraction of his mother's name, but this in America soon became Smith, by which he was known for many years. He bore letters to <a href="../cathen/03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll</a>, and when he was introduced to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Saint-Sulpice</a>, was delighted with their life and work. His father had marked out a brilliant career for him in the military or diplomatic service in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but the peace and simplicity which reigned in America contrasted to forcibly with the seething maelstrom of <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">European revolution</a> that, penetrated with the vanity of worldly grandeur, young <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Gallitzin</a> resolved to renounce all schemes of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, and to embrace the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> profession for the benefit of the American mission.

<p>In 1808 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of New York was created, and its chief organizer was the learned and able <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Father, <a href="../cathen/08686c.htm">Anthony Kohlmann</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and administrator <em>sede vacante</em>. He had come over from the old country in 1806, together with two other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of his order. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in New York had gradually increased, so that they organized a little congregation by themselves. Their first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> seems to have been the Rev. John Raffeiner, of whom <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Archbishop Hughes</a> said: "Bishops, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and people have reason to remember Father Raffeiner for many years to come". He visited his countrymen far and near, always ready to hasten to any point to give them the consolations of religion. For a time the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in New York assembled under his care in a disused <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist</a> place of worship at the corner of Delancey and Pitt Streets, and afterwards, when the lease expired, in St. Mary's church; but on 20 April, 1833, the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of a church to be dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a>, on Second Street, was laid. By the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and exertions of Father Raffeiner the church was completed and dedicated on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 1836. Father Raffeiner directed the church for several years and became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the diocese. By the year 1836, the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> element in the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> diocese required Bishop Fenwick's care, the largest body of them being in and near Roxbury. Having no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> who could speak German fluently, Bishop Fenwick applied to his fellow-bishop in New York, and at the close of May, 1835, the Very Rev. John Raffeiner, apostle of his countrymen in the East, arrived. On the last day of May, that <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> gathered three hundred in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Aloysius and addressed them with so much power and unction, that he spent the whole evening in the confessional. Quickened by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, they resolved to collect means to support a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in August, 1836, they obtained the Rev. Father Hoffmann as their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, with Father Freygang as assistant; but, led by designing men, they would not co-operate with those sent to minister to them. Fathers Hoffmann and Freygang were both forced to retire, and an ex-Benedictine, named Smolnikar, became their choice. In a short time, however, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> discovered in this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> unmistakable signs of insanity and, unable to obtain another <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, became himself the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the German congregation. In 1841, stimulated by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, they purchased a lot on Suffolk Street, and prepared to erect a church, laying the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> on 28 June; he had already secured a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Rev. F Roloff, for his congregation. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body in New York City, was now increasing so rapidly that soon another church was needed, and in June the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of St. John Baptist's was laid by the Very Rev. Dr. Power, to be dedicated on 13 September, by the <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Rt. Rev. Dr. Hughes</a>.

<p>About 1820 <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> was already the home of many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of German speech. it was for this reason that Bishop Flaget, of Bardstown and <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, urged that a see should be erected at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and for its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> recommended the <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Rev. Demetrius A. Gallitzin</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and familiar with the language and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the people; but the good <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, learning of the project, peremptorily refused. In 1829, two <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> began to make a list of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countrymen in the <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>. They found them everywhere &#151; at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, Somerset, Lancaster &#151; and by their untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> awoke in the hearts of many who had for years neglected to practise it. One of these itinerant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was the Rev. John Martin Henni, a name to be known in time as that of the founder of the first German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>. In 1832, on the death of Bishop Fenwick of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> devolved on the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/16052a.htm">Father Edward Reese</a>, who had laboured so earnestly among his countrymen in the diocese and been instrumental in the establishment of the "Leopoldinen-Stiftung", an association for aiding missions, at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> have fostered so many missions and helped substantially towards developing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system, particularly in the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> formed from it. Dr. Reese was born at Vianenburg, near <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, in 1791 and, like Pio Nono, had been a cavalry officer before he embraced the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. he was the founder of the Athen&aelig;um in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, which later was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and changed into the present St. Xavier College. <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, erected in 1834, was the first German church west of the Alleghanies. Its second <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the Rev. John M. Henni, whom we have already mentioned, displaying untiring energy in founding and organizing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and was actively interested in the development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work throughout the States; he also formed the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Orphan Society of St. Aloysius, and an asylum was soon erected. About this time, log churches arose at Glandorf, <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and New Riegel in northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, sufficient to gather the faithful together, and afforded a place for the instruction of the young. Meanwhile, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the State increased steadily, and the churches and institutions were very inadequate. St. Mary's church for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, was dedicated in July, 1842; another German church was erected about the same time, as Zanesville, by Rev. H. D.  Juncker. As early as 1836, a German congregation was organized at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, by the Rev. Jos. Stahlschmidt; they soon erected St. Boniface's church, which was dedicated on the feast of All Saints, 1838. This church was attended for a time from <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> and <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> by the Rev. Jos. Ferneding and Rev. John M. Henni. In 1842, on 30 October, Bishop Chabrat dedicated St. Mary's church, <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, a fine brick structure, erected by the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of that city. When, in 1833, the Rt. Rev. Frederick Reese became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, there were labouring in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, among other German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorist</a> Fathers Saenderl and Hatscher. in the following year the German church of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> was established. At that time Vincennes was erected into a diocese. Three years later, we find a German congregation in Jasper County, Illinois. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> around Quincy, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, had erected a house for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and as a temporary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> till their church was built. Father Charles Meyer's ministrations in the little log <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Andrew, at <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, Ill., was his first step to a future <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. In 1841, a German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church was erected at West Point, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, in the present <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Diocese of Dubuque</a>. At Pittsburg the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> attended St. Patrick's until their increasing numbers made it expedient for them to form a separate congregation. They then worshipped in a building previously used as a factory. in 1839, at <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick's</a> suggestion, a community of <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorists</a> then in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, came and took charge of this mission, and the factory was soon transformed into the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Philomena, with a <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> attached &#151; the first house of that congregation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Here, before long, the Rev. John N. Neumann received the habit and began his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, to become in time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, and die in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. When, on 3 December, 1843, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> reached that city, he founded in his district a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population estimated at forty-five thousand, 12,000 being of German origin.

<p>An attempt at <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonization was made about this time at St. Mary's, Elk County, where Messrs. Mathias <a href="../cathen/02484b.htm">Benziger</a> and J. Eschbach, of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, purchased a large tract. Settlers soon gathered from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who, from the first, were attended by the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorist</a> Fathers, but, though well managed, and encouraged by the hearty approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the town never attained any considerable size. Important and wide-reaching in its results, not only for the Diocese of Pittsburg, but for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was the arrival at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, 30 September, 1845, of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Dom Boniface Wimmer</a>. The Rev. Peter Lemcke, a German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, had been labouring for several years in the mission of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. His life had been a strange and varied one. Born in <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he grew up attached to their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, trained piously by those who clung to the great doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Drafted into the army, he fought under Bl&uuml;cher at Waterloo, and afterwards returning to his home, resolved to become a <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheran</a> minister. To his astonishment and dismay, he found the professors to be men who, in their classes, ridiculed every religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> which he had been taught to prize. He was led to study, and a thorough mastery of the works of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> convinced him that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> never could have chosen such a man to work any good in his Church. he went to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, where he began to study <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a>, and was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/13328a.htm">Bishop Sailer</a>. Having resolved to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he went through a course of study and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. Coming to America in 1834, he was sent, in time, as assistant to Father <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Gallitzin</a>, and laboured in the missions of Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. As early as 1835, he appealed, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> to come to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1844, mainly to obtain German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the missions of the Diocese of Pittsburg. At <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> he met <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Dom Boniface Wimmer</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the ancient Abbey of Metten, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, a religious whose thoughts have already turned to the American mission. Father Lemcke offered him a farm of 400 acres which he owned at Carrolltown, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Correspondence with Bishop O'Connor followed. <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Dom Boniface</a> could not secure any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of his order, but he obtained four students and fourteen <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. Their project was liberally aided by the Ludwig-Verein, the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, and others. After conducting his colony to Carrolltown, <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Father Wimmer</a> paid his respects to Bishop O'Connor. That <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> urged him to accept the estate at St. Vincent's which <a href="../cathen/02803b.htm">Father Brouwers</a> had left to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the preceding century, rather than establish his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Carroltown. Visiting St. Vincent's with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Dom Boniface</a> found there a brick church with a two-story brick house which, though built for a pastoral residence, had been an academy of <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. He decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> suggestion, and, 19 October, 1846, the first community of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was organized in the schoolhouse at St. Vincent's. <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Father Wimmer</a> took charge of the neighboring congregation, and was soon attending several stations. His students were gradually <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and in a few years St. Vincent's was declared by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> an independent <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, and was duly incorporated 10 May, 1853. <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Prior Wimmer</a> showed great ability and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and from the outset confined his labours as much as possible to German congregations.

<p>Already, before 1850, the Rev. John E. Paulhuber and other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Fathers from <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a> had been in charge of St. Mary's church at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, erected for Germans, of whom there were seven or eight hundred in the city. In the <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Diocese of Wheeling</a>, erected in 1850, there was a log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> near the German settlement of Kingwood. About that time, German settlers were gathering in Preston, Doddridge, and Marshall Counties. Soon after, the Rev. F Mosblech began to plan the erection of a church for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>. When <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Bishop Hughes</a>, in 1843, returned from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, one of his first episcopal acts was the dedication of the church of the Most Holy Redeemer, on Third Street, New York, which the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorists</a> had erected for the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The Rev. John Raffeiner, the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, reported the labours among his countrymen, in New York State, of Fathers Schneider at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, Schwenninger at <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, Inama at Salina, the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorists</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of St. Peter's church at Rochester, and announced that peace prevailed in the long distracted congregation of <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>. In New York City, St. Alphonsus, the second church of the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorists</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, was erected in 1848. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, though struggling with difficulties, were soon rearing a near Gothing church on Hamilton and Philip Streets. Addressing the Leopold Society, in January, 1850, to acknowledge their generous aid, <a href="../cathen/09488a.htm">Bishop McCloskey</a> estimated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at 70,000, including 10,000 Germans. He had sixty-two churches, eleven of them for Germans. At about the same time, Bishop Timon, of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, estimated his flock at 40,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, half of whome were Germans, attended by five <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and five <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorists</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a> received, in 1843, a valuable accession, a colony of seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12373c.htm">Congregation of the Most Precious Blood</a> (Sanguinists), led by the <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Rev. Francis de Sales Brunner</a>. The difficult mission of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> was assigned to them by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with the charge of Norwalk and scattered stations in the neighbouring counties. The labours of the Sanguinist <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were singally blessed, and the healthy growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that part of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> must be ascribed mainly to these excellent missioners. In December, 1844, <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Father Brunner</a> established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of his congregation at New Riegel, another, next year, at Thompson, and, in 1848, one at Glandorf. Each of these became the centre of religious influence for a large district. <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Father Brunner</a> was born at Mumliswil, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 10 January, 1795, entered the <a href="../cathen/12374a.htm">Congregation of the Precious Blood</a> in 1838, and, after taking part in the establishment of a community in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, formed a project of a mission in America.

<p>In April, 1845, Bishop Purcell, with a large gathering of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and pupils of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the German church of St. John the Baptist, Green Street, <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, to be dedicated on 1 November of the same year, by Bishop Henni of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, who had done so much for the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. St. Mary's church, at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, was dedicated for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, 29 June, 1843. In 1844 <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> of <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a> estimated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> at 50,000, one third being of German origin. At this time, <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a> possessed the German <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Aloysius. The <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of St. Joseph's, another church for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, under the care of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, was laid in April, 1844. A letter sent, in 1850, by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> to the Leopold Association, gives the condition of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at this time. &#151; Four of the ten churches in <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a> were exclusively German. The Germans had their own <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> and an <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, with sisters from <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Three German congregations in Scott County were attended by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Benton. Two congregations in St. Charles County had each a German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Those in Washington County were attended by two German Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; and three other fathers attended four congregations in Osage and Cole Counties. Jefferson City had a German congregation and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In Gasconade County, the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were erecting a church. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was about to send a German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to Montgomery County. Those at Boonville were visited by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but had no church, while those in Pettis, with five or six small congregations, were regularly visited.

<p>By the close of the year 1844 the Rt. Rev. William Quarter, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, had twenty-three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, one at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (the Rev. C. H. Ostlangenberg) to care for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, while Quincy had its German congregation and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. With a steadily increasing German flock, he appealed, and not in vain, to the Leopold Association and made plans to give them a church of their own in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, as they were estimated at one thousand. Chapels were being erected at St. Peter's and at Teutopolis. After <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1850, the Rt. Rev. James Oliver van de Velde, the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, dedicated St. Joseph's church, at Grosse Pointe, or New Trier, erected by the Rev. Henry Fortmann, and exhorted the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at Ridgeville to commence building. in 1844, the Rev. Ivo Schacht, who had a large district, embracing several counties of the <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">State of Tennessee</a>, laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of a church at Clarksville. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Nashville desired a church of their own, and Bishop Miles appealed in their behalf to the Leopold Association.

<p>When, in 1846, Bishop Loras of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, visited New Vienna, he found there 250 Germans, all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There were at that time more or less Germans everywhere in that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and almost all farmers. On 19 April, 1846, Bishop Henni, of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of St. Mary's German Church in that city. Before the Mexican War had begun, German settlements were established at Couhi, New Braunsfels, and Fredericksburg, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. About the year 1849 the Rev. Gregory Menzel was labouring among his countrymen at the two last-named places, as well as at Bastrop and Austin, urging <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, for the sake of the future of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, to gather near each other so as to enjoy the benefits of church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Bishop Odin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, in 1851, visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and, before the end of the following year, had the consolation of bringing with him four <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> to take care of his increasing German flock.

<p>In the Diocese of Pittsburg the community of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had grown and prospered. New lands were acquired, and suitable buildings for various purposes were erected. In 1855, <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Prior Wimmer</a> visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, on 24 August, made St. Vincent's an exempt <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and on 17 September appointed the <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Rt. Rev. Boniface Wimmer</a> mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for a term of three years. St. Vincent's College, opened in 1849, had thriven with the growth of the community and soon had a large number of students. The course was thorough, and pupils had special advantages for acquiring a practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of German. The <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorists</a> were labouring earnestly in Pittsburg, under <a href="../cathen/13681b.htm">Father Seelos</a> and others. in 1851 they laid the foundation of St. Joseph's German Orphan Asylum. When, in 1853, the <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">See of Erie</a> was erected, the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had a little church in that city. Williamsburg, New York, had a German church of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> many years before the <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Diocese of Brooklyn</a>, to which it now belongs, was erected. In <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, St. Boniface's, purchased from the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a>, was dedicated for the use of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in 1854, as were <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy's</a> in East New York. From the year 1849, the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at Elizabeth, <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a>, were visited by the <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptorist</a> Fathers till the Rev. Augustine Dantner, O.S.F., became their resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1852. Bishop Bayley endeavoured to secure the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> for St. Mary's German Church, <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, and in 1856 the <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Rt. Rev. Abbot Wimmer</a> sent Father Valentine Felder, O.S.B., to that city. Two years later, St. Michael's German church was dedicated. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, sent a colony of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. They settled in Spencer County, where they founded the Abbey of St. Meinrad. At that time, the Very Rev. Jos. Kundeck had been for twenty years <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in which he laboured most zealously. In 1857 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> established the <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Diocese of Fort Wayne</a>, selecting for its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Rev. Henry Luers, born near <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 29 September, 1819. He soon dedicated St. Mary's German church, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of which was the Rev. Joseph Wentz. In the summer of 1858 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers of the Province of the Holy Cross founded a residence at Teutopolis, Effingham County, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, under the Very Rev. Damian Hennewig. The <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was laid in 1861, and the institution arose at Quincy. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a> was, in June, 1860, destroyed by a tornado, but the congregation <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> set to work to replace it by a more substantial edifice. In 1856, the Salesianum, the famous <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, was opened, with the Very Rev. Michael Heiss as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13415a.htm">Rev. Dr. Joseph Salzmann</a> as leading professor. The church of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1861. The fine church of St. Joseph was erected at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, in 1856, by Rev. C. Holzhauer. A community of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Order</a>, destined to spread to many parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and to distinguish itself by successful mission work, arose in the diocese. Two <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, Fathers Haas and Frey, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of establishing a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> house. After some correspondence, a father of the order came from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and opened a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, receiving the two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in 1857. After their profession <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> came, the community grew, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed their labours wonderfully. The first German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on record in Upper <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, was the Rev. Florian Schweninger, who first appears at Shasta, in 1854. He must have arrived in 1853. In 1856 the Rev. Sebastian Wolf had charge of a station in Placerville, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. He was later (1858-59) stationed at St. Patrick's church as assistant, but preached the German sermon at St. Mary's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, at the nine-o'clock Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. He began to erect a church for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> early in 1860, and since then St. Boniface's congregation has formed an independent <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. He remained <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> until the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> called from St. Louis some <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who took charge and, in 1893, founded another German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, St. Anthony's, in the southern part of the city. In the lower part of the State, the Diocese of Monterey, the first German name found in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> records of San Diego is that of the Rev. J. Christ. Holbein, missionary Apostolic, who was in charge of both the former Indian mission and the city of San Diego, from July, 1849, to February, 1850. A German settlement for the first time appears in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Directory as an out-mission of Santa Anna in 1867, but it had no German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> until years after. It is St. Boniface's. The first German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a>, St. Joseph's, was organized in 1888; the first German church in Sacramento in 1894. German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> went to work in what is now <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> and <a href="../cathen/15560a.htm">Washington</a>, with others of their order, in the early forties, and since then German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have arisen. No German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or settlers of account reached <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> until within the last fifteen or twenty years.

<p>Gradually German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were to be found in nearly every part of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, especially in New York, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and New Jersey, everywhere establishing flourishing congregations with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and churches. The number of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> can only be given approximately. Over one-third of the Gerrmans from the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, as well as the majority of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; accordingly, almost one-half of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in this country should be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. making liberal allowance for the leakage, we may safely say that at least one-fourth, i.e. over three millions, are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This is a conservative estimate. The leakage is considerable among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of all nationalities. For the defection of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in particular, the following reasons must be assigned. Where Germans settled in small numbers, frequently there were no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own tongue. Left to themselves, they were in a condition of religious isolation; they gradually neglected religious practices and finally lost their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Although this applies to all immigrants who do not speak English, it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> specially disastrous in the case of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. As over one-half of the German settlers were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and frequently had churches and various church organizations, there was a non-Catholic atmosphere around them; <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, particularly in such placed, frequently resulted in losses to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Great as the contributions of the immigrants of '48 were to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> advancement of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, it cannot be denied that, on the whole, their influence was not favourable from a religious viewpoint. The same must be said of certain German organizations, as the turnvereins, which frequently manifested an anti-Catholic, and even anti-religious, spirit. Nor can it be denied that Socialistic principles were largely spread by German immigrants and German publications. Small wonder that hundreds of thousands of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> have been lost to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h3>German churches and religious communities</h3>

<p>No attempt is made to give exact statistics of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, because such are not available at the present time. A general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, however, can be formed from the fact, that among the 15,655 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Directory for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, about one third bear German names. Among the more distinguished German <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, mention should be made of John Martin Henni, first Bishop, and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>; Michael Heiss, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>; Seb. Gebhard Messmer, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, now <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>; Winand S. Wigger, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, a wise ruler, a devout <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and notable for his practical work as head of the St. Raphael Society for the protection of immigrants; and most particularly of the saintly Bishop Neumann of Philadelphia, whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is the earnest hope of all American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>Of the great number of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> orders and congregations of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> labouring in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> for man's spiritual or physical welfare, the following are of German origin and even now (1909) are recruited chiefly from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> or their descendants:-

<p>Beside all these, there are several smaller German religious congregations in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In other congregations also, not of German foundation, there are now many German sisters. There must be, therefore, upwards of twelve thousand sisters of German origin in this country.
<h3>Parochial schools</h3>

<p>From the very beginning, of their settling in this country the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had at heart the establishing of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Interesting details are given concerning the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Goshenhoppen and Conewago. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Goshenhoppen was begun by Father Schneider, S.J. (who had previously served as Rector Magnificus, or elective head, of Heidelberg University), soon after his arrival, in 1741. It was under his charge for twenty years, and under Father Ritter's during the twenty-three succeeding years. it was attended by the children of the whole neighbourhood, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, it being the only one in the place. About the time of the close of the French and Indian War, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, fo rthe first time, engaged the services of a lay teacher. Contrary to the custom which prevailed in the Colonies generally, the schoolmaster was looked upon as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of distinction in the little world of Goshenhoppen. Three schoolmasters are mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> registers between 1763 and 1796; Henry Fredder, Breitenbach, and John Lawrence Gubernator. The last-named was no doubt the most distinguished of the three. Born at Oppenheim, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in 1735, he served as an officer in the army of the Allies in the Seven Years' War, and came to America during the Revolutionary War. highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, and a devoted teacher, he rendered eminent services to the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, during a period of twenty-five years. When, about 1787, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> near Conewago was so far developed as to be able to support a lay teacher, the services of this famous schoolmaster were obtained.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, along with the other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> established and conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, have greatly influenced the development of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. This early <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for founding <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is typical of the activity of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> during all succeeding periods. Wherever they settled in sufficient numbers the schoolhouse soon rose by the side of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and until the present day they have never ceased to be staunch and unflinching and advocates of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system.
<h3>Societies</h3>

<p>The natural inclination and aptitude of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> for organization issued in the formation of numerous social and religious associations. Besides <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and local <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> there is one organization which exerted a far-reaching influence, namely, the Central-Verein. The wonderful organization of the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a> in the Fatherland and the admirable unity shown by the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> during the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>, naturally stimulated the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to unite their efforts in vast organizations. "Germany is the land of fearless Catholcity, where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have made themselves respected . . . . . There is a vigor in German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, both political and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, that should excite our admiration, and be for us a splendid example for imitation. Who can reflect upon the work of the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>, from <a href="../cathen/09571a.htm">Mallinckrodt</a> and <a href="../cathen/09571a.htm">Windthorst</a> to the late lamented <a href="../cathen/09235a.htm">Lieber</a>, without a feeling of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and satisfaction?" (Father John Conway, S.J.). &#151; There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Central-Verein would never become what it now is without the noble example of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Founded in 1855, the Central-Verein had for its object, above all, the material aid of its members. But gradually, it broadened its programme, and it became one of the objects of the organization "to stand for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". It has been said, and justly, that perhaps no other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organization in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> can point to a greater number of positive results, tending to promote the welfare of our fellow-men, than the Central-Verein. It has been a firm support of our youthful and flourishing Church, and has nobly contributed towards its gratifying development. For decades it has unflinchingly laboured in the interest of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>. Chiefly under its influence were founded the Teachers' Seminary, at St. Francis, and the Leo House, an institution in New York City for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants by which thousands have been rescued from bodily and spiritual perdition. The German American <em>Katholikentage</em> likewise owed their origin to the activity of the men of the Central-Verein, after the model of the famous annual assemblies of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in the Fatherland. The influence of this splendid organization on the formation of the Federation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Societies cannot be overrated. &#151; "The young organization breathes the spirit which animated the Central-Verein during the past fifty years; the programme of the Federation, in its essential parts, is identical with that of the Central-Verein, so that the former helps to further and complete what the vigorous and valiant Germans began." &#151; Together with Bishop McFaul of <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a>, the German <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Messmer, of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, is the prime mover and leading spirit of the Federation.
<h3>The press</h3>

<p>More than twenty-five weekly papers are published in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> for the benefit of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, besides a goodly number of monthly periodicals. The first German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, "Der Wahrheitsfreund", was established in 1837, by the Rev. John M. Henni. After an existence of almost seventy years it ceased to appear in 1907. Another weekly which no longer exists, but which for many years rendered essential service to religion, was the "Katholische Kirchenzeitung". <a href="../cathen/11215a.htm">Maximilian Oertel</a>, the founder of this weekly, was born at Ansbach, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, in 1811, and arrived in this country in the beginning of the year 1839, highly commended by the heads of his denomination, to attend <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheran</a> immigrants in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. on 15 March of the following year he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which he remained <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful throughout the rest of his life, doing excellent service to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause as one of the most brilliant editors the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> ever produced in this country. The "Ohio Waisenfreund", founded in 1873, and edited by the indefatigable Rev. Jos. Jessing, later Monsignore, has a larger circulation than any other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly in the country. It has been doing a great amount of good these thirty-five years, the finest monument of its missionary spirit being the "Josephinum", a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Whereas and English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily for many years has been a desideratum not yet realized, the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have two daily papers: "Amerika" (St. Louis), from 1878-1902 under the editorship of the famous Dr. Edward Preuss, and the Buffalo Volksfreund" (<a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, New York). In connection with these periodical publications, may be mentioned the "Pastoral-Blatt", for a number of years edited by the Rev. W. F&auml;rber, of <a href="../cathen/13357a.htm">St. Louis</a>, which existed long before the able English "Ecclesiastical Review" was founded and edited by Dr. Herman J. Heuser.

<p>It is surely deserving of notice that among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publishers in this century the German names of Benziger, <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12583a.htm">Pustet</a> stand in the front rank. Nor should it be overlooked, that the translations of German religious works &#151; as <a href="../cathen/04678a.htm">Deharbe's</a> Catechism, <a href="../cathen/15646b.htm">Wilmer's</a> "Hand-book of the Christian Religion", Schuster's Bible History, the works of Knecht, <a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a>, <a href="../cathen/03004a.htm">Br&uuml;ck</a>, Spirago, Schanz, <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a>, etc. &#151; have been largely used, and are still being used, for the religious instruction of American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The words of Father John A. Conway, S.J. (in the preface to Fr. von Hammerstein's work, "Edgar, or from Atheism to the Full Truth") may well be quoted in this connection: "Who can read the words that teem from the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press without feeling that the defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> truth is in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> and fearless hands? It is in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> that the fiercest onslaughts are made upon <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a>, materialists, pantheists, <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantians</a>, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelians</a>, evolutionists, etc. But it is from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, too, that we get our best defence and our ablest expositions of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a>." Thus we see that, although the efforts of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, naturally, are concerned in the first place, with the religious affairs of their own people, still their activity has produced beneficial results for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body in general.
