<h1>Germany</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Before 1556</h2>

<p>From their first appearance in the history of the world the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> represented the principle of unchecked <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a>, as opposed to the Roman principle of an all-embracing authority. German history in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was strongly influenced by two opposing principles: universalism and <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a>. After Arminius had fought for German freedom in the Teutoburg Forest the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the race was entitled to be independent gradually became a powerful factor in its historical development. This conception first took form when the Germanic states grew out of the Roman Empire. Even <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric the Great</a> thought of uniting the discordant barbarian countries with the aid of the <em>leges gentium</em> into a great confederation of the Mediterranean. Although in these Mediterranean countries the Roman principle finally prevailed, being that of a more advanced civilization, still the individualistic forces which contributed to found these states were not wasted. By them the world-embracing empire of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was overthrown and the way prepared for the national principle. It was not until after the fall of the Western Empire that a great <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom became possible and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, no longer held in check by the Roman Empire, were able to draw together the tribes of the old Teutonic stock and to lay the foundation of a German empire. Before this the Germanic tribes had been continually at variance; no tie bound them together; even the common language failed to produce unity. On the other hand, the so-called <em>Lautverschiebung</em>, or shifting of the consonants, in German, separated the North and South Germans. Nor was German mythology a source of union, for the tribal centres of worship rather increased the already existing particularism. The Germans had not even a common name. Since the eighth century most probably the designations <em><a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a></em> and <em><a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a></em> extended beyond the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> tribe. It was not, however, until the ninth century that the expression <em>theodisk</em> (later German <em>Deutsch</em>), signifying "popular," or "belonging to people" made its appearance and a great stretch of time divided this beginning from the use of the word as a name of the nation.

<p>The work of uniting Germany was not begun by a tribe living in the interior but by one on the outskirts of the country. The people called <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> suddenly appear in history in the third century. They represented no single tribe, but consisted of a combination of Low and High German tribes. Under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis (Chlodwig)</a> the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> overthrew the remains of the Roman power in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and built up the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> state on a Germano-Romanic foundation. The German tribes were conquered one after another and colonized in the Roman manner. Large extents of territory were marked out as belonging to the king, and on these military colonies were founded. The commanders of these military colonies gradually became administrative functionaries, and the colonies themselves grew into peaceful agricultural village communities. For a long time political expressions, such as <em>Hundreds</em>, recalled the original military character of the people. From that time the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> ruler became the German overlord, but the centrifugal tendency of the Germanic tribes reacted against this sovereignty as soon as the Merovingian Dynasty began slowly to decline, owing to internal feuds. In each of the tribes after this the duke rose to supremacy over his fellow tribesmen. From the seventh century the tribal duke became an almost independent sovereign. These ducal states originated in the supreme command of large bodies of troops, and then in the administration of large territories by dukes. At the same time the disintegration was aided by the bad administration of the counts, the officials in charge of the territorial districts (<em>Gau</em>), who were no longer supervised by the central authority. But what was most disastrous was that an unruly aristocracy sought to control all the economical interests and to exercise arbitrary powers over politics. These sovereign nobles had become powerful through the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system, a form of government which gave to <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Germany its peculiar character. Caesar in his day found that it was customary among the Gauls for a freeman, the "client," <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to enter into a relation of dependence on a "senior." This surrender (<em>commendatio</em>) took place in order to obtain the protection of the lord or to gain the usufruct of land. From this Gallic system of clientship there developed, in <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> times, the conception of the "lord's man" (<em>homagium</em> or <em>hominium</em>), who by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> swore fealty to his suzerain and became a <em>vassus</em>, or <em>gasindus</em>, or <em>homo</em>. The result of the growth of this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that finally there appeared, throughout the kingdom, along with royalty, powerful territorial lords with their <em>vassi</em> or <em>vassalli</em>, as their followers were called from the eighth century. The vassals received as fief (<em>beneficium</em>) a piece of land of which they enjoyed the use for life. The struggle of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> quickened the development of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system, for the necessity of creating an army of horsemen then became evident. Moreover the poorer freemen, depressed in condition by the frequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, could not be required to do service as horsemen, a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> that could only be demanded from the vassals of the great landowners. In order to force these territorial lords to do military service fiefs were granted from the already existing public domain, and in their turn the great lords granted part of these fiefs to their retainers. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king was gradually transformed from a lord of the land and people to a <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord over the beneficiaries directly and indirectly dependent upon him by <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tenure. By the end of the ninth century the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system had bound together the greater part of the population.

<p>While in this way the secular aristocracy grew into a power, at the same time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was equally strengthened by <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> during this era &#151; a fact of the greatest importance &#151; was the guardian of the remains of classical culture. With this culture the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to endow the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Moreover it was to bring them a great fund of new moral conceptions and principles, much increase in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and skill in art and handicrafts. The well-knit organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the convincing <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, the grandeur of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the sweet poetry of the liturgy, all these captured the understanding of the simple-minded but fine-natured primitive German. It was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in fact, that first brought the exaggerated <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a> of the race under control and developed in it gradually, by means of asceticism, those social virtues essential to the State. The country was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> very slowly for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had here a difficult problem to solve, namely, to replace the natural conception of life by an entirely different one that appeared strange to the people. The acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> was at first a purely mechanical one, but it became an inner conviction. No people has shown a more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> or deeper comprehension of the organization and saving aims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. None has exhibited a like devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor did any people contribute more in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than the German. In the conversion of Germany much credit is due the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Scotch, but the real founders of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Germany are the Anglo-Saxons, above all <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. Among the early missionaries were: St. Columbanus, the first to come to the Continent (about 583), who laboured in Swabia; Fridolin, the founder of Saeckingen; Pirminius, who established the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> in 724; and Gallus (d. 645), the founder of St. Gall. The cause of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was furthered in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> by Rupert of Worms (beginning of the seventh century), Corbinian (d. 730), and Emmeram (d. 715). The great organizer of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. The chief herald of the Faith among the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> was the Scotchman, <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> (end of the seventh century); the Frisians received <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> through Willibrord (d. 739). The real Apostle of Germany was <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, whose chief work was in Central Germany and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Acting in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he organized the German Church, and finally in 755 met the death of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> at the hands of the Frisians. After the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had thus obtained a good foothold it soon reached a position of much importance in the eyes of the youthful German peoples. By grants of land the princes gave it an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> power which was greatly increased when many freemen <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> became dependents of these new spiritual lords; thus, besides the secular territorial aristocracy, there developed a second power, that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes. Antagonism between these two elements was perceptible at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Pepin sought to remove the difficulty by strengthening the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church and placing between the secular and spiritual lords the new <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> king, who, by the assumption of the title <em><a href="../cathen/04679a.htm">Dei gratia</a></em>, obtained a somewhat <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>.



<p>The Augustinian conception of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> early influenced the Frankish State; political and religious theories unconsciously blended. The union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> seemed the ideal which was to be realized. Each needed the other; the State needed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the only source of real order and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> needed for its activities the protection of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>. In return for the training in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and learning that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gave, the State granted it large <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a>, such as: the <em>privilegium fori</em> or freedom from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the State; <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunity</a>, that is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">exemption</a> from taxes and services to the State, from which gradually grew the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive the taxes of the tenants residing on the <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">exempt</a> lands and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to administer <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to them; further, release from military service; and, finally, the granting of great fiefs that formed the basis of the later ecclesiastical sovereignties. The reverse of this picture soon became apparent; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to whom had been given lands and offices in fief became dependent on secular lords. Thus the State at an early date had a share in the making of ecclesiastical laws, exercised the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of patronage, appointed to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and soon undertook, especially in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, the secularization of church lands. Consequently the question of the relation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> soon claimed attention; it was the most important question in the history of the German <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Under the <a href="../cathen/03618a.htm">first German emperor</a> this problem seemed to find its solution.

<p>Real German history begins with <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (768-814). The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Saxons was the most important one he carried on, and the result of this struggle, of fundamental importance for German history, was that the Saxons were brought into connexion with the other Germanic tribes and did not fall under Scandinavian influence. The lasting union of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Saxons, Frisians, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringians</a>, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hessians</a>, Alamanni, and Bavarians, that <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> effected, formed the basis of a national combination which gradually lost sight of the fact that it was the product of compulsion. From the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> the above-named German tribes lived under <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> constitution retaining their own old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the <em>leges barbarorum</em>, which <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> codified. Another point of importance for German development was that <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> fixed the boundary between his domain and the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, including the Wends, on the farther side of the Elbe and Saale Rivers. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> did not do all this according to a deliberate plan, but mainly in the endeavour to win these related Germanic peoples over to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> German policy, therefore, was not a mere brute conquest, but a union which was to be strengthened by the ties of morality and culture to be created by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. The amalgamation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> with the secular elements that had begun in the reign of Pepin reached its completion under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The fact that Pepin obtained <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval of his kingdom strengthened the bond between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom. The consciousness of being the champion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, moreover, gave to the King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the predestined protectors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; thus he attained a position of great importance in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was filled with these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; like St. Augustine he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> empire. The type of <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">God's Kingdom</a> to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and his councillors was not the Roman Empire but the Jewish theocracy. This type was kept in view when <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> undertook to give reality to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king desired like Solomon to be a great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular potentate, a royal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was conscious that his conception of his position as the head of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, according to the German <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, was opposed to the essence of Roman Caesarism, and for reason he objected to being <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by the Pope on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 800. On this day the Germanic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was the representative, bowed to the Roman <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, which regards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as its centre, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the seat of the old empire and the most sacred place of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> when emperor still regarded himself as the real leader of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Although in 774 he confirmed the gift of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to the Roman <em>res publica</em>, nevertheless he saw to it that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> remained connected with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> State; in return it had a claim to <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> protection. He even interfered in dogmatic questions.

<p><a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> looked upon the revived Roman Empire from the ancient point of view inasmuch as he greatly desired recognition by the Eastern Empire. He regarded his possession of the empire as resulting solely from his own power, consequently he himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his son Louis. Yet on the other hand he looked upon his empire only as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> one, whose most noble calling it was to train up the various races within its borders to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and thus to unify them. The empire rapidly declined under his weak and nerveless son, Louis the Pious (814-40). The decay was hastened by the prevailing <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that this State was the personal property of the sovereign, a view that contained the germ of constant quarrels and necessitated the division of the empire when there were several sons. Louis sought to prevent the dangers of such division by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of hereditary succession published in 817, by which the sovereign power and the imperial crown were to be passed to the oldest son. This law was probably enacted through the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">influence of the Church</a>, which maintained positively this unity of the supreme power and the Crown, as being in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, and as besides required by the hierarchical economy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> organization. When Louis had a fourth son, by his second wife, Judith, he immediately set aside <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of partition of 817 for the benefit of the new heir. An odious struggle broke out between father and sons, and among the sons themselves. In 833 the emperor was captured by his sons at the battle of Luegenfeld (field of lies) near Colmar. <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Pope Gregory IV</a> was at the time in the camp of the sons. The demeanour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the humiliating ecclesiastical penance that Louis was compelled to undergo at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> made apparent the change that had come about since <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in the theory of the relations of Church and State. <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory's</a> view that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was under the rule of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">representative of Christ</a>, and that it was a higher authority, not only spiritually but also substantially, and therefore politically, had before this found learned defenders in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In opposition to the oldest son Lothair, Louis and Pepin, sons of Louis the Pious, restored the father to his throne (834), but new rebellions followed, when the sons once more grew dissatisfied.

<p>In 840 the emperor died near Ingelheim. The quarrels of the sons went on after the death of the father, and in 841 Lothair was completely defeated near Fontenay (Fontanetum) by Louis the German and Charles the Bald. The empire now fell apart, not from the force of national hatreds, but in consequence of the partition now made and known as the Treaty of Verdun (August, 843), which divided the territory between the sons of Louis the Pious: Lothair, Louis the German (843-76), and Charles the Bald, and which finally resulted in the complete overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> monarchy.

<p>As the imperial power grew weaker, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gradually raised itself above the State. The <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> behaviour of Lothair II, who, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> himself from his lawful wife in order to marry his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a>, brought deep disgrace on his kingdom. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> however, now an imposing and well-organized power, sat in judgment on the adulterous king. When Lothair II died, his uncles divided his possessions between them; by the Treaty of Ribemont (Mersen), <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, which lay between the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom of Louis the German and the West Frankish Kingdom of Charles the Bald, was assigned to the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom. In this way a long-enduring boundary was definitely drawn between the growing powers of Germany and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. By a curious chance this boundary coincided almost exactly with the linguistic dividing line. Charles the Fat (876-87), the last son of Louis the German, united once more the entire empire. But according to old Germanic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> the weak emperor forfeited his sovereignty by his cowardice when the dreaded <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> appeared before <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on one of their frequent incursions into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and by his incapacity as a ruler. Consequently the Eastern <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> made his nephew Arnulf (887-99) king. This change was brought about by a revolt of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in alliance with the emperor. The danger of Norman invasion Arnulf ended once and for all by his victory in 891 at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> on the Dyle. In the East also he was victorious after the death (894) of Swatopluk, the great King of Moravia. The conduct of some of the great nobles forced him to turn for aid to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; supported by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 896. Theoretically his rule extended over the West Frankish Kingdom, but the sway of his son, Louis the Child (899-911), the last descendant of the male line of the German Carlovingians, was limited entirely to the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom. Both in the East and West Frankish Kingdoms, in this era of confusion, the nobility grew steadily stronger, and freemen in increasing numbers became vassals in order to escape the burdens that the State laid on them; the illusion of the imperial title could no longer give strength to the empire. Vassal princes like Guido and Lamberto of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and Berengar of Friuli, were permitted to wear the diadem of the Caesars.

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of political unity declined, that of the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> increased in power. The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, which the royal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, by his overshadowing <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> had, in his own opinion, made a fact, proved to be an impossibility. <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, which for a short time were united in <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, had, as early as the reign of Louis the Pious, become separated. The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> was now identified with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> asserted that the head of the one and indivisible Church could not be subordinate to any <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, that only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that it was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on princes to obey the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in spiritual things, and finally that the Carlovingians had received their right to rule from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This grand <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of unity, this all-controlling sentiment of a common bond, could not be annihilated even in these troubled times when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was humiliated by petty Italian rulers. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of her unity gave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the strength to raise herself rapidly to a position higher than that of the State. From the age of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom had direct relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, while numerous new churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> gave her a firm hold in this region. At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> here controlled the entire <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and, as the depositary of all culture, the entire <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life. She had also gained frequently decisive influence over German <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> life, for she disseminated much of the skill and many of the crafts of antiquity. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself had grown into an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> power in the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom. Piety led many to place themselves and their lands under the control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>There was also in this period a change in social life that was followed by important social consequences. The old militia composed of every freeman capable of bearing arms went to pieces, because the freemen constantly decreased in number. In its stead there arose a higher order in the State, which alone was called on for military service. In this chaotic era the German people made no important advance in civilization. Nevertheless the union that had been formed between Roman and German elements and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> prepared the way for a development of the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom in civilization from which great results might be expected. At the close of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period the external position of the kingdom was a very precarious one. The piratic <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> boldly advanced far into the empire; Danes and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> continually crossed its borders; but the most dangerous incursions were those of the Magyars, who in 907 brought terrible suffering upon <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; in their marauding expeditions they also ravaged Saxony, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, and Swabia. It was then that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came from the empire itself. The weak authority of the last of the Carlovingians, Louis the Child, an infant in years, fell to pieces altogether, and the old ducal form of government revived in the several tribes. This was in accordance with the desires of the people. In these critical times the dukes sought to save the country; still they saw clearly that only a union of all the duchies could successfully ward off the danger from without; the royal power was to find its entire support in the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Once more, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the attempt was made by King Conrad I (911-18) to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the basis of the royal power, but the centralizing <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> policy of the king was successfully resisted by the subordinate powers. Henry I (919-36) was the free choice of the lay powers at Fritzlar. On the day he was elected the old theory of the State as the personal estate of the sovereign was finally done away with, and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> realm was transformed into a German one. The manner of his election made plain to Henry the course to be pursued. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to yield to the wish of the several tribes to have their separate existence with a measure of self-government under the imperial power recognized. Thus the duchies were strengthened at the expense of the Crown. The fame of Henry I was assured by his victory over the Magyars near Merseburg (933). By regaining Lorraine, that had been lost during the reign of Conrad, he secured a bulwark on the side towards <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that permitted the uninterrupted consolidation of his realm. The same result was attained on other frontiers by his successful campaigns against the Wends and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>. Henry's kingdom was made up of a confederation of tribes, for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a "King of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>" did not yet exist. It was only as the "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" that Germany could develop from a union of German tribes to a compact nation. As supporters of the supreme power, as vassals of the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> were united.

<p>This imperial policy was continued by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, the Great (936-73). During his long reign Otto sought to found a strong central power in Germany, an effort at once opposed by the particularistic powers of Germany, who took advantage of disputes in the royal family. Otto <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the necessity of a strong government by his victory over the Magyars near Augsburg (955), one result of which was the reestablishment of the East Mark. After this he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a>, who had been threatened by <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> II of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and by making a treaty that secured to the imperial dignity a share in the election of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he attained the imperial crown, 2 February, 962. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Otto to obtain imperial power in order to carry out his politico-ecclesiastical policy. His intention was to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> an organic feature of the German constitution. This he could only do if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was absolutely under his control, and this could not be attained unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were included within the sphere of his power. The emperor's aim was to found his royal power among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, who were strongly inclined to particularism, upon a close union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The Germans had now revived the empire and had freed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from its unfortunate entanglement with the nobility of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> rapidly regained strength and quickly renewed the policy of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>. By safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> protected both the peaceful development of civilization, which was dependent upon religion, and the progress of culture which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> spread. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, in union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, founded the civilization of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. For Germany itself the heroic age of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> emperors was a period of progress in learning. The renaissance of antiquity during the era of the Ottos was hardly more than superficial. Nevertheless it denoted a development in learning, throughout <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> in character, in marked contrast to the tendencies in the same age of the grammarian Wilgard at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, who sought to revive not only the literature of ancient times, but also the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of antiquity, even when they opposed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Germany now boldly assumed the leadership of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and thus prevented any other power from claiming the supremacy. Moreover the new empire sought to assert its universal character in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as well as in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Otto also fixed his eyes on Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which was in the hands of the Greeks, but he preferred a peaceful policy with Byzantium. He therefore married his son <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, in 972, to the Greek Princess Theophano.

<p><a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> (973-83) and his son <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> (983-1002) firmly upheld the union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>. <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> aimed at a great development of his power along the Mediterranean; these plans naturally turned his mind from a national German policy. His campaign against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, however, came to a disastrous end in Calabria in 982, and he did not long survive the calamity. His romantic son sought to bring about a complete revival of the ancient empire, the centre of which was to be <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as in ancient times. There, in union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he wished to establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor were to be the wielders of a power one and indivisible. This idealistic policy, full of vague abstractions, led to severe German losses in the east, for the Poles and Hungarians once more gained their independence. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Arduin of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a> founded a new kingdom; naturally enough the Apennine Peninsula revolted against the German imperial policy. Without possession of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, however, the empire was impossible, and the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the Ottonian theory of government were now manifest. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> became the champion of the unity and legitimacy of the empire.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and the collapse of imperialism the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> raised Henry II (1002-24) to the throne. Henry, reviving the policy of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> which had been abandoned by <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, made Germany and the German Church the basis of his imperial system; he intended to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> had done. In 1014 he defeated Arduin and thus attained the Imperial crown. The sickly ruler, whose nervousness <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to take up projects of which he quickly tired, did his best to repair the losses of the empire on its eastern frontier. He was not able, however, to defeat the Polish King Boleslaw II: all he could do was to strengthen the position of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> on the Elbe River by an alliance with the Lusici, a Slavonic tribe. Towards the end of his reign a bitter dispute broke out between the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At the Synod of Seligenstadt, in 1023, Archbishop Aribo of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, who was an opponent of the Reform of Cluny, made an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy of Aribo's would have led in the end to the founding of a national German Church independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The greater part of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> supported Aribo, but the emperor held to the party of reform. Henry, however, did not live to see the quarrel settled.

<p>With Conrad II (1024-39) began the sway of the Franconian (Salian) emperors. The sovereigns of this line were vigorous, vehement, and autocratic rulers. Conrad had natural political ability and his reign is the most flourishing era of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> imperialism. The international position of the empire was excellent. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Conrad strengthened the German power, and his relations with King Canute of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> were friendly. Internal disputes kept the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> from becoming dangerous; moreover, by regaining Lusatia the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> recovered the old preponderance against the Poles. Important gains were also made in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, whereby the old Romanic states, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, were for a long time separated and the great passes of the Alps controlled by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. The close connexion with the empire enabled the German population of north-western <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to preserve its nationality. Conrad had also kept up the close union of the State with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and had maintained his authority over the latter. He claimed for himself the same right of ruling the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that his predecessors had exercised, and like them appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>; he also reserved to himself the entire control of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. Conrad's <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy, however, lacked definiteness; he failed to understand the most important interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor did he grasp the necessity of reform. Neither did he do anything to raise the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, discredited by <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a> and <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>, from its dependence on the civil rulers of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The aim of his financial policy was <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> emancipation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; royal financial officials took their place alongside of the <em>ministeriales</em>, or financial agents, of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Conrad sought to rest his kingdom in Germany on these royal officials and on the petty vassals. In this way the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> was to be the guarantee of the emperor's independence of the episcopate. As he pursued the same methods in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he was able to maintain an independent position between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the petty Italian despots who were at strife with one another. Thus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence in Conrad's theory of government becomes less prominent.

<p>This statesmanlike sovereign was followed by his son, the youthful Henry III (1039-56). Unlike his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Henry had a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; he had also been trained from an early age in State affairs. He was a born ruler and allowed himself to be influenced by no one; to force of character and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> he added a strong sense of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. His foreign policy was at first successful. He established the suzerainty of the empire over <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, without, however, being always able to maintain it; <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> also remained a dependent state. The empire gained a dominant position in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and a sense of national <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> was awakened in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> that opened the way for a national spirit. But the aim of these national aspirations, the hegemony in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, was a mere phantom. Each time an emperor went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> that country had to be reconquered. Even at this very time the imperial supremacy was in great danger from the threatened conflict between the imperial and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> power, between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the only guide on earth to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, had attained dominion over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, whom it strove to wean from the earthly and to lead to the spiritual. The glaring contrast between the ideal and the reality awoke in thousands the desire to leave the world. A spirit of asceticism, which first appeared in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, took possession of many hearts. As early as the era of the first Saxon emperors the attempt was made to introduce the reform movement of Cluny into Germany, and in the reign of Henry III this reform had become powerful. Henry himself laid much more stress than his predecessors on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> side of his royal position. His religious views led him to side with the men of Cluny. The great mistake of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy was the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that it was possible to promote this reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by laying stress on his suzerain authority. He repeatedly called and presided over <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and issued many decisions in Church affairs. His fundamental mistake, the thought that he could transform the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the manner desired by the party of reform and at the same time maintain his dominion over it, was also evident in his relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He sought to put an end to the disorder at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, caused by the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, by the energetic measure of deposing the three contending <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and raising <a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Clement <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him emperor and made him Patrician of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thus Henry seemed to have regained the same control over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that Otto had exercised. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, purified by the elevated conceptions of the party of reform and freed by Henry from the influence of the degenerate Roman aristocracy, strove to be absolutely independent. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was now to be released from all human bonds. The chief aims of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> policy were the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>, the presentation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, and the attainment by these means of as great a centralization as possible. Henry had acted with absolute honesty in raising the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, but he did not intend that it should outgrow his control. Sincerely <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, he was convinced of the possibility and necessity of complete accord between empire and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. His fanciful policy became an unpractical <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>. Consequently the monarchical power began rapidly to decline in strength. <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> regained freedom, the southern part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was held by the Normans, and the Duchy of Lorraine, already long a source of trouble, maintained its hostility to the king. By the close of the reign of Henry III discontent was universal in the empire, thus permitting a growth of the particularistic powers, especially of the dukes.

<p>When Henry III died Germany had reached a turning-point in its history. His wife Agnes assumed the regency for their four-year-old son, Henry IV (1056-1106), and at once showed her incompetence for the position by granting the great duchies to opponents of the crown. She also sought the support of the lesser nobility and thus excited the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the great princes. A conspiracy of the more powerful nobles, led by Archbishop Anno (Hanno) of Cologne, obtained possession of the royal child by a stratagem at Kaiserswert and took control of the imperial power. Henry IV, however, preferred the guidance of Adalbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, who was able for the moment to give the governmental policy a more national character. Thus in 1063 he restored German influence over <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and the aim of his internal policy was to strengthen the central power. At the Diet of Tribur, 1066, however, he was overthrown by the particularists, but the king by now was able to assume control for himself. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had been rapidly advancing towards absolute independence. The <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> now extended the meaning of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> to the granting of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and thus demanded an entire change in the conditions of the empire and placed itself in opposition to the imperial power. The ordinances passed in 1059 for the regulation of the papal elections excluded all imperial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the same. Conditions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> grew continually more unfavourable for the empire. The chief supporters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> policy were the Normans, over whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> claimed <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> suzerainty. The German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also yielded more and more to the authority of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the Ottonian theory of government was already undermined. The question was now raised: In the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> on earth who is to rule, the emperor or the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>? In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> this question had long been settled. The powerful opponent of Henry, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, claimed that the princes should acknowledge the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">laws of God</a> should be everywhere obeyed and carried out. The struggle which now broke out was in principle a conflict concerning the respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the empire and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. But the conflict soon shifted from the spiritual to the secular domain; at last it became a conflict for the possession of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and during the struggle the spiritual and the secular were often confounded. Henry was not a match for the genius of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> and intelligent and, though of a passionate nature, fought with dogged obstinacy for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his monarchical power. But <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> as the representative of the reform movement in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, demanding complete liberty for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was too powerful for him. Aided by the inferior nobility, Henry sought to make himself absolute. The particularistic powers, however, insisted upon the maintenance of the constitutional limits of the monarchy. The revolt of the Saxons against the royal authority was led both by spiritual and secular princes, and it was not until after many humiliations that Henry was able to conquer them in the battle on the Unstrut (1075). Directly after this began his conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The occasion was the appointment of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by the emperor without regard to the election already held by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> at once sent a threatening letter to Henry. Angry at this, Henry had the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared at the Synod of Worms, 24 January, 1076. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> now felt himself released from all restraint and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the emperor. On 16 October, 1076, the German princes decided that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should pronounce judgment on the king and that unless Henry were released from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> within a year and a day he should lose his crown. Henry now sought to break the alliance between the particularists and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by a clever stroke. The German princes he could not win back to his cause, but he might gain over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. By a penitential <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> he forced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to grant him <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Henry appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> showed his greatness. He released the king from the ban, although by so doing he injured his own interests, which required that he should keep his agreement to act in union with the German princes.

<p>Thus the day of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a> (2 and 3 February, 1077) was a victory for Henry. It did not, however, mean the coming of peace, for the German confederates of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not recognize the reconciliation at <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>, and elected Duke Rudolf of Swabia as king at Forchheim, 13 March, 1077. A civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> now broke out in Germany. After long hesitation <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> finally took the side of Rudolf and once more <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Henry. Soon after this however, Rudolf lost both throne and life in the battle of Hohenmoelsen not far from Merseburg. Henry now abandoned his policy of absolutism, recognizing its impracticability. He returned to the Ottonian theory of government, and the German episcopate, which was embittered by the severity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, now came over to the side of the king. Relying upon this strife within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Henry caused <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> to be deposed by a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> and <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert of Ravenna</a> to be elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>. Accompanied by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor there in 1084. Love for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> drove the great <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> into exile where he soon after died. After the death of his mighty opponent Henry was more powerful than the particularists who had elected a new rival king, Herman of Luxembourg. In 1090 Henry went again to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to defend his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against the two powerful allies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the Normans in the south and the Countess Matilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in the north. While he was in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> his own son Conrad declared himself king in opposition to him. Overwhelmed by this blow, Henry remained inactive in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and it was not until 1097 that he returned to Germany. No reconciliation had been effected between him and <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a>. In Germany Henry sought to restore internal peace, and this popular policy intensified the particularism of the princes. In union with these the king's son, young Henry, rebelled against his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supported the revolt, and the emperor was unable to cope with so many opponents. In 1105 he abdicated. After this he once more asserted his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, but death soon closed (1106) this troubled life filled with so many thrilling and tragic events. To Henry should be ascribed the credit of saving the monarchy from the threatened collapse. He has been called the most brilliant representative of the German <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. During his reign began the development, so fruitful in results, of the German cities.

<p>Henry V (1106-25) also adopted the policy of the Ottos. In the numerous discussions of the right of investiture men of sober judgment insisted, as did the emperor, that the latter could not give up the right of the investiture of his vassal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with the regalia, that a distinction must be made between the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now made the strange proposal that the emperor should give up the investiture and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the regalia. This proposal to strip the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> would have led to a revolution in Germany. Not only would the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been unwilling to give up their position as ruling princes, but many nobles, as well as vassals of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, would have rebelled. The storm of dissatisfaction which in 1111 broke out in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to annul the prohibition of investiture. It was soon seen to be impossible to carry out the permission so granted, and the conflict regarding investitures began again. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party was again joined by the German princes antagonistic to the emperor, and the imperial forces soon suffered defeats on the Rhine and in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> party gained ground again in Germany, and the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> fell away from Henry. Notwithstanding this he went, in 1116, to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to claim the imperial <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> estates of the Countess Matilda, who had died, and to confiscate her freehold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. This action naturally made more difficult the relations between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor, and in spite of the universal weariness the conflict began anew. The influence of the German secular princes had now to be reckoned with, for at this time certain <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the secular nobility commenced to claim hereditary power and appeared as hereditary dynasties with distinct <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> names and residences. It was in the age of the Franconian emperors that the dynastic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the German principalities were founded. These princes acted as an independent power in settling the disagreement between emperor and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> was ready for peace; in 1122 an agreement was reached and the concordat was proclaimed at the Synod of Worms. In this the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed that in Germany the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should take place according to canonical procedure in the presence of the king or his representative, and that the bishop-elect should then be invested by the king with the sceptre as a symbol of the regalia. In Germany this investiture was to precede the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> it was to follow it. The emperor therefore retained all his influence in the appointment to vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and as secular princes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were responsible to him. Not withstanding this the Concordat of Worms was a defeat for the imperial claims, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> that had been hitherto a subordinate power had now become a power of at least equal rank. It was now entirely free from the control of the German Crown and held an independent position, deriving its dignity wholly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The emperor, on the contrary, received his dignity from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The talented, but intriguing and deceitful, king had greatly strengthened the anti-imperial tendency in all Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. During the great investiture conflict the other kings had freed themselves completely from the suzerainty of the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the guarantee of their independence, and he had become the representative of the whole of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, while the imperial dignity had lost the attribute of universality. The way was now open to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to become the umpire over kings and nations. There was now a truce in the conflict between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor. Only a minor question had been settled, but the conflict had awakened the intellects of men, and on both sides a voluminous controversial literature appeared. The assertion was now made that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conception of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was not realized by existing conditions. There were also other manifestations of independent thought. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> opened a new world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; historical writing made rapid progress, and art ventured upon new forms in architecture. Commerce and travel increased through the active intercourse with <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, a state of affairs beneficial to the growth of the cities. Germany grew in civilization although it did not reach the same level of culture which <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had then attained.

<p>Henry V died childless, and his nephew, Duke Frederick of Swabia, the representative of the most powerful ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the empire, hoped to be his successor. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, led by Archbishop Adalbert of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, however, feared that Frederick would continue the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy of the Franconian emperors, and they succeeded in defeating him as a candidate. At <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> the majority of the princes voted for Lothair of Supplinburg (1125-37); thus the electors disregarded any hereditary right to the throne. The Hohenstaufen brothers, Frederick and Conrad, did not yield the crown to Lothair without a struggle. The Hohenstaufen <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was in possession of the crownlands belonging to the inheritance of the Franconian emperors, and a long struggle ensued over these territories. Lothair's suzerainty was for a while in a very critical position; the Hohenstaufen power increased to such an extent that in 1127 its abettors ventured to proclaim Conrad king. In the end, however, Lothair conquered. A <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> man, but one somewhat inclined to hasty action, he was able to maintain the claims of the empire against <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. As a statesman, however, Conrad was less aggressive. He allowed the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of 1130, when <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and Anacletus Il contended for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, to pass by without turning the temporal weakness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to the benefit of the empire. After a delay Lothair finally recognized <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and brought him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here Lothir was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in 1133; but the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> did not agree to his demand for the restoration of the old right of investiture. However, he received the domains of the Countess Matilda as a fief from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and thus laid the foundation of the strong position of the house of Welf (Guelph) in Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In the meantime the two Hohenstaufen brothers were defeated, and Lothair was now able (1136), without fear of an uprising in Germany, to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a second time. The object of this further campaign in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was to defeat King Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, the protector of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, but the success of the imperial army was only temporary. Differences of opinion as to imperial and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> endangered at times the good understanding between the two great powers. The emperor grew ill and died on the way home, and after his death the vigorous Roger united all lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, into a kingdom that held an unrivalled position in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for its brilliant and strangely mixed culture. In the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire this <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> kingdom was before long to take an important part.

<p>The political policy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was directed by its distrust of the aims of the Saxon dynasty in lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; consequently by a bold stroke it brought about the election of Conrad III (1138-52), the Hohenstaufen Duke of Franconia, passing over Duke Henry the Proud, ruler of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and a descendant of Duke Welf (Guelph). The new king demanded from Henry the surrender of the Saxon duchy. Although after a long struggle the double Duchy of Bavaria-Saxony was dissolved, yet the Saxon duchy that was given by the treaty of 1142 to young Henry the Lion, son of Henry the Proud, continued a menace to the Hohenstaufen rule. Conrad was not able to put an end to the disorders in his realm, and the respect felt for the empire on the eastern frontier declined; neither was he able to assert his power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Yet all these troubles did not prevent his yielding to the fiery eloquence of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> and joining the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, the success of which had been promised by St. Bernard and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, failed completely. When Conrad returned home, broken in spirit, he was confronted by the danger of a formidable rising of the Welfs. In 1152 he died. During his reign the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> results of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> began to show themselves. Men's imaginations had been stimulated and led them away from traditional <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> sentiment. The world was seized by a romantic impulse and the conception of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, developed first among the Romanic nations, gave a Romanic colouring to the civilization and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the age. For a long time German knighthood, in particular, was characterized by Romanic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and manners.

<p>When the new king, <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I Barbarossa</a> (1152-90), ascended the throne his German kingdom seemed on the verge of disintegration, and he sought to strengthen his power by a journey through all parts of his realms. Contrary to the policy pursued by his predecessor, he exerted himself to settle the strife between the Welf (Guelph) and Hohenstaufen parties. He wanted to strengthen the Welf power to such extent as to make it evident that this party's interests coincided with those of the Crown. Besides, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, Henry the Lion received also the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> which had been taken from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Henry the Proud. As secular protector of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Frederick came to an agreement with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in regard to the latter's adversaries, the citizens of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and King Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The imperial policy of Frederick was one of vast schemes which he could only carry out when he had a firm footing in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the city republics had arisen, and these had entirely cast off his suzerainty. Not realizing the power of resistance of the free communities, Frederick wanted to force the cities to recognize the supremacy of the empire. In case the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should interfere in the dispute, Frederick was resolved not to permit his intervention in secular affairs. Frederick was filled with an ideal conception of his position as emperor. He believed that the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> were destined in the history of the world to exercise universal rule. It was this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, however, that exasperated the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and aroused their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Frederick could only carry out this universal policy if <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were his, and the question of its possession led to renewed struggles between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. When Frederick went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in 1155, most of the Italian cities paid their homage to him. On his return home <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was restored in fief to Henry the Lion, the East Mark (later <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>) being first detached from the duchy. This led in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to a development of the mark that <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of great importance for the future history of the empire. Frederick's policy was, in the main, not to interfere with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the German princes as long as they obeyed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the empire. The spiritual princes he attached closely to himself. The most powerful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this period, Rainald of Cologne, Christian of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Wichmann of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, supported the imperial party. The majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> looked upon Frederick as a protection against the encroachments of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of the secular rulers. The emperor sought, by strengthening his dynastic power, to make himself independent of both the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and temporal princes; to carry out this policy he depended on his inferior civil officials (<em>Ministerialen</em>), who were still serfs, and from whom was hereafter to come the important military nobility. Thus Frederick prepared the way for the flourishing period of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a>, which was to give its signature to the time now at hand. A romantic, knightly culture arose; poetry flourished; yet the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> lyrics of the age often expounded unhealthy views of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and marriage. Nevertheless, the movement did not penetrate very deep, and the common people remained uncorrupted. Moreover, poetry was not wasted on artificial <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> songs; Wolfram von Eschenbach had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to attempt great problems; Walther von der Vogelweide was the herald of German imperialism. Art undertook to solve great questions, and began to draw its themes from life. Scientific learning, however, had not made equal progress; the time of apprenticeship was not yet passed, while in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> had already shown itself creative. In 1158 Frederick made a second campaign in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> that closed with the sack of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the subjugation of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the flight of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When, however, the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> sided with the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the defeat of the emperor was assured, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, when supported by all other countries, could not be coerced by Frederick. The emperor's third campaign in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1162-64) ended in the failure of his lower Italian policy, and the outbreak of the plague destroyed the more promising prospects of the fourth expedition. In the fifth campaign (1174) occurred the memorable defeat near Legnano which opened the eyes of the emperor to the necessity of a treaty of peace. In 1177 he made peace with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and recognized <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, whom he had so obstinately opposed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had victoriously defended its equality with the empire. In Germany Frederick was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take steps against the violent proceedings of Henry the Lion. The insubordinate <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> was deposed and his fiefs divided, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> being given to Otto of Wittelsbach. By the repeated allotment of these lands Frederick in reality helped to break up the empire, and when in 1184 he <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> his son Henry to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, the heiress of the Norman kingdom, he prepared the way for new complications. Frederick took part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a> in order that the highest power of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> might actively fight against the infidel. He was drowned in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, 10 June, 1190; and was, at his death, a popular hero. He had greatly strengthened the feeling of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> that they were one great people, though a really national empire was at the time quite out of the question; the achievement of unity was prevented by the international character of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and partly of social, life.

<p>Frederick's son, Henry VI (1190-97), meant to establish a world power along the Mediterranean. His schemes were opposed by a Saxon-Guelphic combination headed by <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard the Lion-Hearted</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and also by the German princes, who strove to hinder the increase of the royal power aimed at by Henry. The capture of Richard in 1192 dissolved the league of princes and led to peace with the House of <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>. In 1194 Henry succeeded in conquering <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and it now seemed as though his imperialistic schemes would gain the day; nevertheless they failed owing to the opposition of the German princes and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When Henry died in 1197 the countries of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had already taken a stand against the all-embracing schemes of the German emperor. Germany was threatened by the horrors of a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. All the anti-national forces were active.

<p>Instead of the crown going to Frederick, son of Henry, who was at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, Archbishop Adolph of Cologne sought, by means of the electoral <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the princes, to obtain it for the son of Henry the Lion, <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> (1198-1215). But the Hohenstaufen party anticipated this scheme by securing the election of the popular Duke Philip of Swabia (1198-1208). For the first time the question now arose, which of the princes have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to vote? The number of electors had not, so far, been defined, yet as early as the election of Lothair and Conrad only the princes had voted, and the right of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> to preside at the election was clearly admitted. Not much later the opinion prevailed that only six ruling princes were entitled to act as electors: the three Rhenish <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a>, the Rhenish Palsgrave, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg; to these was added in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The "Sachsenspiegel" (compilation of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> law, c. 1230) caused this view to prevail. At the time of the double election of Otto and Philip the policy pursued by the German princes was a purely selfish one. The energetic <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who was then <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, claimed the right of deciding the dispute and adjudged the crown to Otto. Thus the latter for a time gained the advantage over Philip. In this conflict the German princes changed sides whenever it seemed to their interest. Archbishop Adolph of Cologne, who had carried the election of Otto, finally fell away from him. Philip gained in authority, and after the successful battle near Wassenberg in 1206 he would have overcome Otto and his ally the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, had he not been <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> in 1208 by Otto of Wittelsbach.

<p>Otto IV was now universally acknowledged king. He had promised the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to give up his claim to the domains of the Countess Matilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and to grant the free election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But when at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he refused to carry out these promises. However, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, though displeased, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him emperor in 1209. But when Otto after this wished to revive the imperial claims to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him (1210).

<p>In the meantime the supreme position of the empire had become so important a matter that foreign princes meddled in German politics. The great conflict between <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip II Augustus of France</a> and John of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was reflected in the contest between the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs and the Hohenstaufens</a> in Germany. Protected by the French and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1212-50) came to Germany and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The coalition of the English and the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> was broken by the French at the battle of Bouvines (1214), yet Otto kept up the struggle for his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> until his death in 1218. The long conflict had greatly impaired the strength of the Hohenstaufen line; both the imperial and the Hohenstaufen domains had been squandered, and the German princes had become conscious of their power. Like his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> made <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the centre of his policy; but at the same time he intended to keep the control of Germany in his own hands, as the imperial power was connected with this country and he must draw the soldiers needed for his Italian projects from Germany. In order to maintain peace in Germany and to secure the aid of the German princes for his Italian policy Frederick made great concessions to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes in the "Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis" (1220) and to the secular princes in the "Statutum in favorem principum" (1232). These two <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> became the basis of an aristocratic constitution for the German Empire. They both contained a large number of separate ordinances, which taken together might serve as a secure basis for the future sovereignty of the local princes. In these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> the expression <em>landesherr</em> (lord of the land) occurs for the first time. In this era Germany was cut up into a large number of territorial sovereignties, consisting of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territories, the duchies, which, however, were no longer tribal duchies, the margravates, among which the North Mark ruled by Albert the Bear was one of the most important, the palatinates, the countships, and the independent domains of those who had risen from landed proprietors to landed sovereigns. In addition to these were the districts ruled directly by the king through imperial wardens. What Frederick sought to get by favouring the princes he obtained. He had no real interest in Germany, which was at first ruled by the energetic Engelbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; after 1220 he visited it only once. It was to him an appendage of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Frederick's Italian policy threatened the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and he strove by concessions to avert a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The highly talented, almost learned, emperor was far in advance of his age; an autocratic ruler, he created in lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the first modern state; but by his care for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he overstrained the resources of the empire. This brought advantages to the neighbouring Kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, now long independent powers, as well as to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and the Scandinavian countries. The conflict between the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> power and the empire had aided the independent development of the states of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The possession of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to go on a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> regulated Frederick's relations with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. In 1212 he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor. Repeatedly urged to undertake the promised <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> because he failed to do so, the emperor obtained successes in the East in 1227-29, contrary to the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The silent acknowledgment of these successes by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> was a victory for Frederick. A rebellion headed by his son Henry was quickly crushed, but the confederates of Henry, the Lombards, assumed a threatening attitude. The emperor was able to bring order out of the confusion in Germany by the policy of yielding to the princes. About the same time began Frederick's struggle with the Lombards and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> (1227-41). The German princes loyally upheld the emperor, consequently, upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> death, the victory seemed to belong to the imperial party. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1243-54), however, renewed the struggle and from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the emperor, whose position now became a serious one. In Germany his son Conrad was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contend with the pretenders, Heinrich Raspe of Thuringia and William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, though, conditions seemed favourable, but just at this juncture Frederick died (13 December, 1250), and with his death ended the struggle for the world sovereignty.

<p>The year 1250 marks an era of extraordinary change in Germany. The romance of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a> passed away, and new forces directed the life of the nation. On account of the extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> changes the population rapidly increased; the majority of the people were peasants, and this class was rising, but compared with nobles and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> the peasants had no weight politically. The important factor of the new era was the municipality, and its development was the beginning of a purely German policy. The glamour of the imperial <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> had vanished, men now took their stand on facts and realities. Education found its way among <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and it developed with trade. New markets were opened for commerce. The new commercial settlements received "city charters" under the royal cross. The merchants in these settlements needed craftsmen, and these latter from the twelfth century formed themselves into guilds, thus making a new political unit. Councils elected by the cities strove to set aside the former lords of the cities, especially the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the Rhine. In vain the Hohenstaufen rulers supported the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against the independence of the towns, but the government in the cities could no longer be put down. In order to protect their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> some of the cities formed alliances, such as the confederation of the Rhenish towns, that was formed as early as the period of the Great Interregnum in order to guard the public peace. These confederations promised to become dangerous opponents of the territorial lords, but such alliances did not become general and, divided among themselves without mutual support, the smaller confederations of towns succumbed to the united princely power. The growth of the towns brought about the ruin of the system of trade by barter or in kind; the rise of the capitalistic system of commerce at once affected German views of life. Up to this time almost wholly absorbed in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, henceforth the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> took more interest in worldly things. Unconditional renunciation of the world came to an end, and men grew more matter-of-fact and practical. This change in the German way of thinking was aided by the opposition that sprang up in the towns between the citizens and the former lords of the territory, often the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Here and there the influence of the city on the views of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> manifested itself. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, at least, taught their doctrines in language quite intelligible to the people. The rise of the cities was also of importance in the social life of the day, for the principle, "City air gives freedom" (<em>Stadtluft macht frei</em>), created an entirely new class of freemen.

<p>Under the last of the Hohenstaufens the beginnings of a national culture began to appear. Latin had fallen into disuse, and German become the prevailing written language. For the first time Germany felt that she was a nation. This soon brought many Germans into opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the conflict between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire the former often seemed the opponent of nationalism, and bitterness was felt, not against the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but against its representative. The Germans still remained deeply religious, as was made evident by the German mystics.

<p>The most valuable result of this strengthening of the national feeling was the conquest of what is now the eastern part of the present German Empire. Henry I had sought to attain this end, but it was not until the thirteenth century that it was accomplished, largely by the energy of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>. The Marks of Brandenburg, <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and Silesia were colonized by Germans in a manner that challenges admiration, and German influence advanced as far as the Gulf of Finland. The centres of German civilization in these districts were the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. This extraordinary success was won by Germans in an era when the imperial government seemed ready to go to pieces. It was the period of the Great Interregnum (1256-73). We find traces of internal chaos as early as the reign of Frederick's son, Conrad IV (1250-54), and the confusion grew worse in the reign of William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and after him during the nominal reigns of <a href="../cathen/13045a.htm">Richard of Cornwall</a> and Alfonso of Castile. At the same time <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> rapidly advanced in power under Ottocar II and became a dangerous element for the domestic and foreign policy of Germany. It was <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a> who restored order in Germany. To carry out his projects in the Holy Land peace must be secured in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He therefore commissioned the electoral princes, who now appear for the first time, to elect a new king. In 1273 the princes chose Rudolf of Hapsburg (1273-91), a man of no great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> resources. Meantime the imperial power had fallen into decay; the imperial estates had been squandered; there were no imperial taxes; and the old method of obtaining soldiers for the service of the empire had broken down. Rudolf saw how <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> the possession of crown-lands was for the imperial authority, his aim being to create a dynastic force. Ottocar II, King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, sought to induce the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> to object to the election of Rudolf, but the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> had quickly come to terms with Rudolf concerning conditions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After his election he demanded from Ottocar the return of the imperial fiefs, and the refusal of the latter led to a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1276) in which, on the plain called the Marchfeld, Ottocar lost both life and crown. This victory gave Rudolf secure possession of the Austrian provinces. As the German king was not permitted to retain vacant fiefs, he evaded this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by granting <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, Carniola, and Lusatia in fief to his sons Albert and Rudolf; in this way the power of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was greatly increased. Not even Rudolf thought of strengthening the kingly power by constitutional means. He decided to protect the public peace but did not entirely succeed in this. His policy was always influenced by the circumstances of the moment: at one time he favoured the princes, at another the cities; consequently he was never more than half successful. His only great achievement was that he secured for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> a position in Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> that was destined to give it importance in the future.

<p>Rudolf's successor was Adolf of Nassau (1292-98), not his son Albert, as he had desired. The policy of the new sovereign was to weaken <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, his natural opponent. Like Rudolf he recognized the necessity of obtaining possessions for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, for which he tried to lay a foundation in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. Adolf's success against Frederick the Degenerate of Thuringia caused the electoral princes to incline to Albert. In a battle near Goellheim, fought between Albert and Adolf, Albert, aided by Adolf's numerous enemies, defeated the king, who was killed.

<p>Albert I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, a very able but morose man (1298-1308), was filled with a boundless <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> for power. Without regard for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of others, he enforced the recognition of his own <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in his duchy. He desired to preserve the public peace in Germany and opposed the cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> customary at this time. He also wished to reorganize the imperial lands, which were to be regained in such a way as to provide a connecting link between the territories of the Hapsburgs in the east and those in the west. If his lands were thus united he would be a match for the strongest of the territorial princes; but the latter opposed this scheme. Albert also roused the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> electors by combining with <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">King Philip IV</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, who had not recognized Albert. <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> now declared his intention of summoning Albert before his tribunal for the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Adolf. Supported by the cities, Albert contended successfully with the Rhenish electors, but after a while, in order to carry out his plans for the aggrandizement of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he came to terms with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and this put an end to the opposition of these electors. The only opponent of his dynastic schemes now to be dreaded was Wenceslaus II of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; but the Przemysl line soon died out, and Albert at once claimed their lands and gave them to his son Rudolf as a fief. Before he could carry out his designs on Thuringia he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by John of Swabia, called Johannes Parricida. According to legend, the tyranny of his rule in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> led to a great struggle for freedom on the part of the confederated <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>. The aim pursued by Albert was always the same: by making <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> powerful to force the other sovereign princes to acknowledge his suzerainty and thus to make the crown hereditary in his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. It is, therefore, not a matter of surprise that after his death the electors decided to select a less mighty prince.

<p>Archbishop Baldwin of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> managed the matter so skillfully that his brother Henry of Luxembourg (L&uuml;tzelburg) was chosen (1308-13). A man of gentle, amiable character, Henry was full of visionary enthusiasm, but withal he was a man of energy; consequently he was soon very popular. By birth he was in sympathy with the French. German interests concerned him less. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had a great fascination for him; he was ambitious to receive the imperial crown, to be the first after a long interregnum. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> had recognized him. The <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> greeted him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. At first he sought to hold a neutral position in the quarrels of the Italian parties, but this proved to be impossible. The <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, led by King Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, began to oppose him. When Henry thereupon wished to attack <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the old conflict with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> again broke out, but death suddenly ended his imperial dreams. Henry's only successful act was the marriage of his son John with the heiress of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Elizabeth, the sister of Wenceslaus III; for Germany his reign <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of no advantage. The election of his son John to succeed him was impossible, and the Luxembourg party chose Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> (1314-47) in opposition to Frederick the Fair (1314-30). There was a double election, each of the candidates being elected by one party, and a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out, confined, however, mainly to the partisans of the two Houses of Wittelsbach and Hapsburg. The struggle was ended by the capture of Frederick at the battle of M&uuml;hldorf (1322); after this Louis was universally recognized.

<p>While this conflict was going on the old strife between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> again broke out. At the time of the double election <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an administrator of the country. He asserted that no king chosen by the electors could exercise authority before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given his approval. This over-straining of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims roused a dissatisfaction which continually grew and to which were already added complaints of the worldliness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> placed at the disposal of the king eloquent preachers to denounce the worldliness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, which had rejected as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> teaching concerning the poverty of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. In 1324 Louis was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> because he had not obeyed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> command to lay down his authority. To this Louis made a sharp reply in the proclamation of Sachsenhausen, in which he denied the claims of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and at the same time defended the teaching concerning poverty upheld by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. In the conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who supported the candidature of Charles IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the imperial throne, the German cities and the German episcopate, the latter led by Baldwin of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, were virtually a unit on the side of Louis. Even the death of Frederick the Fair did not produce a reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. It was at this juncture that the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> and <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a> began to exert their influence. The spirit of revolution in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is shown by the "Defensor Pacis" of <a href="../cathen/09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a>, a professor of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> who went to the Court of Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>. In this the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> system is attacked. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> ferment enabled Louis to undertake an expedition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He had been invited to enter <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the magnates of northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially by the Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the Scala of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. The city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> received him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and he was the first German king to receive the imperial crown from the Roman commonwealth which had always regarded itself as the source of all sovereignty. But the fickle populace soon drove him away; the means at his command were too small to carry out the old imperial policy. Again <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was lost. Notwithstanding the lack of success in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Germany in the main held to Louis, who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> again. It was now evident that <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">papal interdicts</a> had largely lost their terrors; the civil communities frequently paid no attention to them, and in some places <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were forced, notwithstanding the prohibition, to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. The growth of a worldly spirit in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began to undermine respect for it, and Germany was the first country to turn against the ideals of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">Sects</a> opposed to sacerdotalism appeared; <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> tended to make the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> independent in its progress towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without, however, rejecting the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as was done by some in this era. Yet, unintentionally, <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> strengthened the tendency to deny the absolute necessity of the intercessory office of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> gave a national cast to German <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> leaders of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, Ekkehard, <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, wrote and preached in German. The chief strength of this religious movement was among the citizens of the towns. In the conflict between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> the cities sided with the emperor, but they were not yet strong enough without assistance to maintain the authority of a German emperor. Consequently, the position taken by the German princes was decisive for Louis. As he meant to carry on a dynastic policy, as his predecessors had done, he soon came into conflict with these princes, and, in order to be stronger than his opponents, he sought to establish friendly relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But although Louis could resolve on vigorous action, yet he lacked the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> persistence. He was not an able man, nor one of much <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> power. He tried to make a good impression on every one; as a consequence, he failed with all parties. He opened negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, but the intrigues of Philip VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> kept the two parties from concluding peace. This led Louis to take the side of <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III of England</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the French and English for the succession to the French throne. This stand won more general sympathy for Louis in Germany. The electors were also influenced by public opinion when they declared at Rense in 1338 that a legitimate German emperor could be created only by their votes; a king so chosen needed no <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> recognition, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by crowning the German king, only gave him the imperial title. Louis was also declared to be entirely without blame in the dispute with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. When <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> appeared before Louis at Coblenz and the latter appointed him imperial vicar for the territories beyond the Rhine, the emperor had reached the zenith of his power. Nevertheless the fickle Louis, because he hoped, through the mediation of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to be reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and to secure the support of the latter for his schemes to aggrandize his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, allied himself with the French in 1341. Instead of peace a worse estrangement with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court was the result.

<p>With the consent of the emperor, Margaret Maultasch of Tyrol, who had married John of Luxembourg (L&uuml;tzelburg), had <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> herself without awaiting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision and married the emperor's son, Louis of Brandenburg. The Luxembourg party at once had recourse to <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>. Louis was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in 1346, and Charles IV of Moravia (1347-78) was, with the help of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, chosen German king by five of the electors under humiliating conditions. At first Louis had strong support from the German cities, but his unexpected death secured universal recognition for Charles. Henceforth for nearly a hundred years the Luxembourg-Bohemian dynasty held the throne. The king set up by the Wittelsbach party, Guenther of Schwarzburg, could make no headway against the adroit policy of Charles IV. In 1347 Germany was ravaged by the Black Death; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were immediately accused of poisoning the wells, and a frightful <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> followed. In the midst of the confusion the country was traversed by bands of <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>, and these "penitents" were often full of hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. While in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> and Cola di Rienzi revived the dream of the universal dominion of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, Charles IV regarded Italian affairs with the eyes of a political realist. The <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> said that he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1355) to secure the imperial crown like a merchant going to a fair. In Germany Charles sought to settle the election to the crown at the Diets of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and Metz in 1356, and he issued the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which was the first attempt to put into writing the more important stipulations of the imperial constitution. Above all, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was intended to regulate the election of the king, and defined what princes should have the electoral vote. The electoral college was to consist of the three <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Cologne; the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony (Sachsen-Wittenberg), and the Margrave of Brandenburg; to this number was added later the King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The electors were granted special privileges; besides the royal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> (<em>regalia</em>) and those of taxation and <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, they received the <em>privilegium de non evocando</em>, that is, their subjects could not be summoned before the court of another <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, not even before an imperial one. The royal authority was to find in the electors who were scattered throughout the empire a support against the many petty princes. Other articles of the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> were to guard the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the local princes against their vassals and subjects, especially against the cities. Nothing is said of the share of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the election of the king; the one chosen by the majority of the electors was to be the king. Only the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> as emperor was left to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> remained the most important part of the fundamental law of the Holy Roman Empire.

<p>Learning flourished under the rule of Charles, who was a scholar among his contemporaries. He was surrounded by highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> men, one of whom was John of Neumarkt, the head of his chancelry. His interest being almost entirely in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, he showed his care for the advancement of learning chiefly in this country and founded there, 7 April, 1348, the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>. Charles held steadfastly to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Christian Scholasticism</a>. But this did not prevent him from carrying on policies independent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In reorganizing the imperial chancelry he encouraged the use of German in the imperial documents and thus assured the victory of the national tongue over Latin. By this action he gave German learning an independent standing.

<p>Charles also furthered the interests of the empire in various other directions. He did not, indeed, overthrow the power of the princes, which had grown strong during the several hundred years of its existence, but he sought by the maintenance of internal peace to preserve his supreme power. To promote the foreign interests of Germany he desired to liberate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from its connexion with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and to persuade the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to return from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory</a> went back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">Babylonian Captivity</a> was to be followed by the Great Schism. In the meantime, Charles had largely increased the territorial possession of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; the Marks of Brandenburg, Lusatia, and Silesia came into his hands. By marriage he hoped to obtain for his son, and thus for his dynasty, both <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Thus for a time the House of Luxembourg threatened to crash out the Hapsburgs. In two directions only Charles's adroit agreements and diplomatic skill failed of success. The <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederation seceded more and more completely from the empire, and the cities by their leagues established for themselves an independent position in the empire. Towards the end of his life he secured the election of his son Wenceslaus as German king.

<p>Wenceslaus (1378-1400) reigned without the confirmation of the defenceless <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of that time. The German crown was no longer dependent on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Other questions far more important than this were now brought into the foreground by the Great Schism. There was a continually growing clamour, which could not be suppressed, for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in its head and members. The demand for reform had infused new life into the whole conception of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the leaders of this movement still held to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. The most difficult task of the new king, and one he did not shirk, was to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. He sided with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and supported <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> while <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at the head of the Romanic countries, upheld <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. Wenceslaus, however, took no energetic action in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs; the internal disorder in Germany did not permit it, for here the confederations of princes, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, and the cities, struggled with one another. In 1381 the confederation of the Rhenish cities formed a coalition with the league of the Swabian cities and sought with considerable success to obtain the adherence of other Swabian towns and of those of North Germany. Thus strengthened, the cities wished to share in the government of the empire; this desire was opposed by the princes who in military force were superior to the cities. The attempts of the rulers of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederates failed, but in Germany the army of the Swabian League suffered a crushing defeat in 1388 near Doeffingen. After this Wenceslaus changed his policy and sided with the princes. Confederations of the cities were forbidden. Owing to their lack of union the cities succumbed in this contest for political independence and the territorial princes were the conquerors. The quick-tempered, irascible king sought to strengthen his hold on his hereditary provinces by protecting himself against the other ruling princes, but in this he was not successful. A government by favouritism of the worst kind began which excited the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the nobility and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. A dispute with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> led to the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, by the king's command, of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, John of Pomuk, and this caused open rebellion. In 1394 the nobles with Jost, Margrave of Moravia, as their leader, took the king <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>; he was soon set free at the instance of the German princes, but his release did not do away with the rule of the nobility in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. In this era of confusion no attempt was made to oppose the repeated incursions (1388) of Charles VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> into Germany. Wenceslaus looked on inactively when the French king undertook to carry out a scheme for putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by securing the success of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by a bold stroke; but in 1392 Charles VI became insane, and his plans were brought to nought. The waning influence of the German Empire was everywhere perceptible and called forth universal indignation. The king's lack of capacity for government led the majority of the electors to form a league for the protection of the interests of the country.

<p>Soon after this the three episcopal electors chose Ruprecht, Count Palatine of the Rhine, as King of Germany (1400-10). As only a part of the electors joined in this choice Ruprecht was never more than a pretender, and although he was an ambitious and capable man he never succeeded in uniting the empire. Ruprecht hoped to gain popularity by restoring German influence in northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and by securing the imperial crown to prove himself the legal sovereign. As Ruprecht had no money, his expedition to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was inglorious, and its failure had a bad effect on his position in Germany. Even his final recognition by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had for a long time held to the Luxembourg dynasty, his faithful supporters, did little to aid Ruprecht's cause, and his throne began to totter. In 1405 Archbishop Johann of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> combined the princes against Ruprecht in the League of Marbach which, however, accomplished next to nothing. In the question of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> Ruprecht supported <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>. As King of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> Ruprecht was a failure. During the laxity of government that followed his death the German conquests in the eastern part of the empire were in danger of being lost. A new factor had appeared in history, the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>.

<p>All this time the confusion in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had continued to grow worse, and it was now proposed to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by means of a council. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the two rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> called a council at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> which deposed Popes <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and elected <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a> and Benedict could still count on some supporters, and the world thus saw three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The greater part of Germany held to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>, but the party of the Count Palatine and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> held to <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a>. A period of utter confusion and great distress of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> followed; all the relations of life suffered, the political by no means the least. In Germany the troubles led to a double election; Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, the brother of Wenceslaus was elected (1410-37), as was also Jost, Margrave of Moravia. Jost withdrew, and Wenceslaus resigned the government to Sigismund, who in 1411 was generally recognized as emperor. The impotence of the last reign convinced the electors, who had chosen Margrave Jost for reasons of Church politics, that a king who had not large territorial power could accomplish nothing. Consequently they dropped their opposition to Sigismund. The latter's life before his election had been a very eventful one. He had married the daughter and heiress of Louis the Great of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and had been <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king of that country in 1387. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> he had been completely defeated by Sultan Bajazet; after this he had to contend with a dangerous rebellion in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Sigismund was talented, eloquent, witty, and exceedingly ambitious; he was inclined to visionary schemes, but he honestly desired to relieve the woeful troubles of his time. In his hereditary dominions, to which <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was now added, there was great disorder. Yet notwithstanding this he succeeded in bringing together the great councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle. Ambition led him to attempt to settle the difficulties in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was involved, but he was also impelled by political considerations. He hoped that a council would aid him in suppressing the religious troubles kindled in his hereditary kingdom of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> by <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a>. It was not <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, which inspired his interest in the council, as is evident from the general bent of his mind. For with all his interest in literature and learning, Sigismund scrupulously avoided involving himself in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> difficulties; moreover he took pleasure in denouncing the faults of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Nevertheless it was Sigismund's energy that held together the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">great council at Constance</a>. It was certainly not his fault that many were not satisfied with the result of this and the following council. The forcible interference of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in the religious difficulties of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and the burning of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> were injurious to Sigismund's dynastic interests, and not in accordance with his political schemes. In <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> at once strove to prevent the king from taking possession of these countries; and it, especially in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, was a violent religious and national outbreak. The king was held directly responsible for the burning of the national hero and saint. Fanatical hordes led by Ziska repeatedly overthrew Sigismund's army in his <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, and the storm spread over the adjacent provinces of the empire. <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Franconia, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, and Silesia were terribly devastated. The imperial government broke down completely. The selfishness of the cities prevented the reform of the German military system, even after its necessity had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by further successes of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. In 1427 an imperial law for the levying of a war-tax was laid before the Diet at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a>, but it was never carried out.

<p>In addition to the troubles in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Sigismund's already insecure position was made more precarious by a fresh invasion of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The only help he received was from Duke Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, his son-in-law and the prospective heir of the great inheritance of the Luxembourg possessions. The jealousy among the German states prevented common action against both foes. Sigismund's chief <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, after the reunion and reformation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to unite all the nations of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, became more and more hopeless. The defeat of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> appeared equally impossible, and negotiations were opened with them, peace being finally arranged at Basle. Sigismund induced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to weaken in his attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> theory, and especially to the Council of Basle which was to deal with the Hussite difficulties. To gain his point he had gone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in 1433. Even in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> where the existing <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> had been increased by a new religious quarrel, where the moderate Calixtines had obtained a decisive victory over the Taborites under Procopius the Great in 1434, the need of peace grew more and more intense. The year previous to this, 1433, a commission of the Council of Basle had made a number of concessions to the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> in the Compact of Basle or of Prague; among these was the granting of the Cup to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. On the basis of the Compact a peace was agreed to, which was followed by the recognition (1436) of Sigismund as king in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. When this was attained Sigismund seemed to lose all concern for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and empire in which before he had shown so keen and active an interest. He can hardly be blamed for the boundless selfishness and jealousy of the princes repeatedly wrecked the work of reform; and the whole responsibility for the scanty gains for the empire achieved during his reign should not be laid on his shoulders. Only two of his measures were to have permanent existence: the transfer of the Mark of Brandenburg to the Hohenzollerns, and the granting of electoral Saxony to the House of Wettin. The great councils passed without bringing the fervently desired reform. Great changes were witnessed in these assemblies. At Basle the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was regarded simply as a representative of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the superiority of the council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was openly declared. In 1433 Procopius had been allowed to enter Basle at the head of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> followers and to set forth his opinions before the assembled members of the council without molestation. At Basle opinions which were signs of a revolutionary movement in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> repeatedly appeared. In character this council differed entirely from all earlier ones; the excitement was so great that tumults and brawls occurred. Contrary to the wishes of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the council remained at Basle; the fear was that if it were transferred to Italian soil the work of reform would be forgotten. Yet the honest intentions of the majority of the members cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. In the end the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was victorious, and the council was transferred to <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Some of the members remained at Basle and the spectacle of a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was offered to the world.

<p>In this troubled era Albert II (1438-39), Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, was chosen emperor. The electors recognized the fact that the centre of gravity of the empire now lay towards the east. Albert, member of the Hapsburg <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, had not put himself forward as a candidate, and the electors probably selected him through fear that the important and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> eastern territories might fall away from the empire. Before he could come to Western Germany Albert, a rough soldier, died during a campaign against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>.

<p>The election now went to the head of the Hapsburg <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the inert and indolent Frederick III, who, as King of the Romans, was Frederick IV (1440-93). During his reign the work of reform in the empire fell completely into abeyance. He too was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to face the difficulties in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The electors had decided to remain neutral in the dispute between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Council of Basle, but this neutrality had been broken, inasmuch as the Diet of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1439 accepted the reform <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Basle, with exception of the assertion of the superiority of the council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Henceforth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were to be elected canonically, but the king had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to secure the election of suitable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by negotiation. Papal reservations and annates were abolished. The Council of Basle, however, held firmly to its exaggerated conception of the powers of a council, and its members wished to establish the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> superiority by deposing <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a>. In this dispute the electors remained neutral. The reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was more and more lost sight of by the Council of Basle in its struggle with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Frederick, who was appealed to by both <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Basle, at first remained neutral; then he proposed the calling of a new council to <a href="../cathen/15132a.htm">reunite divided Christianity</a>. Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> gradually turned again to the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> elected at Basle, <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, received but slight recognition. For a time the German attitude of neutrality was maintained, but after a while Frederick gave the impulse to the universal recognition of <a href="../cathen/05598a.htm">Pope Eugene</a>. This was brought about by Aeneas Sylvius, later <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, an adroit diplomat who was able to influence the king and the leading princes. An agreement was made with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Concordat of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1448) in which the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> made but trifling concessions, while the question of reform received scant consideration. From now on the Synod of Basle, transferred to Lausanne, had only a shadowy existence. The <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, although sorely pressed, had once more conquered. The general anxiety to avoid a new <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had far more to do with the settlement of these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> troubles than the interference of Frederick. Moreover Frederick showed his lack of skill in other ways. In 1444 the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> at the battle of St. Jakob on the Birs, not far from Basle, by their extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> defeated his French mercenaries, called Armagnacs, and thus frustrated his schemes for restoring the control of the Hapsburgs over the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> League. In spite of the constant disorders in the empire and the frequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, Frederick never wavered in his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the future greatness of the Hapsburg dynasty. It was this confidence that in 1452 led him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the last German king to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Directly afterwards came the capture of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the emperor to take up arms for the defence of the eastern frontier of his realm. Yet he could neither maintain peace within the empire nor its most important <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Luxembourg and the possessions of the Wittelsbach <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> fell into the hands of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, the Poles annexed West <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and the remnant of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> in East Prussia was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize the suzerainty of the Polish king. Thus the Germanizing influences that had been at work for centuries in what is now the eastern part of the German Empire were destroyed.

<p>The complete breakdown of the power of the empire called forth the demand that the emperor should be either deposed or have a coadjutor, but the lack of harmony among the electors prevented any change. The clamour for internal reform grew louder, but nothing was done except to enact <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the maintenance of the public peace. During this confusion Frederick's position in his hereditary possessions became very precarious. The Czechs had held the preponderating power in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> ever since the time of the Hussite troubles and now elected George of Podiebrad as king. The Hungarians also chose a ruler for themselves, electing the hero of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias I Corvinus</a>. <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> soon overthrew the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king, and in 1487 apparently intended to form a great kingdom by uniting the eastern German provinces with the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravian</a>, and Hungarian territories. Important changes also occurred in the northern part of Germany. The Counts of Holstein, who had carried the German nationality into the northern territory of what is now Germany, had received Schleswig as early as 1386 in fief from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>; the two provinces, Holstein and Schleswig, soon grew together. After the death of the last Count of Holstein, King Christian of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was in 1460 elected duke by Schleswig and Holstein. In this way he became a prince of the empire, a point of importance in the near future. This was afterwards to influence the position of the Baltic countries and the German interests there. For centuries the centre of the empire had been in the south, and Germany had no maritime interests. In this case also, as in the Germanization of the east, self-help was the means of attaining the desired end. The Hanseatic League, a union of German mercantile guilds, rapidly extended from Cologne to Reval on the Gulf of Finland. From the middle of the thirteenth century the chief towns of the League were Luebeck and <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. German commerce flourished on all waters, for the members of the League carried the fame of their country across all the seas surrounding the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> of that day. It is in fact a striking phenomenon that the national feeling was invigorated, while the strength of the empire was weakened by the division into so many petty sovereignties. The Hanseatic League maintained its ascendency in the Baltic as late as the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

<p>At the same time a great power threatened to spring up in the west. By peaceful agreement Charles the Bold, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (1467-77), attempted to secure Frederick's consent to his election as King of the Romans and to the elevation of his possessions to the rank of an independent kingdom. But all these ambitious plans came to an end upon the death of Charles at the battle of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> in 1477. The duke's possessions fell to Louis XI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, while Maximilian, son of the Emperor Frederick and son-in-law of Charles the Bold, hastened to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, which he secured for himself (1479) by the brilliant battle at Guinegate. He was not, however, able to make himself master of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Artois. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> was not willing to submit to the new regime and it was not until 1489 that it was completely subdued. Somewhat later, on the death of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a> in 1490, Maximilian's energetic action gained for his dynasty the future possession of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, while at the same time he reunited the Tyrol with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Consequently when the old emperor died, all looked to the knightly hero Maximilian for the restoration of the empire.

<p>Thus the outlook was by no means unfavourable at the time Maximilian I (1493-1519) ascended the throne. There were even indications of a healthier condition of internal affairs. The Swabian League, made up of the free cities and of the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, sought, especially in 1486, to effect an adjustment of those interests of the different estates which most threatened the existence of the empire. Another favourable sign was the rapid development in civilization and culture of the several principalities. No less promising was the decision of the electors, now that the imperial authority had shown its entire impotence to check further decentralization. Turbulent agitation for reform in the cities was another important indication in the same direction. Maximilian tried by vigorous reforms to win the good will of the cities, the aid of which would be essential to him in the expected <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but the obstacles to be overcome before reforms could be introduced seemed steadily to increase. The most serious difficulty was and remained the antagonism between the interests of the empire and those of the princes. Maximilian, with his dynastic resources, which were made up of very heterogeneous elements, was not able to overcome these opposing forces. Thus the Diet of Worms in 1495 could not do much to promote reform on account of the opposing interests of the ruling princes, the free <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the empire, and the imperial cities. At this diet the "Universal Pacification of the Empire" was proclaimed. All private <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> were forbidden. An Imperial Chamber was established as a perpetual supreme court for the maintenance of the public peace, and the appointments to it were made by the emperor and the Estates of the empire. So many matters, however, were turned over to this court that it was condemned to inactivity from the outset. Nor was the Imperial Chamber able to promote the public peace, as it lacked all power of enforcing its decrees. Order in the empire could not be attained until the subordinate rulers became strong enough to exercise a vigorous police power in their territories. Maximilian had only agreed to the establishment of this court on condition that a general imperial tax, "the common penny," and military help against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> should be promised him. Concessions of a very different character had also been demanded by the ruling princes from the king. The powerful <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/02520b.htm">Berthold of Henneberg</a>, was the first to express the opinion that the administration of the empire should be placed in the hands of the electors, without, however, doing away with the monarchy. This proposition of the Diet of Worms was rejected by Maximilian. Five years later, however, when the promised financial and military aid was not forthcoming, he consented to the appointment of a permanent Imperial Council at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>. If this council had maintained an active existence for any length of time the king would have become a mere puppet. But after two years the royal power <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> strong enough to break down the unnatural limitations imposed on it by the Estates.

<p>During these constitutional struggles within the empire the hostile feeling between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Germany continued to grow. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, now greatly increased in power, wished to gain a firm foothold in the Italian peninsula, and put forward claims to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Thus began the long struggle of the Hapsburg dynasty with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the possession of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Maximilian was unable to checkmate the Italian schemes of the French king. In the end Maximilian even changed his policy, for, in order to gain assistance against <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he allied himself with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Yet even now he reaped no laurels in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the Swabian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> also, which the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederated cantons carried on against the Swabian League, his intervention was unsuccessful. As a matter of fact Maximilian was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, in the Treaty of Basle (1501), to acknowledge the independence of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederation. In the course of these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> had become enthusiastic soldiers, and after this <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> could furnish or refuse entire armies of mercenaries, in this way attaining <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> importance in the great struggle of the Hapsburgs with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The work of reform in the empire, however, came to a complete standstill on account of these unsuccessful foreign undertakings. The only permanent result of all these efforts was the Imperial Chamber. The course of history could not be reversed: the territorial development of the separate states had been too <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> to allow its reversal. A strengthening of the central administration, the preliminary condition for a reform of the empire, was no longer possible. In 1508 Maximilian had assumed the title of "Elected Roman Emperor," thus proclaiming that the imperial dignity was independent of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation. Restlessly active, he staked everything on the success of those foreign policies that would strengthen his royal power. It was for this reason that he finally returned to his earlier course of action and joined the Holy League against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The brilliant success of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> over the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> at Marignano (1515) forced Maximilian to agree to a peace by which the French received <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> obtained <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. In the meantime various imperial diets again took up the question of reform, but the whole reform movement failed entirely, and the separate states gained a complete victory over the central administration. At Maximilian's death practically nothing had been accomplished for the constitution of the empire.

<p>Political and cultural life followed the course of development we have described, the foci being in the several states. Among these states the most prominent were the electoral principalities, which had been granted special honours and privileges by the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. The three Rhenish electors were the most important political personages. Saxony was much increased in size by the addition of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>. It would have become the leading state of northern Germany had not its territories been divided in 1485 between the Albertine and Ernestine branches of the ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The Electoral Mark of Brandenburg, acquire in 1417 by the Hohenzollerns, was still in the beginnings of its growth. The Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> had almost entirely estranged <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> from the empire. The Palatinate of the Rhine, always a home of culture, was still one of its centres. The Duchies of Brunswick-Lueneburg and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> were also prominent. In 1495 the able Counts of Wirtemberg (W&uuml;rtemberg) received Countship of Swabia, which was raised to a duchy. Baden grew into a principality more slowly. More rapid was the development of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, whose sovereigns under the title of Landgraves, were soon to come into prominence. The future of the empire depended on these minor states. The empire lacked imperial civil officials, imperial taxes, an imperial army, a general and systematized administration of imperial <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, while in these subordinate states there arose a defined government, a centralization of the civil officials, a systematic administration of law. This is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Maxmilian's hereditary possessions, the Austrian provinces. The leaders of progress in this respect also were the imperial cities, in which <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life began to flourish. In art they produced an <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">Albrecht D&uuml;rer</a> and the two <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbeins</a>. A darker side, however, was not lacking to this brilliant city life. Bloody outbreaks were often caused by a restless proletariat. Dissatisfaction was also rife among the free <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the empire who had lost their former importance in consequence of the change in the military system, which had again made infantry the decisive element in battle. Moreover discontent was at work among the peasantry. The <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> became robber-knights and highwaymen. Though banned by the empire, Franz von Sickingen, without authority, carried on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the city of Worms. The <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> changes had even more ruinous consequences for the peasantry. The age of discovery, of the growth of commerce, and of the great inventions, is also the age in which capital made its appearance as the great power of the world. There was a change in the value of money which brought severe suffering upon the peasantry which was despised and politically without <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, especially in the thickly populated southern part of Germany. Communistic writings appeared, which discussed the position of the peasants. The unrest increased in Franconia, Swabia, and on the upper Rhine, and revolts occurred. It was proposed to found a <a href="../cathen/04179a.htm">communistic</a> kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all hopes were placed on a strong emperor. Mixed with these desires was the expectation of a thorough reform of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs concerning which dissatisfaction was loudly expressed.

<p>The social-religious restlessness continually increased. The period of political confusion had not passed by without leaving its impress on the German character. The brilliant exterior of life covered but thinly the brutality within. There was widespread evidence of the lack of morality in domestic life, of barbarity in the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and of inhumanity in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continually decreased, although a rich and voluminous religious literature had been disseminated by the art of printing. Great preachers, like <a href="../cathen/06403c.htm">Geiler von Kaysersberg</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, also appeared at this time. The <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brethren of the Common Life</a> took for their ideal the abnegation of the world. But all this failed to prevent the decline of the authoritative influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the life of the people. The Great Schism had severely shaken the position of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The common people were estranged from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A craving for religious self-help arose, and religious movements antagonistic to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> won large followings. German learning loosened the bond that up to then had united it to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. A new <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement disputed the dominance of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, &AElig;neas Sylvius, and <a href="../cathen/07010a.htm">Gregor von Heimburg</a> prepared the way for <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> ideals having apparently lost their attraction, men turned to others, which advocated the world and its pleasures in opposition to self-abnegation, and instead of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> universalism preached the freedom of the individual.

<p>In the second half of the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> entered Germany in order to break down here as it had done in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the absolute domination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conception of the world. But <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> in Germany assumed an entirely different form. In Germany the end sought was not beauty of form in learning, art, and life; here it manifested, rather, a practical, pedagogical, and, finally, religious tendency. Aided by the art of printing, <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> by its delight in experiment and induction, roused other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> to fresh life, such as the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history and especially the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Individualism, moreover, strengthened the national sentiment and was a powerful force in overthrowing <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> universalism, and in putting an end to the ideal of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval world</a>, the universality of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. At the close of Maximilian's reign the signs of the times were undoubtedly very threatening, yet closer investigation shows that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was still powerful. Notwithstanding the turning away of many from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, there were still men in Germany who were filled with this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. These men did not conceal from themselves the necessity of genuine moral reform. The same power and intensity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> feeling that had built the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was still alive in the more serious minded part of the nation. Only the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> few carried these feelings over into the succeeding age, and with them the certain expectation of the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from within.
<h2 id="section2">From 1556 to 1618</h2>

<p>After the death of Maximilian I the two great competitors for the imperial crown were <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a>, Maximilian's grandson. Notwithstanding the opposition of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and the alienation of French sympathies, the choice of the electors fell on <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> (28 June, 1519), who was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> as <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, on 23 October, 1520, and by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> at Bologna, on 23 February, 1530. In January, 1521, he opened the Diet of Worms and his administration of the Holy Roman Empire lasted until his abdication. In 1556 <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> resigned the imperial throne. This act implied a serious break in the continuity of the political and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of the German people. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles's</a> reign had lasted for more than a generation, but only an insignificant part of it had been devoted to Germany. His attention had been mainly given to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Consequently from 1520 the defection from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had made more and more rapid headway, in spite of the emperor's prohibitory edicts issued at the Diet of Worms (1521) and at the Diet of Augsburg (1530), and shortly after 1540 this apostasy threatened to affect the whole of Germany. At the same time the separatist tendencies of the ruling princes increased in strength. It was not until towards the end of his reign that <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> took measures to check the princes of the empire. By the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in Gelderland (1543), the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (1547), and the Smalkaldic War (1546-47), he succeeded in bringing the triumphant career of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> to a standstill, thus saving the greater part of western and southern Germany to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Driven from these territories <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> overran, during the following decades, the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and Bohemian-Austrian provinces in the south-east. But even there it was not able to maintain itself. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> did not succeed in forcing the princes to return to their proper position in the empire and to subordination to the emperor. The most important of the princes were the rulers of the northern states; these were in no wise affected by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles's</a> military successes, as he did not push his operations as far as northern Germany. The Dukes of Saxon and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> also, who were friendly to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> and took part in his campaigns, suffered no curtailment of their power. The partial failure of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> determined the future development of the empire, the basis of which was laid down in the recess of the Imperial Diet of 1555. By it, in the so-called Religious Peace of Augsburg, Germany was divided between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the adherents of the Augsburg Confession, and the territorial princes were practically made the political arbiters of the empire. The principle, <em>cujus regio, ejus religio</em>, was recognized. The Imperial Chamber (<em>Reichskammergericht</em>) was subjected to the influence of the Estates of the empire. In the newly instituted system of administration by "circles" also, the control of the emperor was no longer permitted. Further, the permanent council of administration (<em>Reichsdeputationstag</em>), an organ of centralization developed in 1558 from the system of "circles," was summoned and presided over by the Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> as chancellor of the empire and not by the emperor. Economical and judicial legislation devolved on the separate states. At the Diet of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> (1570) the princes annulled the supreme authority of the emperor in military matters.

<p>These events implied not only a change in the government of the empire, so that it was controlled by the electors and not by the emperor, but the empire itself became almost a shadow incapable of great administrative actions. Its constitutional powers waned; diets were seldom convoked (only ten up to 1618), the decisions of the Imperial Chamber were not carried out, the administration by "circles" did not take root. The empire failed just as signally, as a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> power, in maintaining its interests during the great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the reign of Philip II in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, an exception being the Pacification of Cologne (1579), which sought to restore order in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, but to which little heed was paid. Not even the boundaries of the empire were maintained. From about 1580 the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> established themselves in the Rhine provinces and Emden, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> sought in addition to obtain Alsace. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> entangled as many of the south-western sections of the empire as possible in its intrigues, especially the city of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> married his daughter to the Elector Palatine. On the Baltic coast the Swedes, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, and Poles despoiled the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> of the more distant territories colonized by them, while the Danes settled in the south-west corner of the Baltic. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> overthrew the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> supremacy of the Hanseatic League in the Baltic Sea and German Ocean. On the Danube the Hapsburgs were compelled to buy an armistice with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> by the payment of tribute. The blame for the helpless condition of the empire rested principally on the reigning princes. They took no interest in its affairs, not because they were lacking in German sentiment, but because the horizon of their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> was still too restricted, and because either they gave little thought to politics or their attention was absorbed by the details of administration within their own dominions. The governmental organization of their principalities was still very imperfect. The conservation and gradual development of their territories engrossed the energies of the princes, especially of the most powerful among them, the Elector Augustus of Saxony (1553-86) and Duke Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1550-89). They, therefore, avoided <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> above all things. The only alliance among them that had any stability at that time, the "Landsberg League" of southern Germany (1556-90), had, for its sole object, the maintenance of peace.

<p>The emperors of this period, Ferdinand I (1556-64), Maximilian II (1564-76), Rudolf II (1576-1612), and Matthias (1612-19), not only failed to arouse the princes to a more intelligent treatment of the affairs of the empire, but by their own policy they encouraged the princes to pursue purely personal ends. For, unlike <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> who had ruled a world-empire, his successors governed territories, the political importance of which barely exceeded that of the majority of German states, and which only surpassed these latter in extent. Accordingly, as none of them were men of pre-eminent ability, their political aims were narrow, their need of peace urgent, and their credit inadequate, while the credit of the western powers had largely developed since the time of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. Moreover they had harder conditions to face in their own dominions than the other princes. Most of their territories were in the eastern part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> where, from the end of the fifteenth century, the landed petty nobles, who formed a large class, opposed with ever-increasing success the progress of the commonalty and the introduction of orderly administration under the control of the sovereign. With this inferior nobility in the dominions of the German Hapsburgs, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who attracted to themselves all the opposing elements, made common cause. Thus the emperors were by degrees so harassed in their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> possessions that, towards the end of Rudolf's reign, the power fell into the hands of the nobility, and Matthias, though advised by his able minister <a href="../cathen/08666b.htm">Cardinal Klesl</a>, was hardly able to maintain his authority.

<p>In the period from 1556 to 1618 the only general movement in the inner politics of the empire, and one that caused important changes in the relative influence of the German rulers, namely, the endeavour to place the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities in the hands of the younger sons of reigning princes, was entirely due to the desire of these princes to increase their territories. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domains in the eastern provinces of Germany were few and insignificant, whereas in the north-west as well as throughout the west and south they were numerous, some being large in extent and of great importance. With exception of the territorially powerful <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> and the small diocese of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, those in the east and north came under the control of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes as "administrators" to the aggrandizement of the Houses of Wettin, Hohenzollern, and <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>. In this way these territories were made ripe for secularization. <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> princes became Bishops of Cologne and Hildesheim, which were, thereby, saved from the fate that befell the others. These measures quickened the process of consolidation by which the territories of a few dynastic houses in northern Germany steadily grew in extent, the result being of considerable importance in the future political development of Germany. On the other hand, the attempts of the princes to annex the spiritual principalities of southern Germany failed. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> entered these territories at a later date and with less force than it had in those of northern Germany. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lands in the south had more power of resistance than those in the north, while the princes were weaker, because their number was large and their possessions all small, excepting what belonged to the Austrian Hapsburgs on the Upper Rhine and perhaps also the territory belonging to <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. In these circumstances the Ecclesiastical Reservation (<em>Reservatum Ecclesiasticum</em>), adopted at the instance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the Recess of the Imperial Diet of 1555, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an effective precautionary measure in southern Germany. It provided that any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> who turned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> could not take advantage of the rule cujus regio, ejus religio, but must resign.

<p>The chief opponents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities in southern Germany were the representatives of the House of Wittelsbach, rulers of the Palatinates and of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Prominent because of their noble descent, the Elector Palatine being in fact the ranking temporal elector, they were all poor in land. The branch that ruled the Palatinate of Neuburg acquired a heritage on the Lower Rhine by marrying into the ducal House of Cleves-Juelich, which was becoming extinct. The other branches sought to extend their domains at the expense of their neighbours. What decided the predominance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the south was the result of two movements which settled the question whether the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, in spite of the successes in 1543-47 of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, were finally to seize Cologne and the whole country of the Lower Rhine and from these centres crush the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of southern Germany. In the first of these contests, the "Cologne War" (1582-84), which arose from the apostasy of Archbishop Gebhard Truchsess, the last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> who was not a <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were successful. In the second, the contest over the Cleves-Juelich succession on the extinction of the native ducal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the inheritance, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, passed to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rulers, the Palatines of Neuburg and the Hohenzollerns; but of these the Neuburg line became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1612, so that the danger was dispelled once more. As a consequence the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gained sufficient time, after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, to accomplish gradually the reconversion of the greater part of southern and western Germany, especially since <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in the south, and M&uuml;nster as well as Cologne in the west, remained faithful to it. The political consequence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> victory in the south-west was that this part of the empire, in contrast to the northern sections, continued to be split up into many principalities. This caused a constant state of unrest among the reigning princes and the nobles of the empire in south-western Germany. The electors palatine, especially, were dissatisfied with their fortunes. They pursued within the empire a policy of hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and to the imperial house that became more and more reckless with each succeeding decade. Moreover they were in league with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and other foreign countries. In accordance with this policy they turned from the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and put themselves at the head of all the discontented elements in the empire. Up to 1591 their aim was to bring about a union of all the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, including the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, for the purpose of enforcing the claims of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in south-western Germany. Even Saxony eventually took part in these negotiations. At the same time <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> also penetrated surreptitiously into central Germany (the so-called Crypto-Calvinisin). But in 1592 a complete revulsion took place in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. After that, the only remaining adherents of the palatine princes in central Germany were a few petty reigning princes and counts of that section. One of them, Christian of Anhalt, appears actually to have guided the policies of the electoral palatinate from 1592-1620. After sixteen years more of persistent urging, a few princes of south-western Germany joined the palatine princes in 1608 to form the "Protestant Union." Their value as allies, however, was in inverse ratio to their historical fame. The hopes of foreign succour that the palatine princes had entertained also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> vain; in 1609 the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> concluded an armistice with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; in 1610 Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was assassinated. In their disappointment the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> brought the entire machinery of the empire to a standstill by breaking up the Imperial Diet in 1613. In their freebooting temper the party was ready to snatch at whatsoever spoil presented itself.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> party was, nevertheless, too weak to inflict any serious harm. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, drew back more and more. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, led by <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, maintained a purely defensive attitude. The revival of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> among them made but slow progress, despite the strenuous exertions of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> rulers, of the Hapsburgs, and of individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/05271a.htm">Julius Echter of Mespelbrunn</a>, was the most prominent, and of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The situation was in no wise altered by the fact that in 1598 Maximilian I succeeded to the sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. He surpassed all the German princes of that period in ability and energy, and in the course of a few years he made <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> the most powerful of the German states. But he was prudent, peaceable, and above all intent on the internal improvement of his principality. Only on one occasion did he offer a decided opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> party; in 1607 he seized Donauw&ouml;rth, which had <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants. The Catholic League, which he organized in 1609 to offset the Protestant Union, was of a purely defensive nature.

<p>Thus, in spite of unrest, the peace of the empire was apparently not in immediate danger at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Its impotence, however, was most clearly manifested in its <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life. Under <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> the German mercantile <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> had made the mistake of giving itself largely to the profitable business of money transactions with governments. This was no longer lucrative, but the self-control <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the more arduous gains of industrial enterprises now hardly existed. Moreover, political conditions made commerce timid. The free cities of the empire, the centres of mercantile life, had lost the support of the imperial power. The princes were either hostile to them or still biased by their <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> views of land and agriculture. Furthermore, the extent of the several principalities was too small to form the basis of commercial undertakings while customs <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> closed their frontiers. Foreign competition was already proving a superior force; commerce and manufacture, with the prosperity of which the growth of great states seems universally bound up, were at the point of collapse in Germany. Intellectual life was in an equally discouraging state. Almost without knowing it the nation had been divided by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> into two religious camps, and a large part of it had accepted a wholly different <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The thoughts of the people were being concentrated more and more on this one fact. They were encouraged in this by the princes who had derived from the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> great advantages in position and possessions, and also by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on either side. The still insurmountable prejudice of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> of northern Germany against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> can be traced to the sermons of their preachers in the sixteenth century. From an entirely different point of view the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> exhorted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to have as little as possible to do with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Sectarian strife controlled all <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. Thereby the common consciousness of nationality was just as obscured in the people as it was dulled in the princes by political selfishness.
<h2 id="section3">From 1618 to 1713</h2>
<h3 id="A">1618 to 1648</h3>

<p>The political life of the German nation was quickened into fresh activity by the strong character of several princes who in their respective states took up almost simultaneously the fight against the preponderating power of the petty landed nobility. Those among these princes who made their mark on German history were Ferdinand II of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and, a generation later, Frederick William of Brandenburg, called the Great Elector. In 1617 <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> was chosen by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, on account of the vigour he had shown as ruler of <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, to be the associate and successor of Matthias. No sooner had the nobles felt Ferdinand's strong hand than they revolted in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, where they were most rebellious (1618). As Ferdinand did not have at his disposal the means to suppress it vigorously, the rebellion spread to the Danubian provinces, where it was supported by the rulers of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. When Matthias died (1619) the insurgents, through the mediation of Christian of Anhalt, went to the extreme of raising the head of the Union, Frederick V of Palatinate, to the throne of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (August, 1619), in order to obtain the help of the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. At the same time, however, Ferdinand was chosen emperor by the electors, whereupon Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the Elector of Saxony promised to fight on his side. The issue at stake was the existence of the Hapsburg dynasty. The struggle was carried on chiefly by troops of the two Wittelsbach lines and the Elector Palatine was defeated by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> on 8 November, 1620, at the battle of the White Mountain (Weissenberg) before the gates of Prague. Ferdinand II followed up his victory vigorously and from 1621 to 1628 established a new basis of political administration in his dominions. The multiplicity of heterogeneous Hapsburg territories, bound together almost solely by dynastic unity, was to be replaced by a compact Austrian state. This was to be founded on a system of government based on one official language, the German, on uniformity of administrative principles, on the profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the entire population, and on the steady support of the reigning house by a body of great landed proprietors whose states were made up of the confiscated lands of the landed petty nobility. These great landowners, established in the various dominions of the Hapsburgs and free from separatist traditions, were to represent the principle of a single state as against the peoples of the several provinces.

<p>The consequences of this change of system were soon felt all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The scheme had in view the organization of so extensive a state that the united Austrian dominion must needs become one of the great powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Hitherto great countries had developed only in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Their fields of conflict were <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Now, however, a strong power was rising on the borders of central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, which appeared to have unlimited room for expansion in the territories of eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. By means of its dynastic connexion with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> it was as well a menace to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As early as 1623 <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> supported each other in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; in 1628 Ferdinand by his power as emperor protected the interests of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the War of the Mantuan Succession. As a result <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> became the natural enemy of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> from the very beginning.

<p>It was for this reason that the empire first became interested in the issue of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The greater portion of its territory lay between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In the paralyzed condition of the empire a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between these two great countries would have to be fought out on imperial territory. It was remarkable that the clouds of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> so quickly gathered. For the states of western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were, first of all, hampered by internal troubles and by their relations to one another, while the Hapsburgs were occupied at home. Even Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, after the battle of the White Mountain, expected to bring the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to a speedy end by overcoming Christian of Anhalt and a few other adherents of the fugitive Elector Palatine. In order to bring the old Wittelsbach <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> feud to a final settlement, to seize the Upper Palatinate by way of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> indemnity, and to secure the transfer of the electoral dignity from the palatine to the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> line of the house Maximilian occupied the entire Palatinate. But <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> once kindled in the empire could not be confined within limits, and it spread slowly but steadily (see <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">THIRTY YEARS WAR</a>). Too much inflammable material had been accumulated by the discontent of the petty princes of the empire, by the religious animosities, by the lack of employment that resulted from the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> decline, and by the occupation of the border provinces by foreign powers. Whenever Maximilian gained a victory his enemies with very little trouble enlisted fresh hosts of mercenaries; the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> furnished the money. Very soon he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to send his army into north-western Germany; thus the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> continued to spread.

<p>Two events of the years 1624-29 increased animosities and, finally, in 1630, gave the struggle an international character.

<p>(a) The historical development of the German Hapsburgs had led to so close a connexion between their dynastic power in their own dominions and the imperial authority that the recovery of the former immediately filled Ferdinand with the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to restore the latter. When he drove the Elector Palatine out of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> he had also outlawed him as a prince of the empire. Now that the territories in the empire occupied by Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> were growing in extent and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was becoming more general throughout Germany, Ferdinand could hardly avoid assuming its direction. He had not the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> funds for such an undertaking, because of the persistently blundering <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> administration of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. But, he accepted Wallenstein's offer to maintain an army for him. Wallenstein was ambitious to be invested, as the head of an army, with extraordinary powers both military and diplomatic. He was a genius as an organizer and a remarkable man, but a <em>condottiere</em> rather than a statesman. Nevertheless the emperor placed him (1625) at the head of an army. Wallenstein did not act in conjunction with Maximilian's troops; moreover, he showed little respect either for the historically established relation between emperor and princes, or for the position of the latter in the empire. He quartered his troops in the territories of the princes, levied heavy contributions from their subjects and treated these sovereigns themselves with arrogance, while at the same time he was not a general who rapidly achieved decisive results. The blind jealousy that had animated the princes against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> was now directed against Ferdinand. Once more the complaint resounded that the emperor was placing on them "the yoke of brutal servitude," was making himself "monarch" of the empire, and an autocrat.

<p>(b) Maximilian followed up the victory of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and imperial forces by restoring <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the Upper Palatinate. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> demanded the restitution of the small territories in southern Germany of which they had been despoiled since 1550, despite the <em>Reservatum ecclesiasticum</em>. Furthermore, overestimating their success in the field, they sought to regain the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in northern Germany that had passed under Protestant administration. The emperor was impelled by his political interests to enforce the claims for restitution in the south, since this would greatly weaken the <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> dynasty, which was an obstacle to the extension of the Hapsburg power in Swabia. In addition he also authorized the reclamation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of northern Germany in the district of the Elbe and at the mouth of the Weser, in order to place them in the hands of an Austrian archduke. Accordingly he issued the Edict of Restitution of 1629. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> party of the Palatinate had been totally defeated, and now <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> was in danger of being confined to a comparatively narrow territory split up into detached districts by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities. On this account all the Protestant states of the empire were filled with distrust and resentment, although ill-prepared to take up arms in self-defence.

<p><a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a> had, meanwhile, overthrown the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and had laid plans to strengthen the French power in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the occupation of desirable positions in upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as well as in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and on German soil. He saw a menace to his schemes in the growth of the imperial power in the empire and in Ferdinand's interference in the War of the Mantuan Succession. He reminded the princes that Framoe had formerly protected their liberties, impressed them with its peace-loving character, and urged them, especially Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, to refuse to elect the emperor's son King of the Romans and to demand the dismissal of Wallenstein (1629-30). While he thus sought to deprive the emperor of his commander-in-chief and his main army, <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> also used every means to induce Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, to invade the empire. The appearance of Wallenstein on the Baltic coast and the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities on the Elbe by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> disturbed the ambitious King of Sweden. He was the ablest of all the princes who, in the first half of the seventeenth century, sustained the authority of the sovereign against the encroachments of the petty nobility in central and eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. After a speedily won success in Sweden itself, he set about the task of conquering all the territories on the Baltic in which the princes still suffered the inferior nobles to do as they pleased, thereby securing also for Sweden the control of this sea and a place as one of the great powers. If the Hapsburgs should accomplish their plans for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> the schemes of Gustavus Adolphus would be completely frustrated. For, in order to control all the lands on the Baltic and to sever permanently the German provinces of this region from the empire, he must unite them in an organic political system and civilization; this would be impossible unless all of them were separated in religion from the greater part of the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by professing <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. In the summer of 1630 the king landed in <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>; in August the emperor sacrificed Wallenstein to the princes.

<p>The success of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> intrigues and of the invasion of Gustavus Adolphus appeared more alarming at first than the outcome warranted. They did not cause the dynastic power of the Hapsburgs to totter. Gustavus Adolphus was killed at L&uuml;tzen (1632); his finest troops, the mainstay of his strength, were annihilated at N&ouml;rdlingen (1634). Thereafter the Swedes could achieve only ephemeral successes by means of a few bold but spasmodic excursions from the coast into the interior of the empire. Years passed before <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> was able to replace the army of Gustavus Adolphus by French troops. During the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> invasion he had occupied (1630-34) the whole of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and the region between the Moselle and the Upper Rhine. After the battle of N&ouml;rdlingen he openly declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the emperor (1635), but he did not venture far beyond the Rhine. Within the empire the first successes of the Swedes led to a reconciliation between Maximilian and the emperor, while the continued occupation of German soil by the Swedes and the French declaration of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> after <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> assurances of peace influenced most of the other princes to ally themselves again with the emperor, Saxony leading the way. There was a burst of patriotic indignation, such as had not been known for a long time; men were again ready to sacrifice their interests to those of the empire. In the Peace of Prague (1635) emperor and princes agreed upon the future organization of the empire. This treaty made allowances both for the historical development of the empire and its necessities: the enforcement of the Edict of Restitution was suspended, the autonomy of the Austrian dominions, of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and of the great states of northern Germany was recognized, and the exercise of the imperial authority, in so far as it extended to internal affairs, was confined to the smaller territories of the west and south. On the other hand, the administration by "circles" was to be revived and perfected. Against foreign foes all pledged themselves to act in common, no one desired any further separate leagues. In case of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> a consolidated imperial army was to enter the field. As early as 1635 the offensive was taken against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Swedes. In 1636 Ferdinand III was elected King of the Romans; he was emperor 1637-57.

<p>Thus the political unity of the German nation, sorely as it had suffered from the weakness of the imperial authority, the excessive growth of separatism, and the religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, stood the test in the hour of danger. However, its resources, seriously weakened after a struggle of twenty years, were not adequate to carry out the compact made at Prague and to relieve the distress of the empire at one stroke; <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, in particular, was not equal to its task. It was found impossible to drive the enemy by force out of the empire and to move all the estates to unite with the emperor. For the protection of the frontiers had been neglected and the individual states allowed to cultivate relations with foreign countries too long to permit the attainment of these ends. In western Germany the Landgravate of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> became a supporter of the French, while the young Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, who had succeeded to his electorate in the latter part of 1640, concluded an armistice with the Swedes. From 1640 on <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> was finally able to send French armies into Germany. The inadequacy of the services that <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> rendered the empire and the support it gave the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> throughout Germany, reawakened distrust in the emperor. Moreover <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions in the German states, after nearly a century of gradual decline, and the ravages since 1621 of the soldiery, became each year more pitiful. The need for rest excluded every other consideration. Even the antagonistic religious parties began to long for peace. The smaller estates of the empire felt no interest in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and demanded peace at any price with the foreign enemies; even the greater ones, becoming gradually exhausted, declared themselves neutral. In conjunction with the emperor, and even without him, they negotiated for peace at M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Sweden, whose influence thereby naturally became much more powerful. But the consciousness that they were parts of the empire did not again die out. A dim perception that <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in its development as a great power partly belonged largely to eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had deepened the conviction, which was encouraged by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, that the interests of the empire and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> were not absolutely identical, that the policy of the one need not of necessity be the policy of the other, and that the empire had needs of its own which should be safeguarded by the estates. In order to meet these exigencies the estates claimed, on behalf of the empire, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to seek the protection of other great powers as well as of the emperor, so as to find support in all emergencies either on one side or the other. Some declared that these needs were, above all, the restoration and maintenance of peace, and the preservation of the independence of the different estates of the empire, and of the varied forms of German governmental administration as opposed to the centralization of other countries. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, John Philip of Sch&ouml;nborn, the most active representative of the inferior estates, was strongly imbued with these principles.

<p>These views were officially recognized by the peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648). To procure the evacuation of Germany by the foreign armies <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was indemnified by that part of Alsace that belonged to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and Sweden by the territories at the mouths of the Oder and the Weser. The great possessions gained by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and in the countries on the Danube were not touched, but it agreed to cease supporting <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Within the empire everyone was restored to his own possessions and his own <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. At the same time, however, the possessions of the German princes having military resources were enlarged in such manner that the balance of power was maintained among them. To do this the lands of decadent principalities, especially the lands of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of northern Germany which were ready for secularization, were allotted to them. The consolidation of northern Germany into an ever decreasing number of states thus made another great advance, as was evidenced by the fact that towards the end of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> even the much divided possessions of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> in the north-west were combined to a large extent, like those of the other north German dynasties, under a single government. An attempt was made to assure the mutual recognition of the new territorial boundaries by establishing complete equality between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were satisfied with a slight enlargement of their possessions over those they held in the year 1618, the year taken as the standard being 1624, and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> Confession was recognized. The new order of things was protected, as regards the emperor, by proclaiming the sovereignty of the princes of the empire, by restoring to them the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make alliances, and by making <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Sweden the guarantors of the execution of the treaty. As against these two powers, however, it was most inadequately secured; the disturbances in the south-west, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were suppressed, but the division of that region into small states was maintained, and its development thereby impeded. The result was that the frontier bordering on <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was ill-protected, while the occupation of the lands at the mouths of the Oder and Weser by the Swedes was a perennial danger to northern Germany.
<h3 id="B">1648 to 1673</h3>

<p>Frightful as had been the devastation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and loss of life, the conclusion of peace did not find a ruined people. Both in political affairs and in the advance of civilization the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had brought about the renewal of national vigour. In most of the states the governments gave themselves to arduous work. Some commercial centres gradually revived, and by untiring energy the agriculture of northern Germany recovered its working power. Intellectual life also reawakened and grew apace. In <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>, and poetry, a succession of scholars, by a constantly increasing mastery of form and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, produced a series of great works. The study of these works during the next two decades matured the all-embracing genius of Leibniz (1646-1716). <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which reached the height of its literary culture in the following generation, was the teacher of Germany, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> derived especial advantage from the influence of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The reputation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> rapidly increased, and it soon exerted a powerful force of attraction over many high-minded <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in Germany which eventually led them into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Around Sch&ouml;nborn especially, who in 1647 had become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and chancellor of the empire, was gathered a circle of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, converts, and well-intentioned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, among the latter Leibniz. From Sch&ouml;nborn emanated an influence that permeated the entire <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of Germany. In the domain of politics <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hopes were founded on the military successes of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, which had shown themselves the strongest of the German states, on the efforts of Sch&ouml;nborn to infuse life into the administration by "circles," and on his attempt to form alliances among the princes with the ultimate aim of bringing about a general confederation of the estates. Sch&ouml;nborn desired, by means of such a general confederation, to make Germany under his own leadership independent of the favour of the great powers. Although this confederation was to be peaceful in character and could consequently only become a second grade power, he even hoped to make of it a means of establishing a balance of power in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, such as some <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> had sought to make of their country in the preceding century. Sch&ouml;nborn's policy was most successful in 1657-58, when Ferdinand III died without leaving an heir who had attained his majority and had been elected King of the Romans, thus giving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> an opportunity to attempt to dictate the succession to the imperial crown. Sch&ouml;nborn, however, secured its bestowal upon another Hapsburg, Leopold I (1658-1705); at the same time he united a large number of princes in the Confederation of the Rhine (<em>Rheinbund</em>), which looked for support to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Still more powerful but not more advantageous for Germany was the influence exercised on the course of events by another reigning prince, Frederick William of Brandenburg, the Great Elector. His contemporaries looked upon him only as the most turbulent of the rulers in the empire. His chief object was the aggrandizement of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a> to the eastward of the Elbe, but in the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> he had been compensated by new territories in western Germany. Dissatisfied with this arrangement he openly avowed that as the greater part of his dominion bordered on eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, he, like <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and even more unscrupulously, did not consider the interests of Germany as identical with those of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>. When Sweden declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1655 he took part on the side of the former country with all his resources. In 1658 the new emperor joined forces with him to drive Sweden out of Germany. In order to be more certain of the aid of the imperial troops Frederick William, at the election of the emperor, brought it about that <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was required to renew its pledges not to support <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was preparing to strike the final blow. This threatened Germany once more with serious danger, for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, after forcing <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> into concluding the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659, in 1660 dictated peace on the Baltic at <a href="../cathen/11242b.htm">Oliva</a> and Copenhagen on such terms that <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> was protected against any diminution of its territories. Then when the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, after a long truce, renewed their advance on <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1662 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> forced auxiliaries on <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> as soon as the latter began to offer a sturdy defence. Consequently, after the first victories, Leopold preferred to come to a secret understanding with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> at Vasv&aacute;r (1664). <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> interfered in every quarrel among the states of the empire.

<p>Aided by the personal charm of its young king <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, who had assumed the government in 1661, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> appeared to have obtained a dominant influence in Germany such as <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> had formerly held in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. What it had vainly striven to gain by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> now acquired during ten years of peace. Apparently in all parts of the empire, including <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, there was a continually growing need of peace. The subsidies that Louis poured into the exchequers of the impecunious princes, who were just beginning to devise a rational system of taxation, were intended to fetter them. The upper classes in Germany surrendered themselves completely to the influence of French culture and customs. Moreover, French statecraft, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> policy, and military system, which presented to the princes an example of effective administrative organisation, all promised to place Germany more and more under the spell of its western neighbour. The Houses of <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> and Wittelsbach and the rulers of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> allowed themselves to be won over by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1667-68 Louis was able to place a check upon the Elector of Brandenburg, and also upon <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the dynastic line of which was now reduced to one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and threatened to become extinct like that of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Although the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> led the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> to take <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as a model, yet in many unseen ways it prepared the emancipation of Germany. The national consciousness became quickened in proportion as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life reawakened, and the national spirit once more found a voice. The princes gradually drew back from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and its friendship was only seriously sought by the House of Wittelsbach. When de Lionne, Louis's adviser in foreign affairs, warned him not to carry out his purpose of attacking the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> until he was sure of the sympathy of the more important German princes, all the efforts of the able French diplomats did not avail to obtain this assurance. Louis, nevertheless, advanced against the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and a storm of popular indignation broke out in Germany which carried along with it the German princes, with the exception of the Wittelsbach line. In 1674 the empire declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
<h3 id="C">1674-1713</h3>

<p>This was the signal for a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of forty years duration, which was divided into three periods. In the first the advantages of efficient generals, well-trained troops, and abundant means were all on the side of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The contingents of the German princes formed a motley body; in 1675 the Elector of Brandenburg withdrew, and marched into <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> against the Swedes. In addition, the allies of the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> inefficient. Only a few isolated exploits, such as the battle of Fehrbellin (1675), revived the fame of German military prowess. In 1679 peace was made between the empire and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at Nimwegen. Louis, however, overestimated his success. On the one hand he calculated on detaching the Elector of Brandenburg permanently from the German cause by compelling him in 1660, to restore all the territory won from the Swedes and then to enter into an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that would reduce him almost to feudatory dependence. On the other hand, after peace had been signed, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> seized various strips of territory on the western frontier of Germany (called the "Reunions"), this unwarranted procedure culminating in the occupation of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (1781). Such conduct, however, only stimulated the patriotic indignation of the small western states (Alliance of Laxenburg, 1682), while at the same time the rising generation in the larger principalities, including the territories of the Wittelsbach line, was rallying enthusiastically around the emperor for the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The repulse of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> at the siege of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1683), followed by the glorious recovery of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, gave a new, impulse to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> political power. With the increase of French interference in German affairs (succession to the Palatinate, 1685; election of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 1688), German resistance to Louis, in which Brandenburg joined, became unanimous. Louis retorted by renewing <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Although <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was still engaged in the struggle with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the military forces of the two sides were almost even. The Margrave Louis William of Baden organized the troops of the small south-western states of Germany in an efficient manner. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> found in Eugene of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> a general and statesman who, in a position similar to Wallenstein's, far surpassed the latter in genius and character. Moreover, the emperor found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> a far more efficient ally than the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> had been. Both sides brought larger and larger armies into the field, until each of them maintained 400,000 men. By the Peace of Ryswick (1697) Louis restored part of the territory of which he had robbed the empire. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, by the brilliant victory of Zenta (1697), drove the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> completely out of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> (Treaty of Carlowitz, 1699). The death of the last Spanish Hapsburg (1700) caused a fresh outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> as early as 1701. This time <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was able to employ most of its forces against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> being again the ally of the empire. The allied powers won brilliant victories, some jointly, some separately (Blenheim, 1704, Ramillies and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 1706, Oudenarde, 1708, Malplaquet, 1709). By straining its powers to the utmost <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> bettered its position after 1709. During the course of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> changed rulers twice, Joseph I reigning 1705-11, Charles VI, 1711-40. After Charles VI ascended the throne <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> deserted <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. By the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden in 1713-14 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> retained only Alsace out of all its conquests on the German frontier. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which had once more become embroiled with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, again defeated the latter, and imposed terms at the Peace of Passarowitz in 1718 that were extremely favourable to Austrian trade in the Levant. At the same time a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was raging between <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Sweden, and the princes of northern Germany took advantage of it to drive Sweden completely out of Germany (treaty of <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> between Sweden and <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> in 1719; between Sweden and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1720).

<p>By the victories over the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and by its opposition to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> the Austrian monarchy became in the fullest sense a great power, while <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> effected no substantial extension of its frontiers. In this way the plans of Ferdinand II were realized and secured for a long period. But at the same time Ferdinand's successors allowed the imperial power and the reorganization of the empire to decline. In the reign of Leopold I the Diet had, indeed, become a permanent body at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> from 1663, and the empire took part as a whole in all three periods of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The contemporary sovereign princes, however, were interested chiefly in the political development of the separate states. Their policies were based on the centralizing and absolutist principles of the government of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. These principles were susceptible of application to the individual principalities, but not to the empire, which, by its very nature, was federal and parliamentary. The empire could never have the same bureaucratic form of administration that the separate principalities had now received, nor could it be organized on a fiscal basis similar to theirs. Consequently <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which had become a kingdom in 1701, and the other larger German states detached themselves more and more from the empire. Some ruling houses, dissatisfied with the smallness of their territories, which did not admit of extension, were disposed, at the beginning of the new century, to seek new countries. The Elector of Saxony, belonging to the Wettin line, accepted the crown of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1697), while the main branch of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> ascended the throne of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1714). The branch of the House of Wittelsbach that ruled <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> aspired to the crown of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, or at least to the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. When foiled in this they made an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1701; this doomed them to an unfruitful, separatist policy in their territories. Even among the people the conception of imperial unity no longer obtained. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the nation made steady progress towards <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> unity, as the development of its written language improved. Moreover between 1660 and 1690 the patriotic sentiment of the nation showed itself plainly, but it grew weak again at the very moment that was decisive for a constitutional policy. For the people took but little interest in the aims of the last period of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the struggle over the Spanish succession while at the same time the entire organic life of a nation was undergoing a vital crisis. Economically the country made but little progress because its resources were too much exhausted and the constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> permitted no recuperation. Consequently the social organization of the nation, in particular, lost its elasticity; the nobility became arrogant, the middle class decayed, the bureaucracy grew overweening and excluded all others from participation in state affairs. During this period the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> made no effort to secure national unity. Under these circumstances, notwithstanding the German victories, foreign countries affected in large measure German politics. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> continued to be the guaranteeing power. Two other great powers, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, had considerable influence, the former on <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, with which it was connected by a common dynasty, the other on all the German states on the Baltic, especially <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> lost its preponderance once more owing both to the renewed decay of political and national life in Germany and to the decline of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At the beginning of the eighteenth century its progress lay in the field of art, especially in that of architecture. In <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and the capitals of the spiritual and temporal lords of southern Germany many architecturally striking buildings were erected; among the great architects and fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of the period were Hildebrand, Pr&auml;ndauer, Fischer of Erlach, Neumann, and the brothers Asam. Protestantism, however, led in learning, as was exemplified by the professors of the University of Halle, Thomasius, Christian Wolff, Francke. Moreover, the close relations of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to Germany now began to make themselves felt, and German Protestantism found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> a powerful and progressive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> aid that <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> had not been able to afford.
<h2 id="section4">From 1713 to 1848</h2>
<h3 id="A">1713 to 1763</h3>

<p>Many petty differences were still left unsettled in 1713, many an <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was as yet unrealized. In Germany as well as in the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> questions remained to be settled by diplomatic negotiations, but swords were sheathed. The people had an intense desire for peace. The industrial classes longed to emerge from the miserable hand-to-mouth existence which had been theirs for so many years, to rise again to the profitable exercise of trades and commerce, and to accumulate capital for larger undertakings. For several decades to come they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to work without visible results. But the strenuous effort produced the will and the strength <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to achieve the phenomenal <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> progress of the German people in the nineteenth century. The prevailing tendency among the princes and nobility was towards the voluptuous enjoyment of the social and artistic pleasures of life, which they gratified by the erection of magnificent buildings and by gorgeous court ceremonials; examples of the indulgence of such tastes were the rulers of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> Augustus II (1694-1733) and Augustus III (1733-63), the latter being also King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; Maximilian II Emanuel of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1679-1726); Eberhard Louis (1677-1733) and Charles Eugene (1737-93) of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. Men of higher aims were Maximilian III Joseph of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1745-77), and, among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially those of the Sch&ouml;nborn <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. In the interior development of the states the princes sought to complete the reorganization of their territories according to the French absolutist and bureaucratic model, as: the introduction of state officials into local government, the collection of taxes in coin and a money basis for trade, the augmentation of the standing armies, repression of the privileges of the nobility, and the extinction of parliamentary and corporative <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. To perfect such a system both persistent and steady effort was needed; the majority of states fell short in this respect. In <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> the nobles gradually recovered control of the government; in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> a perilous state of political inertia set in under Charles I. Frederick William I of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1713-40) was the only sovereign who carried out the work of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> reconstruction with energy. The ideal state which the statesmen of the age of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> sought to attain, an ideal impracticable in larger countries, was to a great extent realized in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Small as was <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> territory and backward as it was in civilization, it grew, nevertheless, into a power influential out of all proportion to the size of its population and area, thanks to the high efficiency of the administration, to the utilization of all resources for the benefit of the state, and to the unflagging energy of the king himself. Shortly after 1740 <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was able to maintain a standing army of more than 100,000 men ready for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and with this army it could turn the scale in a conflict between the equally balanced forces of the great countries.

<p>In 1740 <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, the Great, succeeded to the throne of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In the period just passed <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had exhausted themselves in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> begun in 1733 over issues that had not been settled in 1713, namely, the Polish Succession, and the right of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to Lorraine. By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1738 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> obtained Lorraine; <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, moreover in 1739 lost Belgrad to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Soon after Frederick's accession in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the Emperor Charles VI died, leaving a daughter, <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> (1740-80). <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> took up arms to prevent her coming to the throne of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; this was in direct violation of the promises made to Charles when these countries recognized the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>. At the instigation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the electors chose Charles Albert of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> emperor under the title of Charles VII (1742-45). Frederick the Great took full advantage of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa's</a> difficulties; he occupied Silesia and, upon her refusal to surrender it, concluded an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that followed upon this were the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48), the First Silesian War (1740-42), and the Second Silesian War (1744-45). Impaired in strength during the weak government of Charles VI, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> seemed ready to fall to pieces under the force of the shock. But the hesitation of Frederick the Great, the aid of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> ally after 1742, and above all <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa's</a> political energy and inspiriting <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> helped <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to withstand the shock. Silesia, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, was not recovered, but <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> kept all the other provinces and in 1745 her husband, <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, was elected emperor. She found in <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a> a most valuable guide in matters of foreign policy and a wise assistant in the direction of home affairs. The internal administration was steadily perfected in imitation of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the army was reorganized by Daun, Laudon, and Lacy. Further, by the new alliance between the three great <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> powers, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was once more established in a commanding position in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. However, Frederick, with the aid of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as ally, prevented the consequences of these measures from becoming immediately apparent. In 1756 he made a fresh attack on <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> while <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> simultaneously went to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the purpose of acquiring the latter's colonies. The ensuing struggle was the Seven Years War, which exposed the weak points of the schemes of <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a> and especially the decline in the military strength of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> before their excellences could be turned to use. Moreover <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, by summoning as empress the French to enter the country, stifled in the princes all feeling of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to the empire, while Frederick by his victory over the French at Rossbach (1757) became a national hero despite the unpopularity of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In addition, the sturdy resistance that the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> king offered to the three powers, even though he failed of victory, made an impression on the political world in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> favour no less great in results than were the consequences in northern Germany of his alliance with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
<h3 id="B">1761 to 1815</h3>

<p>After the Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763) <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was not only an independent state, it had as well an independent policy. From this time on the rest of northern Germany also became alienated from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and southern Germany. These states now received an impulse from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> such as they had never had from the empire and Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in this period was rapidly advancing in commerce, industries, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life, and exhibited an energetic and far-seeing political policy. The mining of the coal and ore deposits in the Rhenish-Westphalian district and in Silesia was undertaken on a large scale, the number of factories increased, the Hanseatic towns took advantage of the American Declaration of Independence to establish transoceanic trade relations that were pregnant with rich results for the future of German commerce, while agriculture east of the Elbe adopted larger methods involving the use of capital in order to develop export trade in grain with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In addition to Halle other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in northern Germany became noted as centres of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life; among these were G&ouml;ttingen, founded in 1737, which had the historians and writers on political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, Schl&ouml;zer and Spittler, as professors, and K&ouml;nigsberg, where <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> and Kraus taught. Most of the precursors of the classical age of German poetry, as Klopstock and Lessing, were North Germans, so were many of the writers of the Storm and Stress (<em>Sturm und Drang</em>) period. And although Goethe and Schiller, the great poets of the classic era, were South Germans, yet they made their homes in the north, the centre from which their influence was exerted being the Court of Weimar. <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a> and the two Humboldts were <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>. The Romantic School also under the leadership of North Germans, the Schlegels, Hardenberg, Tieck, Schleiermacher, developed around two northern cities, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and Jena. It was through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> ascendancy exerted by northern Germany that <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> were brought almost completely within the sphere of German culture. From north-western Germany proceeded the chief influences that in a periodical press created German public opinion (Schl&ouml;zer's criticisms on contemporary politics in his "Staatsanzeigen," the political writings of Gentz), and encouraged the sense of nationality (M&ouml;ser, <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Count Stolberg</a>). It was in this part of Germany that Freiherr vom Stein received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and his training in official life. The relatively large area of the states of northern Germany, the result of the last two hundred and fifty years of political evolution, encouraged <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress and was in turn promoted thereby. For the first time northern Germany undertook to outstrip southern Germany in development; along with this, however, the Protestant states once more took the lead of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that southern Germany immediately strove to compete with northern Germany, but the division of the former section into so many small principalities paralyzed commerce and retarded <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress and the development of industries. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, joint-ruler with <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> from 1760 and sole ruler of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> from 1780 to 1790, desired to remedy this disintegration by annexing <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and by extending the Austrian power in Swabia and on the Upper Rhine. The latter result he desired to attain by making the city of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> a great emporium of trade between <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Germany. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> he set on foot far-reaching projects of reform. On the non-material side he and other rulers strove to infuse new strength into the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and civilizing influence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> as opposed to Protestantism. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in southern Germany, which remained closely in touch with French <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life, suffered from the paralyzing influence of French <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> and its destructive critical tendencies. The champions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, foremost among them being the Prince-Abbot Martin Gerbert of St. Blasien, gave it a more national basis again and infused into it a more positive spirit. But they failed, almost without exception, to renounce in principle the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> movement; this failure led many men, as <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a>, into grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Progress in southern Germany depended ultimately upon progress in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Not only, however, did all the political plans for Germany of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> break down before the opposition of Frederick the Great, as shown in the War of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Succession (1778-79) and in the league of princes formed by Frederick against Joseph (1785), but towards the end of Joseph's reign serious revolutionary movements sprang up against him even in his own dominions. A complete reversal of the relative strength of northern and southern Germany seemed imminent. Nevertheless northern Germany did not fully utilize the pre-eminence it had obtained in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress. In spirit Frederick the Great was not in sympathy with recent developments. The English political system rested on principles differing widely from French absolutism, the methods and aims of which Frederick, following in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> footsteps, clung to tenaciously. He even carried these somewhat further, especially in regard to <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> administration. Taken altogether his political achievements were the greatest and most effective development of the French system. After 1763 by the annexation of West <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, obtained through the First Partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1722, he extended his dominions in the district of the Oder and Weichsel Rivers, and by adopting the policy of Catherine II of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> he secured for his kingdom a strong position among the states of Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Moreover he declared his intention to give special weight to the eastern or <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> part of his monarchy by making its nobility, the <em>Junker</em>, his principal instruments both in the military and civil administration. From the time of their arrival in these districts these nobles had been trained to fight and to colonize. The impulse towards a united northern Germany could in this era only come from Frederick the Great, the middle class of north-western Germany had not as yet made itself felt. In 1786 Frederick died, whereupon <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> prestige declined once more. Bereft of a strong political stimulus the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of Germany, both north and south, took on a cosmopolitan and purely humanitarian character.

<p>Even the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> at first produced in Germany not progress but a shock. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of 1789 were greeted with approval, but when the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> became radical in 1792 and involved Germany in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the people, craving peaceful development, without exception rejected it. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, reorganized by Leopold II (1790-92), took up again under <a href="../cathen/14710b.htm">Thugut</a>, prime-minister of Francis II, who was Francis I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1792-1835), the policy of expansion initiated by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. <a href="../cathen/14710b.htm">Thugut</a>, however, preferred to make conquests in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> rather than in southern Germany, and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> victories in 1796 compelled him to desist even from these (Treaty of Campo-Formio, 1797). The princes of southern Germany, being left to themselves, now turned to the French government and by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> supplication obtained from it the aggrandizement of their territories at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers whose dominions were to be secularized. At the Congress of Rastatt (1797-99) <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was willing to grant their petitions, but <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> brought the congress to a premature end by renewing the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Previous to this, in 1792, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had joined <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in taking up arms against the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. At he Treaty of Basle (1795), however, it had deserted <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and, influenced by French diplomacy, disclosed for the first time its <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to become the ruling power of northern Germany, to annex <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> and to carry out the secularization of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lands. But Frederick the Great's successors, Frederick William II (1786-97) and Frederick William III (1797-1840), were men of little energy. Moreover at the Second (1793) and Third (1795) Partitions of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had assumed more Polish territory than it could assimilate; its administrative resources, unable to bear the strain put upon them, were paralyzed. Thus the end of the eighteenth century left Germany in complete disorder.

<p>South-western Germany, brought into constant contact with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by active commercial relations, now manifested a desire for comprehensive and efficient political organization. For, by the impetuosity with which the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> preached the principle of nationality and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the individual in the State, the German mind had again become accessible to national <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and strong political convictions. From the beginning of the nineteenth century the Romantic School extolled the glories of German nationality and the empire, and the younger generation of officials in the several states, especially in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, promoted drastic measures of reform. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, as the instrument of the times, contributed to the realization of these ideals. Defeating <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> again, both in 1800 (Treaty of Luneville, 1801), and in 1805 (Treaty of Presburg), <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> proceeded to make a new distribution of German territory. By the Treaty of Luneville he annexed the left bank of the Rhine to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. By the partition compacts with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1802 and by the Imperial Delegates Enactment of 1803, he secularized such <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> states as still existed, and in 1805-06 he abolished the rest of the decadent petty principalities in the south, including the domains of the free <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the empire and of the free cities. He was to retain only three territorial divisions in southern Germany: <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, and Baden. These his creative genius built up into secondary states, similar to those of northern Germany both in area and in their capacity for internal development. The South Germans had at last a clear course for renewed progress. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> hoped thereby to put them under lasting <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; in 1806 he bound them, as well as the central German states, more strongly to himself by the Confederation of the Rhine (<em>Rheinbund</em>). In the abolition of the small principalities he gave the death-blow to the Holy Roman Empire, which ceased to exist, 6 August, 1806. The administration and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> condition of the secondary states now rapidly improved, but, contrary to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> expectations, the sympathies of their inhabitants did not turn to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> then overthrew <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> at the battles of Jena and Auerst&auml;dt (1806) and by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) left to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> only its original provinces between the Elbe and the Russian frontier. After this, by means of far-reaching, liberal reforms instituted under the enlightened guidance of Freiherr vom Stein aided by Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, both state and army in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> became stronger and more progressive than ever before. In all the German lands on the right bank of the Rhine the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes were full of fervid patriotism, and in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> as well the people bore the foreign yoke with impatience. In 1809 a national <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> broke out in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The Tyrolese under Hofer made a heroic struggle, and Archduke Charles won a victory over the French at Aspern. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, notwithstanding all this, finally maintained his ascendancy (Treaty of Schoenbrunn, also called of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1809), and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, thereafter, by the advice of <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a>, who was prime-minister from 1809 to 1848, adopted a policy of inaction. Pursuing an opposite course, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> people rose in a body in 1813 after <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> disastrous campaign in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. This revolt <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> did not succeed in crushing; on the contrary, he himself was now defeated in the Wars of Liberation by the coalition of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>The interior of Germany, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> home of Teutonic national life, had been forced almost completely into the background during the eighteenth century by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. During the Napoleonic era it advanced materially in influence as a result of the formation of the secondary states and the growth of national political opinions. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> re-established their military ascendancy over the interior during the Wars of Liberation. In the Treaties of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1814) and at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1814-15) efforts were made to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to both of these circumstances. Under <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich's</a> guidance <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> reached the climax of its power at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. It became the leading state in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but at the same time it made the Danube and the territory east of the Alps the centres of its power and withdrew completely from southern Germany. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, now likewise recognized as a great power and a leading state of Germany, received, on condition of surrendering a part of its Polish possessions, a strong position in the extreme north-west, but it did not attain the hegemony of northern Germany. The Napoleonic system of secondary states was ratified and amplified, as in the four kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and Saxony, etc. It was hoped that this settlement would be permanent since it was founded on the joint liability of all the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states, a principle recognized by the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> Congress and the maintenance of which was guaranteed both by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Moreover the political rivalry between the different faiths was supposed to have been overcome, since of the great powers <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> Protestant, and both were now on friendly terms. By the award of many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts to Protestant sovereigns <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> had, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, sustained great losses in central Germany, <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> being one-third, Baden two-thirds and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> almost one-half <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. It was thought, however, that none of these states, not even <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, could be able thereafter to retain an entirely Protestant character. Moreover <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> gained greater influence over the minds of men owing to the Romantic movement and the spread of anti-revolutionary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a>, continuing the policy decided upon in 1548 and 1635, committed himself to the following programme: to give a new guarantee to the reawakened national feeling by establishing a German Confederation; that each German state must belong to the Confederation, though without prejudice to its autonomy; that the primary object of the Confederation was to be the defence of the independence and stability of Germany against external foes as well as against revolutionary agitation; but it was also to be allowed to develop into a confederated state by gradually enlarging its authority over the internal affairs of the individual states, such as commerce, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> administration civil and constitutional law. The organ of this confederation was to be a permanent assembly composed of plenipotentiaries appointed by the reigning princes, as in the Imperial Diet prior to 1806. This body was authorized to enact fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the Confederation and to organize its administrative machinery (Federal Acts of the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 9 June, 1815).
<h3 id="C">1815 to 1848</h3>

<p>The Federal Diet was in session from 1816 to 1848 and again from 1850 to 1866 without, however, enacting any fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or creating any administrative machinery. The only result of the deliberations was a fuller and more detailed but not a more definite statement of the problems to be solved by the confederation (Final Federal Act of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1820), and this in spite of <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich's</a> pressure for the working out of these problems. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the secondary states opposed all progress in the work of the Diet. Even <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> was no longer really in earnest about it. In the autumn of 1815 he had concluded the Holy Alliance with the Czar and the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and had thereby bound himself to a common policy with the great powers of Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the three countries <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> being then called the eastern powers. This policy, in view of the possibility of revolutionary agitation, opposed the national and constitutional current of the times. Moreover, as Premier of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich's</a> course had to be directed by the fact that, after the troubles of the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> and the losses sustained in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> during the last twenty-five years, the country stood in need of absolute rest. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> kept its people from all foreign commercial competition and in politics avoided contact with foreign nations. Consequently its policy within the confederation was restricted substantially to the safeguarding of its own interests.

<p>Between 1815 and 1848 <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the secondary states also devoted themselves exclusively to the solution of problems within their own boundaries. Up to 1848 Germany witnessed the most complete autonomy of the individual states in its entire history. The need of national unity was once more entirely ignored. In most of the secondary states much was done to improve the administration and the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> policy. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the self-reliance of which had been still further intensified by the Wars of Independence waged against <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, completed the reforms that had been started in the period before 1815, although not in the German national spirit of their authors but rather in accordance with antiquated <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Even the new western provinces were as far as possible subjected to the old <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> law as well as the old <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy and methods of government. At the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, founded in 1909 by William von Humboldt, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> raised the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> conception of the state, filled with the spirit of Protestantism and rooted in absolutism, to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system. He gave this position to the state as the highest and all-controlling form of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Nevertheless the individual German states had clearly passed the limit of their capacity for organization. Routine dominated state administration. A well-trained but arrogant bureaucracy seized control of the government in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> as well in the secondary states and while it carried to excess the traditional political principles, yet it did not enforce them with the firm hand of the rulers of an earlier era. This was especially the case in the conflict concerning <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> in the fourth decade of the century when the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government arrested <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Archbishop Droste-Vischering</a> of Cologne as an "insubordinate servant of the state" (1837). Its weakness was also plainly shown when the people of western and southern Germany objected to the interfering supervision of the government officials.

<p>The middle class was indebted to <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> for more than thirty years of uninterrupted peace, during which he protected it from all disturbances both at home and abroad, and they owed to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> more favourable to commerce than had ever before existed. These were the moderately protective <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> customs law of 1818 and the founding (1833) of the customs-union (<em>Zollverein</em>), which made a commercial unit of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, central and southern Germany. Now for the first time the exertions of the commercial classes during the eighteenth century brought forth ample fruit, and Germany regained the financial ability to undertake large commercial enterprises. Important industries flourished and traffic was increased many-fold, while the middle class gained a clearer perception of the influence of foreign and domestic policies on <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions. The leaders (Hansemann, Mevissen, and von der Heydt) in the manufacturing district of the Lower Rhine, the most promising region in Germany from an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> point of view, were ready as early as 1840 to guide the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, provided they could obtain political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Holding radical views in politics and religion, they adopted also the political demands of their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> kinsmen in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>: the creation of a constitutional parliament and the remodelling of the body politic in accordance with their social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> principles. As <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> like <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> had not granted its subjects a constitution, the struggle of these men for influence was conducted under difficulties. Their efforts, however, were aided by the existence of constitutional government in some of the smaller states since 1819, whereby a number of men, mostly <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors, were enabled in the several Diets to attack the bureaucratic administrations. These men were also <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, but their primary demand was the substitution of popular government for that of the bureaucracy; the leaders were Rotteck and Welcker of Baden; and of the moderates, Dahlmann. As early as 1837 matters came to a crisis in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, while in Baden the contest lasted from 1837 to 1844. In answer to the opposition they called forth the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> raised the battle-cry of national unity, claiming that union would be the strongest guarantee of civic liberty. Their programme, as well as the appeal to the moral feeling of the people made by many of their leaders, aroused universal sympathy. As champions both of the principle of national unity and of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and social progress, they hoped soon to be able to lead the entire people in a struggle against the reactionary administrations of the individual states. The latter, blinded by their particularistic prejudices, did not rally their forces to meet the threatening attack. As early as the forties differences on politico-economic questions weakened the customs-union between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the states of southern Germany. <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> had repeatedly urged that <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> become a member of the customs-union. But it now appeared that the social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> differences, always existing between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the rest of Germany, had been so accentuated by the selfish policy pursued by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> since 1815 that a strong opposition to its entering the customs-union came from within <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> itself.

<p>The position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also became critical. The expectations of the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> had not been realized. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, owing to the splendid abilities of a number of men, partly the sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and partly converts, exercised a leading influence in the field of political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> (<a href="../cathen/07119a.htm">Haller</a>, Adam M&uuml;ller, Frederick von Schlegel, G&ouml;rres, <a href="../cathen/08323a.htm">Jarcke</a>, <a href="../cathen/12631c.htm">Radowitz</a>), in history (Buchholtz, <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>), in art (Cornelius, <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>, <a href="../cathen/15322a.htm">Veit</a>), and in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> (M&ouml;hler, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a>, Hefele). But in actual political life and in connexion with the life of the masses it fared ill. The bureaucratic state administration so fettered the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that it was hardly able to stir, while <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, for the most part anti-Catholic, threatened to place a gulf between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the people. The deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the people, however, was manifested both in 1844, on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and in the rejection of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> (1844-46). The attempt, however, to build up a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and anti-revolutionary party in conjunction with a few conservative <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (the two von Gerlachs, and the periodical "Politisches Wochenblatt" in Berlin; G&ouml;rres and his circle of friends in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>), on the basis of <a href="../cathen/07119a.htm">Haller's</a> political teaching, was unpopular and altogether out of sympathy with the actual politico-social and politico-economic development of the nation. Nevertheless a few <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> politicians attacked at the same time the bureaucratic administration and <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>; thus G&ouml;rres published his "Athanasius" in 1837, and founded with friends the periodical "Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter" in 1838; others were <a href="../cathen/01468a.htm">Andlaw</a> and <a href="../cathen/03088a.htm">Buss</a> in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a> and Hefele in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09235a.htm">Moritz Lieber</a> in Nassau. In <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were represented by the Abel ministry (1837-47). In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> favoured them.
<h2 id="section5">From 1848 to 1871</h2>

<p>The wide-spread political agitation in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, which from 1846 had been undermining the foundations of the system of government established by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, culminated in Germany in March, 1848. The reigning princes, unprepared for the emergency, turned the governments over to the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and ordered elections for a German Parliament on the basis of universal suffrage. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, in addition, now granted constitutions to their peoples and, besides the national, summoned local parliaments. On 18 May the German National Parliament was opened at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a>, Heinrich von Gagern presiding. Archduke Johann of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was elected provisional imperial administrator. The success of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> was apparently complete, the individual existence of the separate states practically annulled, and the establishment of a constitutional German national State, as opposed to the development as a confederation, seemed assured. The only difficult question was, apparently, how <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was to be "merged" into Germany. However, as Frederick William IV of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1840-61) had expressed his sympathy with German unity, while the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> were prepared to make it as easy as possible for <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, as the head of the customs-union and the leading Protestant power in Germany, to surrender its individuality as a state, and were ready to offer to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> the hereditary imperial crown, the Parliament made light of this obstacle. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, rent by grievous national dissensions, seemed ready to step aside of its own accord.

<p>In the autumn of 1848, however, the situation became complicated. The draft of a new constitution made by the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> awakened the distrust of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by its provisions regarding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. At the suggestion of the Pius Association (<a href="../cathen/12139a.htm"><em>Piusverein</em></a>) of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> flooded the Parliament with petitions, while in October the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> assembled at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> gave way but conditions remained strained. The great mass of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> repudiated the proposed settlement of the German question in the "Little German" (<em>Kleindeutsche</em>) sense, which advocated the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> from German and the conferring of the imperial dignity upon <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; they demanded that <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> should remain part of Germany and should be its leader. This was called the "Great German" (<em>Grossdeutsche</em>) view. Simultaneously a radical reaction broke out against the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>. <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> stood for <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and political progress only, not for social progress; nevertheless it had received the support of the labouring classes, who were impoverished by the recent industrial development but not ready to become a political organization, because of the Liberal opposition to the existing state of things. Now that the Parliament did nothing to better their condition they flocked to the standards of radical agitators. Before the spring of 1849 repeated disturbances resulted, especially in Southern Germany; furthermore Radicalism obtained a majority in the constitutional assembly of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> were not able to make any headway against this movement. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops had to re-establish the authority of the state, and in the interim the reigning princes had also regained confidence. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, now under the leadership of Schwarzenberg (Francis Joseph having been emperor since November, 1848), declared in December, 1848, that it would not suffer itself to be forced out of Germany. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> agitation as well as the politico-economic movements were in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> favour. The industrial classes of Southern Germany, inspired by the fear that <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> would adopt free-trade, desired to secure a politico-economic alliance with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, while the great merchants of the Hanseatic cities preferred for the field of their commercial operations Germany with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> included, an area extending from the Baltic Sea to the Levant, to the lesser Germany alone. Having imposed a constitution on his kingdom in December, 1848, the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> refused to accept the imperial crown at the hands of the Frankfurt Parliament (April, 1849). Maximilian II of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1848-64), by a strange recourse to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the seventeenth century, advocated a union of the secondary states, which in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> but not in subjection to it, should control the policy of Germany (the "Triad").

<p>In May, 1848, the Frankfort Parliament came to an inglorious end. An attempt was made immediately afterwards by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> with the aid of the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and the secondary states to agree on a German constitution maintaining the federal principle (The Union, Diet of Erfurt, 1850), and to form merely an offensive and defensive alliance with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; this was foiled by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. But although <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> forced <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> to yield in the negotiations at <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> in December, 1850, it failed to effect either the renewal of the German Confederation under conditions that would strengthen itself or to gain admission to the customs-union. The German Diet, still unreformed, resumed its deliberations in 1851, while by the treaty of February, 1853 (<em>Februarvertrag</em>) the negotiations for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> entrance into the customs-union were postponed for six years. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> neutralized each other's influence and nothing was done, either in the customs-union or in the Diet. Consequently the central states, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, von Beust being prime-minister in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and von der Pfordten of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, regarded themselves as the balance of power. Maximilian II summoned to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> Liberal and Protestant professors, nicknamed the "Northern Lights, in order to win the public opinion of all Germany for his "Triad" project. Both of the great powers strove to secure the support of the German press. The failure to secure German unity once more gave the bureaucracy of the individual states the control. It was, however, no longer able to check the growth of democratic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> among the people, and the masses were more and more influenced by the political and social movement of the times. In 1849-50 <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> underwent defeat; it then changed its programme and pursued chiefly <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> aims. These were attained partly by founding countless politico-economic associations, such as consumers' leagues, unions of dealers in raw products, and loan associations (Schulze-Delitzsch); partly, and more largely, by controlling the use of capital on a large scale. During the fifties the representatives of great capital were able, by founding large joint-stock banks, principally for the purpose of building railroads and of financing mining enterprises, to attain a leading position in German <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> life. The large landed proprietors of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> provinces east of the Elbe had also in 1848 formed an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>, the Conservative, party. They watched over agrarian interests and also aimed at restoring the old Prussian-Protestant character of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> monarchy, and the absolute sovereignty of the king. For a time incompetent leadership hindered their growth. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement soon spread among the people, though it did not constitute as yet an organized political party. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, undeceived at last as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, but without entering into relations with the Conservatives, devoted themselves chiefly to the interests of the suffering masses whose social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> needs had interested Radicalism merely as a pretext for agitation, and who had been neglected by the other parties. Thus arose the organization of journeymen's unions (<em>Gesellenvereine</em>) by Kolping of farmers' associations by Schorlermer-Alst, and the attempts to solve the labour question, which was taken up especially by <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Ketteler</a> and J&ouml;rg. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> fought against the restoration of Protestant supremacy in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> ("Catholic Fraction," 1852, <a href="../cathen/09571a.htm">Mallinckrodt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12723b.htm">Reichenspergers</a>), and in the South-West against the unwarranted control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the bureaucracy. The beginnings of Socialism resembled those of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement. The feeling of a community of interests awoke in the labouring classes; but it was not until about 1864 that Lassalle utilized this sentiment for political purposes. Throughout the fifties and sixties the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> retained the lead. As early as 1859 they deemed the time propitious for seeking to attain again to political power, without, however, any such revolutionary disturbances as in 1848. The decline of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> influence since Schwarzenberg's death (1852) encouraged them. In the Crimean War the temporizing policy of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which offended <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and did not satisfy the western powers, brought upon that country a serious diplomatic defeat, while in the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> it suffered military disaster. In both cases <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> had opposed <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> who by these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> laid the foundation of his prestige in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>The growth of large commercial enterprises in Germany widened the breach between it and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> so that in 1859 the latter was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to consent to a further postponement of its admission into the customs-union. In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> politics <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> sought to satisfy the "Great German" aspirations of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of southern and western Germany by signing the Concordat (1855). <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> and Baden also negotiated with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the subject of a Concordat; but when, in 1859, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was defeated they relinquished the project. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> discomfiture in 1859 and its failure to form an alliance with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> against <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a>, greatly excited public opinion in Germany, for the impression prevailed that Germany was menaced by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> took advantage of this to renew their agitation for the union of Germany into a single constitutional state. In 1860 the Grand Duke Frederick of Baden (1852-1907), whose land was exposed to the attacks of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, entrusted the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> with the ministry of Baden. In 1861 the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> undertook to force parliamentary government upon <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> so as to obviate all further opposition on the part of the king to the creation of a consolidated German state. They encountered, indeed, an obstinate resistance from King William I (1861-88), but the prevailing antagonism between the bureaucracy and the people caused the sympathies of almost the entire German nation to be enlisted on the side of the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>. The smaller states, becoming anxious, proposed reforms, leading to greater unity, in the constitution of the German Confederation. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, where since 1860 von Schmerling had been prime minister, also made advances to the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> in order to strengthen its position in Germany (Austrian Constitution, 1861; congress of the princes at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a>, 1863). However, the appointment of <a href="../cathen/16010b.htm">Bismarck</a> to the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ministry in the autumn of 1862, and the political organization in 1864 of Socialism by Lassalle, again checked the rising tide of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> as early as 1863-64. This was followed by Bismarck's determination to settle once and for all with the sword the antagonism existing since 1848 in German affairs between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. As <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> envoy to the Federal Diet in the fifties Bismarck had observed the instability of the lesser German states and the decline of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> strength, as well as the methods of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a>, especially the use the latter made of the principle of nationalities; but he was also able to see that since 1860 <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon's</a> star was on the wane. To a certain extent he appropriated <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon's</a> views in order that <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> might reap the fruits of what the French emperor had sown in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. At the same time he preserved an independent judgment so as to fit his measures to German conditions and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that his genius contained greater qualities and more elements of success. In the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> War (1864), fought to settle whether Schleswig and Holstein belonged to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> or Germany, he forced the Austrian minister of foreign affairs, Rechberg, to adopt his policy. He then manoeuvred <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> into a position of diplomatic isolation in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and, after forming an alliance with <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, made a furious attack upon <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1866. After two weeks of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was completely defeated at <a href="../cathen/08688b.htm">K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz</a> (3 July), and by the middle of July <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had occupied all Germany. In the meanwhile <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> had intervened. Bismarck put him off with unmeaning, verbal concessions, and in like manner pacified the German <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> whose continued opposition might hinder the carrying out of his solution of the question of German unity. He then concluded with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the Treaty of Prague (23 August, 1866) which partook of the nature of a compromise. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> separated itself entirely from Germany, the South German states were declared internationally independent, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was recognized as the leader of North Germany, while <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, Hesse-Cassel (Electoral <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>), Hesse-Nassau, Schleswig-Holstein, and Frankfurt were directly annexed to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and preliminaries were arranged for the adoption of a federal constitution by the still-existing North German states. The constitution of the North-German Confederation, established, 1 July, 1867, was framed by Bismarck so that the federal development of German constitutional law should be guarded, thus the constitution was adopted by treaties with the several sovereign princes, the autonomy of the individual states was assured, and a federal council (<em>Bundesrat</em>) was to be the representative of the various governments. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> unity of the government was guaranteed (1) by endowing <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> with large authority in administration, giving it especially the command of the army and direction of diplomatic relations; (2) by assigning foreign affairs, formation of the army, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> interests, traffic and means of communication to the authority of the confederation, the competence of which was to be gradually enlarged (the model here taken being the Federal Acts of the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of 1815); (3) by creating the Reichstag (Parliament), elected by universal, direct and equal suffrage, as the exponent of the national desire for unity. In the years immediately following the Reichstag passed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regulating the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>Bismarck considered the absence from the confederation of the South German states to be merely temporary. As early as August, 1866, he had secretly made sure of their co-operation in case of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. In 1867 he re-established the customs-union with them; politico-economic questions of common interest were, in future, to be laid before the Reichstag of the North German Confederation which, for this purpose, was to be complemented by delegates from Southern Germany so as to constitute a customs parliament. In all other respects he left diplomatic relations with the states of South Germany <em>in statu quo</em>. Attempts on their part to found a southern confederation failed. In like manner Bismarck postponed as long as possible the accounting with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in regard to the unification of Germany, although he foresaw that such an accounting was unavoidable. At a conference held in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, in 1867, he secured the neutralization of Luxembourg. In 1868 he desired to secure a resolution in favour of national unity from the customs parliament. To attain this he relied on the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> progress which, in consequence of the gradual unification of Germany, continually grew more marked and caused a complete change in a Liberal direction in the legislation on social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> questions, and in that on the administration of law, both in the North German Confederation and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Illustrations of these more liberal changes are: the organization of the postal system by Henry Stephan; introduction of freedom of trade and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to reside in any part of Germany; enactment of the penal code, 1870. Notwithstanding these results of the efforts towards union, the opposition, led by <a href="../cathen/15655a.htm">Ludwig Windthorst</a>, succeeded in obtaining a majority against him.

<p>On 19 July, 1870, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the cause being the candidature of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern for the Spanish throne. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon</a> had not been able to secure the help of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; furthermore, his army was not prepared for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Bismarck, on the contrary, fanned to white heat the national enthusiasm of Germany. The German armies quickly crossed the Rhine, and gained a firm footing on the other side by a rapid succession of victories at Weissenburg, W&ouml;rth, and the Heights of Spicheren. The main French army under Bazaine was defeated at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and shut up inside the city, 14-18 August. The army of relief under <a href="../cathen/09504c.htm">MacMahon</a> was defeated at Sedan, 1-2 September. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> became a series of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> fell, 28 September; Metz, 27 October; and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, not until 28 January. Meanwhile Gambetta had organized a national militia, 600,000 strong, which, in conjunction with the remains of the standing army, harassed and obstructed the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> on the Loire and in the North-West from October to January. On 10 May, 1871, by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a>, Alsace-Lorraine was restored to Germany as an imperial territory (<em>Reichsland</em>). The southern states had already joined the Confederation, which had become the German Empire (with an area of 208,748 sq. miles). The Constitution of the North German Confederation was adopted, with the reservation of certain privileges in favour of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. The Constitution was proclaimed 16-20 April, 1871, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> being entitled to 17 of the 58 votes in the Bundesrat or Federal Council, and to 236 of the 397 deputies in the Reichstag or Imperial Parliament. William I assumed the title of "German Emperor" at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 18 January, 1871; the office was made hereditary.
<h2 id="section6">The new German empire</h2>
<h3 id="A">1871-1888</h3>

<p>A development that had been in progress for many centuries and had been attended by many complications had practically reached its culmination; the political union of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in a single body politic, without any relinquishment of the federal principle, so far as the relations among the ruling houses were concerned, had been accomplished, advantage being taken of the popular movement towards the unification of the several States into one organic whole. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> had been excluded from Germany, the political consolidation of Northern Germany was almost complete, and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> superiority over the south had been established beyond question. For while Southern and Central Germany (with the exception of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and Nassau), as well as <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, experienced an increase in population of only about 22 to 36 per cent between 1830 and 1880, that of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> grew about 60 per cent; and nearly all the coal and ore deposits of Germany were located within the borders of the latter kingdom. Withal, during the ensuing years the united people did not devote themselves exclusively to peaceful pursuits. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> these received great attention; German commercial and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> interests throughout the world were developed; uniformity was established in weights and measures (1872), <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> (1875), the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (1879); the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the empire were codified; and after a short time close attention was also given to social problems. On the other hand, military preparations (September, 1874), in case <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should renew the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, were pushed forward with increasing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Furthermore, the old internal feuds among the religious creeds and parties were resumed with greater passion than ever in consequence of the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a> and of the organization of the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre party</a>. In all this Bismarck was the leader, while the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> constituted the government party (see <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">KULTURKAMPF</a>).

<p>It was not until 1875 that there was any degree of tranquillity and stability. Bismarck recognized that he was lessening the extraordinary esteem in which he was held by the whole world, by his excessive intimidation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Moreover, the defeat in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of the Royalists and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the Radicals and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> freed him from apprehension of danger from that quarter. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> having been estranged from the empire by his anti-French policy, Bismarck sought the friendship of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>. In 1879 he brought about an alliance with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which, when joined by <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1883, became the Triple Alliance, which still subsists &#151; the league of the great powers of Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He re-established better relations with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> by means of the secret treaty with that country in 1887. The election of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, the "pope of peace" (1878), disposed Bismarck to come to an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But as a preliminary condition he demanded either that the centre party be dissolved or that it become a government party. At the same time he contemplated sweeping changes in internal politics. The Liberal ascendancy, beginning in 1871, had been responsible for the inauguration of an excessive number of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> undertakings, resulting in the financial depression of 1873; in political finance it brought about an almost complete stagnation in the development of the systems of taxation both of the empire and the component states; in social politics it had led to a rapid increase in the ranks of the Social Democrats, who after Lassalle's death had become under Bebel and Liebknecht an international party, in which numerous anarchistic elements were blended. In 1875 there had been a fusion of the Lassalle and Bebel factions; the Gotha programme was drawn up; at the elections of 1877 they scored their first important success. <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> had also failed completely in its opposition to the Centre; the latter party had so grown that it controlled more than a quarter of the votes in the Reichstag. Bismarck determined to restrict once more the influence of the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> in domestic politics. The transformation of the Conservative faction from an old-Prussian party of landed proprietors into a German Agrarian party (1876) made it capable of further development and useful as a support for Bismarck. He purposed forming a majority by combining this Conservative party with the moderate National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> (under Bennigsen and Miquel), while at the same time, the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre party</a> having refused to disband, there was the possibility of forming a majority of the Conservatives and the Centre.

<p>Between 1876 and 1879 to organize the administration of the empire, the Reichstag created, subordinate to the chancellor, who under the Constitution was the only responsible official, the following imperial authorities or secretariats of State: Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Imperial Home Office, Imperial Ministry of Justice, Imperial Treasury, Administration of Imperial Railways, Imperial Post Office, Imperial Admiralty, Secretariat for the Colonies (1907). A number of non-political departments were also established, in part under the various secretaries of State, the chief of which was the Imperial Insurance Department; military affairs were placed under the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Minister of War. In 1879 the imperial territory of <a href="../cathen/01341c.htm">Alsace-Lorraine</a> was granted autonomy, though this was of a limited character. In 1878, after the attempts made by Hoedel and Nobiling on the life of William I, Bismarck carried out temporary measures for the suppression of Social Democratic agitation, e.g., the Socialist Law forbidding all Social Democratic organizations and newspapers. In the following year, encouraged by the increase in the sense of national unity due above all to the growth of German commerce and industry, he effected the financial and economic-political reform, his battle cry being: "Protection for German Labour!" Small protective <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were imposed upon agricultural and industrial imports, and a tariff for revenue only on colonial wares. The proceeds of both <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were to constitute the chief revenue of the empire, but of these only 130 million marks were to go to the imperial treasury, the rest being divided among the federal states, in return for which the latter, by means of federal contributions (<em>Matrikularbeitr&auml;ge</em>), were to make good the contingent deficits of the empire. During the eighties the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on agricultural products were gradually raised (especially in 1887), besides which several profitable indirect taxes, e.g., on brandy, tobacco, and stamps, were sanctioned, in order to meet the growing expenditures of the empire. In 1881 an imperial message to the Reichstag announced the inauguration of a policy of social reform in favour of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes. Between 1881 and 1889 the compulsory insurance of working-men against sickness, accident, disability, and old age was provided for by legislation. This was Bismarck's greatest achievement in domestic politics. The empire was now for the first time made the centre of the civil interests of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, who up to this time had been occupied chiefly with the doings of their restive states, the management of Church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> having been retained by these. Bismarck, now at the zenith of the second creative period of his life, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of organizing labour insurance on the basis of the community of interests of those engaged in the same work. By this means he proposed to establish in the empire self-government in social politics, which would equal in importance the local self-government of communities subordinated to the individual states, and which would complement the establishment of universal suffrage by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> the people for the administration of public affairs.

<p>Bismarck also gave his support to the great German commercial interests which insisted upon the acquisition of colonies; in 1884 South-West Africa, Kamerun, and Togo were acquired; in 1885-86 German East Africa, German <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>, and the Bismarck Archipelago. He even went so far as to risk being embroiled with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, although it was an inviolable fundamental principle of his policy not to encroach on that country's privileges. It appeared as if Bismarck, though he had grown up under wholly different conditions and had been schooled in wholly different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, entered into the spirit of the democratic German of the future, with its world-wide commerce and its world-wide <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> interests. But the first step taken, he retreated. He did not carry out his scheme of co-operative organization. It was in the fight against the growth of the German democratic tendencies within the empire that he exhausted his strength in the eighties. Domestic peace was promoted in Germany by the final though belated close of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> (1886-87); the beneficial effects of this were greatly lessened by the severity and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the measures with which Bismarck had begun (1885-86) to break up the national movement of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Poles, which was the consequence of constantly increasing prosperity and a rise of a middle class among them. Exile, efforts to suppress the Polish language, the expenditure of State funds to colonize <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> with German peasants were the means used. Incapable of respecting political parties and working in harmony with them, he became involved in incessant parliamentary contests with them. Particularly the demands of the Government for an increase in the strength of the army, which was levied by general conscription, brought him into conflict with the Centre and the Left, because of his insistence that the appropriation for army purposes should be made for a period of seven years, instead of for one year, according to the Constitution, or for the term of a parliament. Bitter quarrels also marked the debates on social questions, because Bismarck refused to agree to state protection of workmen, though he had conceded state insurance.

<p>The political parties, all of which had been organized before the creation of the empire, now began to adapt themselves to new conditions, to cast aside issues resulting from the division of Germany into separate states, and to alter their positions to conform to new points of view; but their development was seriously hampered by these conflicts. In 1879 the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> had resigned the presidency of the Reichstag in consequence of the adoption of financial and tariff reform. The president was now chosen from the Conservatives, marking the Conservative era of the empire, which down to the present time has been uninterrupted with the exception of the supremacy of the Centre from 1895 to 1906. After their fall from power, the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> repeatedly split into factions according to their differences of opinion on commercial policy. The most important section, the National Liberal party, was reorganized in 1884 by Miquel. It became reconciled with Bismarck and regained some seats in the Reichstag, but not its former power. The Conservatives energetically took up the demands for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes. Eventually the Agrarian element among them got the upper hand. They failed, however, to attract into their ranks the smaller middle class, i.e., the small retail traders who had combined to resist the great industrial interests; nor did they win over the officials of the civil service, nor the Christian Socialists among their Evangelical constituents. Consequently, small parties sprang up in the west and south of Germany that were fundamentally Conservative in character but had no connexion with the great Conservative party. The attempt that von Kleist-Retzow made to found a Protestant party of the Centre in the hope of winning over the heir to the throne, Prince William, to its cause, was frustrated by Bismarck's intrigues, by which the prince was alienated from the Conservatives. The Centre maintained its strength and directed its attention to social politics in the empire and to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> question in the individual states. It became the leading party in the Reichstag, represented by Hitze and von Hertling. In 1890 the "People's Union for Catholic Germany" (<em>Volksverein f&uuml;r das katholische Deutschland</em>) was founded. The Social Democrats, prevented by the Socialist Law from agitating their cause publicly, kept up their strength by secret recruitment. By dissolving the Reichstag in 1887, Bismarck secured the most favourable electoral results that had ever fallen to his lot, inasmuch as an overwhelming majority of Conservatives and National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> (so-called Kartell-Reichstag) was returned. But he was unable to work harmoniously even with this majority.
<h3 id="B">From 1888 to 1909</h3>

<p>In 1888 William I died. Frederick III, the hope of the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, followed him to the grave in ninety-nine days, and the reign of William II began. The youthful and able ruler wished to make Germany as speedily as possible a sharer in the world's commerce. He realized that, to attain this end, internal tranquillity was as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as external peace. He dismissed Bismarck in March 1890 and replaced him by Caprivi (1890-94). Then he saw to it that the all but unanimous desire of the Reichstag to complete the compulsory insurance legislation by comprehensive factory legislation was satisfied. An international conference for the protection of working men was held, March, 1890, and a supplementary law (Gewerbsordnungs-Novelle) was passed 1 June, 1891. He moderated the repressive measures against the Poles. He intended to give the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> a guarantee that the national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> would continue to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by the proposed National School Law in 1892, but withdrew the bill when the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> assumed a hostile attitude, and his pacific aims were thwarted. In foreign affairs he came to an understanding with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in regard to the difficulties that had arisen from the colonial expansion of Germany, e.g., the exchange of <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a> for Heligoland in 1890. In the interests of peace likewise he succeeded in concluding commercial treaties with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and several smaller states, by lowering the agricultural <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> which had become very high. With <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he sought to establish relations that were at least free from bitterness. Because of its sovereignty over the Balkans and the East, he devoted special attention to Germany's political relations to Turkey. For he saw that these countries were the best markets for German trade. But trouble soon began. The emperor's autocratic proclivities and his sudden changes of opinion aroused bitter criticism among the people. The new Army Bill of 1893, which proposed to reduce the period of military service to two years, was well-meant on his part, but was so badly managed that it brought him into collision with the Centre (Dissolution of the Reichstag, 1893). On the other hand, the commercial treaties, which were opposed by the agricultural party, got the emperor into difficulties with the Conservatives. In 1895 the Reichstag turned a deaf ear to his demands for renewal of sharp repressive measures against agitations that were "hostile to the state" (the so-called "Umsturzvorlage"). His views subsequently became liberalized, his following being recruited mainly from the commercial, industrial, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> classes (Krupp, Ballin, Harnack).

<p>The success of the emperor's policy during the next few years dispelled the clouds of opposition, especially as Caprivi's successor, Chlodwig Hohenlohe (1894-1901), was a man of astute and conciliatory nature, while in Count Posadowsky, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, the emperor had the support of an extremely competent and energetic man. Germany became Turkey's chief counsellor. The maintenance of friendly relations with the rapidly developing <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, despite the opposition of their economical interests and isolated instances of friction between officers, strengthened public confidence in the international situation. By the occupation of Kiao-chau in 1898, Germany secured a footing in Eastern <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, while the partition of the Samoan Islands and the acquisition of the Carolines (1898-9) gave her a much-desired increase of stations in the Pacific. The German transatlantic merchant marine held for a long period the record for the race across the Atlantic, and, even in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, Germany promised to become a very serious rival of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The last decade of the nineteenth century was a period of exceptional prosperity throughout the country. From forty-one millions in 1871, the population increased to sixty millions in 1905. The increased national well-being will be realized from the fact that at present the gross value of the agricultural produce amounts to some $3,525,000,000, and of the industrial output to about $8,460,000,000. In 1871, two-thirds of the population still lived in the country, whereas in 1900 54.3 per cent lived in towns of more than 2000 inhabitants, and in 1905 19 per cent lived in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants. In the agricultural districts, however, conditions continued to be healthy &#151; 31 per cent being cultivated by peasants, 24 per cent being held in large estates, and the remainder in lots of less than 20 hectares (roughly 50 acres). The woodland area still includes one-fourth of the total area.

<p>During this period the national standard of living became more luxurious; revolutionary and anarchistic tendencies began appreciably to disappear. The whole nation was seized by a burning tendency towards the formation of new associations, a spirit to which we owe the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> People's Union (der Volksverein: members in 1908, 600,000), the Farmers' League (1908: 300,000 members), the free (Socialistic) guilds (1908: over 750,000 members), the Christian Endeavour guilds (1908: over 200,000 members), etc. In Parliament, the great political parties (Conservatives, National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, and the Centre) drew closer together; the presidency devolved on the Centre in consequence of its numerical preponderance and the ability of its leaders. In 1899, the constantly recurring conflict between the Crown and the Reichstag on the subject of appropriations for military expenditure was settled by an agreement on the part of the legislative assembly to vote supplies henceforth for the parliamentary period, which had been increased from three to five years in 1888. Among the important measures passed were the completion of the unified legal codes (1896) and the Naval Acts (1898, 1901), which had in view the raising of Germany to a maritime power of the first rank. In 1902 the resolution to restore the high protective <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on agricultural products was passed in the face of the bitter opposition maintained by the Social Democrats for many months (Tariff Bills, on the basis of which the commercial treaties were renewed in 1905). <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> project of constructing a canal through her own territory from the Oder to the Rhine met with obstinate resistance, not indeed in the Reichstag, but in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Diet (rejected in 1899, approved in 1903). In the midst of this era of prosperity Bismarck died (1898).

<p>In foreign politics, however, there came a change for the worse after <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England's</a> subjugation of the Boers. Under Edward VII, Great Britain forced Germany back from almost all the positions which she had recently occupied. Meanwhile, William II devoted himself to a line of policy calculated to win temporary favour (journey to Jerusalem, 1898; intervention in the Chinese complications, 1900; landing in Tangier, 1905). Prince Buelow, who replaced Hohenlohe in 1900, was unable to stem the ebbing tide. In the Moroccan controversy between Germany and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Germany, who appealed to an international conference (at Algeciras, 1906), suffered a severe rebuff. By his efforts to separate <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from the Triple Alliance and by his ententes with the other Powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Edward VII isolated his rival (1907, Triple-Entente between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). Buelow's Polish policy, which was more drastic even than Bismarck's (cf. the Expropriation Act of 1908), resulted only in disappointments without effectually checking the Polish disturbances. In 1907, owing in part to the financial crisis in America, Germany's commercial prosperity markedly declined. Favoured by the customs tariff, agriculture alone continued to flourish. The revenue of the empire decreased with the commercial profits. At the same time the rising of the Herreros in South-Western Africa in 1904 called for large unforeseen expenditures, while the troubled aspect of the foreign situation necessitated a tremendous increase in the outlay on armaments (cf. Naval statutes of 1908. The "ordinary" expenditure in 1907 was 2329 millions of marks; National <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> in 1873: 1800 millions, and in 1908, 4400 millions of marks.) One attempt after another was made at fiscal reform [1904, relaxation of the Franckenstein clause; 1906, 150 million marks ($35,250,000) yearly taxes were voted; in 1908-09, 500 millions were demanded by the government], but the government is still carried on with a deficit. Thorough recovery has been prevented by the renewed violent dissensions in the nation by party spirit (since 1892) and the clash of opposing ideals.

<p>The coalition, which had formed the majority during the nineties, broke up in 1903. Its most important factor was the Centre, the number of whose seats in the Reichstag and supporters in the constituencies remained stationary even during the period of its parliamentary ascendancy. Therein lay its weakness, since meanwhile its allies, the official Liberal and Conservative parties, gained ground. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> gained in consequence of a movement towards concentration among the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> of the Left soon after the beginning of the century (Fusion of the Liberal of the Left, 1906), and of a reconciliation between the National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> of the Left by means of a "Young Liberal" movement in their ranks. The Conservatives, who had been growing as a party almost uninterruptedly since 1876, especially after the founding of the "Farmers' League" in 1893, gained by gradually invading the agrarian territory in the west and south-west.

<p>Up to 1906, the Protestant League, founded in 1886, maintained a fanatical agitation amongst the populace to frustrate the endeavours of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, directed through the Centre, to secure recognition of their equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as citizens in the public life of the nation. Yielding to this agitation, first the National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> then the Conservatives dissociated themselves from the Centre. Despite its utmost efforts, the Centre failed in 1906 to secure the repeal of the remainder of the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> Laws, except to the extent of the two paragraphs of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> law (i.e., the expulsion clauses). Furthermore, the so-called "toleration bills," in which the Centre strove by imperial legislation to fix the minimum of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to be conceded to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the separate states, although repeatedly presented to the Reichstag after 1900, always met with defeat. When, in 1906, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character of the national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was finally established by statute in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> after an interval of 13 years, the Government drafted the bill in accordance with the wishes of the Conservatives and the National <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, and left to the Centre only the right of voting for it.

<p>Another important factor in bringing about the cleavage between the parties was the spread among the wealthier classes, both Liberal and Conservative, of a strong feeling of opposition to further social legislation. This feeling found an outlet in the formation of influential syndicates, and was most bitterly directed against the Centre, as the principal promoter of social remedial measures. An open breach between the parties took place on the question of a relatively insignificant colonial budget. The Government immediately disowned the Centre, and dissolved the Reichstag (13 December, 1906). Since then the situation has been very complicated. As a result of the elections the Centre retained its former voting strength, but was isolated. The Government formed a new coalition, called "the Block," consisting of the Conservatives and the united Liberal party &#151; the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> of the Left had hitherto been in opposition. In this it relied on the feelings of hostility towards the Centre which animated the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and the propertied classes. When the administration, however, made concessions to Liberal principles (extension of the right of association, partial repeal of the stock exchange legislation, promise to introduce popular suffrage into <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>), the Conservatives, after some hesitation, decided to oppose the Government so again sought an alliance with the Centre. They are stronger than the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, but the sympathies of the Government and of the Anti-Catholic portion of the population will help the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> in their contests with the Conservatives. The quarrel amongst the civil parties prevents the further loss of parliamentary seats by the Social Democrats, whose voting power has been steadily increasing since 1890 (in 1907 they cast 3,259,000 votes, 29 per cent of the total, although they won only forty-three seats in the Reichstag as compared with eighty-one in 1903). It also prevents the reconstruction of the programme of the Socialists, many of whom &#151; especially in South Germany &#151; favour a peaceful transformation of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The difference of opinions existing among the Socialist party was clearly evidenced by the violent quarrel between the opposing sections at the Dresden Convention in 1903.

<p>The position of the Government in view of its relations with the parties is at present (Jan., 1909) not very favourable. The administrative organization of the empire hardly suffices. Besides, the shock given to the power of the emperor in November, 1908, in consequence of the popular resentment of his personal interference in politics as revealed in the "Daily Telegraph" interview, has not served to strengthen the Government. On the other hand, its prestige was greatly enhanced by the re-establishment of German influence in international politics, owing to its firm support of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> in the Balkan crisis (1908-9). It has put an end to the isolation of Germany, strengthened the bonds of the Triple Alliance, and promises to result in a rapprochement with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>.

<p>In dealing with the present situation of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> must be separated from the question of the civic <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The authorities of the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> work together in a spirit of mutual benevolence, the chief credit for which is due to Cardinal Kopp, since 1886 Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. Ecclesiastically speaking, Germany is divided into 5 archbishoprics, 14 suffragan and 6 exempt <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, 3 Apostolic vicariates, and 2 Apostolic prefectures. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are trained for the most part by 15 <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> or lyceum faculties (the most recently established being at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 1902), a smaller number in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Ecclesiastical affairs are not regulated by the empire but by the individual state. In <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> they rest on the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De Salute Animarum" and the explanatory brief "Quodde Fidelium" of 1821 (although the promise of land endowment for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> has not been kept), on the constitution of 1850, and on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1886-87 regulating <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> polity. In <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, they rest on the Statute of 1862, in Baden on the Statutes of 1860, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> on the Concordat of 1817, which has not actually been enforced and which consequently creates a state of legal uncertainty. In these divisions of the empire, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a privileged corporation. In the Kingdom of Saxony and in Saxe-Weimar, all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ordinances and appointments, even those issued from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as well as the erection of new churches, etc., are subject to the approval of the Government. Appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is forbidden. In the other small Thuringian states, and in <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a> and Mecklenburg, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> even recently had to submit their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> affairs to the authority of the Protestant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and in part <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> even now pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the Protestant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> for this unsought-for service. The building of churches and establishment of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are also subject to galling restrictions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are elected by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, except in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (where they are chosen by agreement between the Government and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>); in the Upper Rhenish church province, in <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> method of election obtains; elsewhere exists the customary submission of a list of candidates to the Government. The establishment of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> is everywhere subject to the approval of the State. In <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> and Baden only <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders are allowed; in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and the smaller Protestant States only nursing sisterhoods. <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> institutions are not permitted anywhere. The primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are mostly denominational, but are neutral in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, in part of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and in two provinces of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. They are founded by the State and by the communities, but the local <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> supervise the religious instruction and are generally the local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> inspectors. The system of intermediate and higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys is undenominational almost without exception, and is under either state or municipal control; the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls are mostly under private and denominational management, being largely conducted by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> takes precedence of the religious by an imperial law of 1875; <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> is regulated by the civil code. For <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> couples separation <em>a mens&acirc; et thoro</em> may be granted. Charitable relief work is admirably regulated and carefully stimulated by the focusing of charitable impulses in the <em>Charitasverband</em> (Charity Organization Society), founded at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in 1897. It is working more and more in harmony with social relief work. There is a large number of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>; the throngs who assist at all religious festivals are impressive, and the numbers who receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are gratifying. Pilgrimages are numerously attended, the most famous place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> being Kevelaer, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> Alt&ouml;tting. Considerable anxiety is inspired by the prevalence of Social Democracy in certain districts, and by the irreligious indifference of the rising generation of the propertied classes.

<p>The civil status of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is not so good. Of the 60,641,272 inhabitants of Germany in 1905, about 36.00 per cent were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (in 1900 only 36.1 per cent as compared with 36.2 per cent in 1871). At present, as formerly, unity infuses life into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are splendidly organized (for politics by the Centre and in <a href="../cathen/14115a.htm">sociological</a> respect by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> guilds and by Volksverein). They are making persistent efforts to secure equal recognition in public life (cf. the agitation afoot in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> since 1890 in favour of equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the so-called "Self-examination Movement" throughout the empire, that is to say, the general investigation into the injustices suffered by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and economical life of the country). Recently, the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pupils in the intermediate and higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> has increased, but only on the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> side. Their representation in the poly-technic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as well as in the student bodies at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> continues to be weak, out of all proportion to those of the other communions. Only in isolated instances are the leading positions in the states and communities filled by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. No <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> state minister, and only one state secretary is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Their share in the public wealth does not at all correspond with their numerical strength.
