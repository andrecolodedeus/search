<p>DIOCESE OF GERONA (GERUNDENSIS)

<p>The Diocese of Geronia in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, is bounded on the north by the Pyrenees, on the south and east by the Mediterranean, and on the west by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Barcelona and <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>. The district is mountainous, with forests of pine, oak, and chestnut, and numerous mineral springs. Several of the towns are manufacturing centres, and the main railway from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to Barcelona runs through the province, which possesses considerable commercial importance. Its coal mines are a source of wealth, but agriculture is not in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. The episcopal city of Gerona is the chief town of the province of the same name, and it situated at the confluence of the Ter and the Ona. The ancient portion of the city with its once-formidable fortifications stands on the steep hill of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, while the more modern section is in the plain and stretches beyond the river. The bastions of the walls which have withstood so many sieges are still to be seen.

<p>Gerona is the ancient <em>Gerunda</em>, a city of the Ausetani. It is said that Sts. Paul and James, on their arrival in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, first preached <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there, and tradition also has it that St. Maximus, a disciple of St. James, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the district. It is generally held that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was erected in 247. On 18 June, 517, a synod was convened here, and attended by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> and six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Canons were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> dealing with the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>. The city has undergone twenty-five sieges and been captured seven times. In the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> it was wrested temporarily from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, who were driven out finally in 1015. It was besieged by the French under Marshal Hocquisicourt in 1653, under Marshal Bellefonds in 1684, and twice in 1694 under <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">de Noailles</a>. In May, 1809, it was besieged by 35,000 French troops under Vergier, Augereau, and St. Cyr, and held out obstinately under the leadership of Alvarez until disease and famine compelled it to capitulate, 12 December.

<p>The ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which stood on the site of the present one, was used by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> as a mosque, and after their final expulsion was either entirely remodelled or rebuilt. The present edifice is one of the noblest monuments of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Majorcan architect, Jayme Fabre, and one of the finest specimens of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It is approached by eighty-six steps. An aisle and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> surround the choir, which opens by three arches into the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, of which the pointed stone vault is the widest in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> (73 feet). Among its interior decorations is a retable which is the work of the Valencian silversmith Peter Bernec. It is divided into three tiers of statuettes and reliefs, framed in canopied niches of cast and hammered silver. A gold and silver <a href="../cathen/01353b.htm">altar-frontal</a> was carried off by the French in 1809. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Raymond B&eacute;renger and his wife. The Collegiate Church of San Feliu is also architecturally noteworthy. Its style is fourteenth-century Gothic, the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the eighteenth, and it is one of the few Spanish churches which possesses a genuine spire. It contains, besides the sepulchre of its patron and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the valiant Alvarez, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to St. Narcissus, who according to tradition was one of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> church of San Pedro de los Gallos is in Romanesque style of an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Francisco Pol y Baralt was born at Arenys de Mar in the Diocese of Gerona, 9 June, 1854. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 373 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 780 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 325,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Olot, and among the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are those of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, the Augustinian, and the <a href="../cathen/03320a.htm">Capuchin nuns</a>.
