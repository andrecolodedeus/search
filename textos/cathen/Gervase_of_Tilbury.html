<h1>Gervase of Tilbury</h1>  

<p>(TILBERIENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> writer, b. probably at Tilbury, in the County of Essex, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, about 1150; d. at Arlington, about 1220. He is supposed to have been related to English royalty. During his youth he entered the service of Henry of Guienne, later he travelled in many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, for a time studied canon law at Bologna, where for a brief period he also taught, and was afterwards at the court of King William II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> till 1189. Upon the death of King William he settled permanently in Arles and was appointed Marshal of the Kingdom of Arles in 1198 by King <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>; in virtue of this office he accompanied the king to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1209 on the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> as emperor. During the years 1210-1214 he composed the "Otia imperialia" for the instruction and entertainment of the emperor, who was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the latter part of 1210, and in 1214, after his defeat at the battle of Bouvines, was forced to retire to the principality of <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>. This work was also entitled "Liber de mirabilibus mundi", "Solatia imperatoris", and "Descriptio totius orbis". It was divided into three parts, and contained all facts then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> concerning history, geography, and <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was much read and was twice translated into French in the fourteenth century. Opinions differ in modern times concerning its value. <a href="../cathen/09134b.htm">Leibniz</a> calls it a "bagful of foolish old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> tales"; while by others it is considered very important since in it this <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> teacher of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> recognizes the correctness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims in the conflict between <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and Empire.

<p>Leibniz edited it (1744) in his "Scriptores rerum Brunsvicensium" (I, 881-1004) with variants from four <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and a supplement (II, 751-784). Its account of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> and English kings is included by Duchesne in his "Historiae Francorum scriptores coaetanei" (I, 19; III, 363-74). Mader edited the same portion in his "De Imperio Romano et Gothorum, Langobardorum, Brittonum, Francorum Anglorumque regnis commentatio" (Helmstadt, 1673). Liebrecht edited a number of <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">geographical</a> and physical excerpts from it (Hanover, 1856). The references to Virgil were published by Spatzier [Altenglische Marchen (Brunswick, 1830), I, 89-92]. Many of the writings of Gervase have perished. He was formerly reputed to be the author of the "Antiquus dialogus de scaccario", but many critics now ascribe the work to another writer.
