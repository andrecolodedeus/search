<h1>Gesta Dei per Francos</h1>  

<p>Gesta Dei per Francos is the title adopted by Guibert de Nogent (died about 1124) for his history of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. In the eleventh century the name of "Frank" was applied in a general manner to all the inhabitants of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, being a survival of the political unity established by the Carolingians for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. The Byzantine chroniclers never otherwise refer to the Westerns. Herv&eacute;, a Norman adventurer in the service of the Byzantine emperors in the eleventh century, is called "Francopoulos" (Son of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>). It was therefore quite natural that this name of "Frank" should be used by the Orientals in referring to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, and it is evident that they called themselves by the same name. "Gesta Francorum" is the title of one of the chief accounts of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> the word Frank remains in the east a synonym for Western, and today the term is still used in that sense. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> were a people chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> arose soon after their conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and finds expression many times in the traditions relative to <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, which <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> transmits to us. We read in one of the prologues of the Salic Law: "Glory to Christ, who loves the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>! May He preserve their kingdom! May He replenish their leaders with His grace, for this is the strong and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> nation which has richly covered with gold the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>." With <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> protected the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> from the Lombard invasion, destroyed <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> among the Saxons, drove back the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, and established their protectorate over the Holy Sepulchre. Hence the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was, for the men of the eleventh century, merely the crowning of that alliance between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and after the discourse of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, it was to the cry of "God wills it!" that all made haste to take the cross.

<p>Guibert, born in Picardy about 1053, was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Saint-Germer-de-Fly, elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Nogent-sous-Coucy in 1104, had been a witness of the enthusiasm aroused by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, perhaps he had even assisted at the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>. Desiring to write an account of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, he chose this title of the "Doings of God through the Franks", and in his account, wherein the marvellous occasionally mingles with reality, he affirms at different times the Divine mission of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. This work, dedicated to Gaudri, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon, is not an original account of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and in part follows the anonymous author of the "Gesta Francorum". It is nevertheless not without great value, for it shows the profound impression created throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the conquest of the Holy Land. Although Guibert was a contemporary of the events which he relates, they receive already in his account an epic colouring. The interest of these seven books, composed between 1108-1112 consists in their revealing to us the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the providential r&ocirc;le, which the men of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> assigned to the Westerns, but in Guibert's mind the only <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> worth considering were his compatriots, the French. To them the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> turned when they suffered injuries inflicted by other nations, and he contrasts their conduct with that of the Teutons, in revolt against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He therefore considers the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> as a wholly French undertaking (Bk. II, i). When, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, Jacques Bongars (1546-1612) undertook to publish the works of all the known historians of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, he chose as the title of his collection "Gesta Dei per Francos" (Hanover, 2 v., 1612).
