<h1>Gheeraert David</h1>  

<p>Son of John David, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and illuminator, b. at Oudewater, South <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, c. 1450, d. 13 August, 1523, at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, where he had been admitted, 14 January, 1484, as master-painter into the Guild of St. Luke, of which, after filling minor offices, he was elected dean in 1501. It is not known where he learned his art, probably at <a href="../cathen/07095a.htm">Haarlem</a>. On the completion of his apprenticeship, he no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as was the custom, travelled to improve himself, working as an assistant under various masters wherever he found employment. He probably travelled to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, as his works show traces of Florentine and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> influence. Their landscape backgrounds prove that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the valley of the Meuse. On his way to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> he would not have failed to visit <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and study the works of his fellow-countryman, Dirk Bouts, nor to halt a while at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> to admire the polyptych of the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eycks</a>. At <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> he found the churches full of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by all the great masters, and one of these, <a href="../cathen/10172c.htm">Hans Memling</a>, still living. He probably worked under him until he himself received commissions, for which he had not long to wait. In 1496 he married Cornelia Cnoop, daughter of the dean of the guild of goldsmiths, by whom he had one daughter, Barbara. Gheeraert was buried in the church of Our Lady, at the foot of the tower. He was not one of the greatest masters, nor did he strike out any new line like Van der Goes, but he gathered up all the best traditions of his predecessors, to which he faithfully adhered all through his life. His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> compared with those of <a href="../cathen/10172c.htm">Memling</a> are more sedate. One new type he created, the charming figure of the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which made a lasting impression on the succeeding generation of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. His portraits are very good, his brocaded stuffs, <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, and jewellery have never been surpassed, and his landscapes are remarkably fine. His works show that he was a great religious <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>; he was also a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and charitable man. One of his finest <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, the "Virgo inter Virgines", now in the museum at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, was presented by him in 1509 to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Sion at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, to whom he lent a large sum of money free of interest. Gheeraert excelled in miniature-painting and illumination, which arts his wife also practised with success. David's principal works are in the National Gallery, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (2), National Gallery, Dublin (1), Town Gallery, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> (5), Town Gallery, Rouen (1), Museum, Sigmaringen (2), Imperial Gallery, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1).
