<h1>Ghent</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF GHENT (GANDENSIS or GANDAVENSIS).

<p>The Diocese of Ghent at present comprises the whole territory of East <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, one of the nine provinces of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. It numbers 1,103,930 inhabitants and 362 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was erected by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> ("Super universi", 12 May, 1559) at the request of Philip II, King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Sovereign of the Low Countries. Till that time Ghent had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Diocese of Tournai</a>. Situated on the left bank of the Scheldt (Escaut), the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was bounded on the north by the western arm of that river, on the east by the new Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> and <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, detached from <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, on the south by Tournai, and on the west by the new <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Diocese of Bruges</a> ("Ex injuncto", <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, 1560, and "Regimini universalis Ecclesiae" especially for Ghent, 7 August, 1561). Previous to this <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> had obtained from <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> the secularization of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Abbey of Saint-Bavon, at Ghent (22 July, 1536), and in 1541 they transferred their chapter from the ancient <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church of St. John the Baptist, which henceforth bore the name of Saint-Bavon. In 1559 it was decided that this chapter should become that of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and that at the death of Viglius, then mitred <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of said chapter, the revenues of the abbacy, or provostship, should become the episcopal revenues.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">concordat</a> between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and the First Consul, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> called upon all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to resign their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Prince de Lobkowitz, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ghent, had died at M&uuml;nster in 1795 and had not been replaced. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Qui Christi Domini" (29 November, 1801), <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> suppressed all the ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> throughout the French Republic, and erected sixty new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, among which he re-established that of Ghent, comprising the two departments of Escaut and Lys, i.e. the three ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Ghent, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and Ypres, to which was added a portion of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> detached the part appertaining to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (25 August, 1832), and by the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">See of Bruges</a> (27 May, 1834), determined the present <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Diocese of Ghent. Ghent has had twenty-four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of whom the last is Mgr Antoine* Stillemans, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 27 January, 1890. Among them, <a href="../cathen/08284b.htm">Cornelius Jansenius</a> and Antoine* Triest are deserving of more special notice.

<p>The former, who must not be confounded with <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres</a>, the author of the "Augustinus", was professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> when Philip II sent him as his representative to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, he was named by the king first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ghent, in 1568, and this <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> on 6 July of the same year. His numerous and learned commentaries on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> reveal in him an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> of great merit. The seventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Antoine* Triest, occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from 1622 to 1657. He was a veritable M&aelig;cenas and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Saint-Bavon is indebted to him for most of the masterpieces which adorn it. His generosity towards the poor found expression in important charitable foundations and in the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which he displayed in the establishment at Ghent of the Mont de Pi&eacute;t&eacute;, an institution founded to lend to the poor without interest. Bishop Triest bequeathed considerable sums to this work. In 1813, during the episcopate of the Prince de Broglie (1807-1821), the seminarians of Ghent offered an heroic resistance to the despotism of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. The emperor held the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and twice sought to wrest from him his resignation. He undertook to name a successor, and sent as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ghent a canon of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, M. de la Brue de Saint-Bauzille, but all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, with the exception of thirty out of a thousand <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, refused to recognize him. Being called upon to submit to the intruder, the seminarians opposed an energetic refusal, were compelled to enter the imperial regiments, and were taken, some to Wesel, the others to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Many subsequently died at Wesel as a result of contagious diseases and privations of every sort, but remained faithful to their motto: "Rather soldiers than schismatics".

<p>During the episcopate of Mgr Delebecque (1838-64) nine American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent two of their colleagues to ask <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the Diocese of Ghent, intending to place under their direction and instruction the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which they proposed to found at Troy, New York. Mgr Delebecque acceded to this request, and in the month of August, 1864, MM. van den Hende, Gabriels (now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>), Roelants, and Puissant embarked for America. The Diocese of Ghent continued its collaboration in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Troy until July, 1896. It was also at Ghent and under the auspices of Mgr Delebecque that the work was founded, in 1859, which is now known as <em>le Denier de Saint Pierre</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's Pence</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Ghent Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Van de Velde (1743-1823) is most deserving of notice. While he acquired a well-merited reputation as professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and his published and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> works place him in the front rank of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his time, he is chiefly entitled to notice for the important part which he played in the religious affairs of his country, first, under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, by his intrepid opposition to the decrees with regard to marriage (1784), and later, under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, by his decisive intervention at the national council, which the emperor assembled at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1811, and where, as the counsellor of Mgr de Broglie, he presented a "M&eacute;moire sur l'incomp&eacute;tence du concile national &agrave; changer la discipline de l'&Eacute;glise, en vertu de laquelle le Pape seul donne l'institution canonique aux &eacute;v&ecirc;ques nomm&eacute;s" (Memorandum concerning the incompetency of the national council to alter the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, in virtue of which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone confers <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> on the nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>).

<p>One who was well entitled to be called "the Vincent de Paul of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>" also deserves mention. The inexhaustible charity of Canon Pierre-Joseph Triest (1760-1836) was extended to all human miseries, and for their more efficacious relief he founded in succession the Sisters of Charity (1803), the Brothers of Charity (1807), the "Association of Maternal Charity" (1822), the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Brothers of St. John of God</a> (1825), and the Sisters of the Holy Childhood of Jesus (1835).

<p>We shall speak only of the first and second of these institutions, the development of which was truly extraordinary. The Sisters of Charity now number more than 1300, and their benevolent activity is spread throughout <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the Congo, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (Punjab), and Ceylon, they are engaged not only in the instruction of children, but give intelligent and devoted care to deaf mutes, the insane and incurables. In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> more than 6000 infirm are sheltered in their houses. The <a href="../cathen/03604a.htm">Congregation of the Brothers of Charity</a>, which numbers about 1000 religious, is spread throughout <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and has been extended successively to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. At present it possesses 44 establishments where more than 6000 insane, aged, and sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and many other unfortunates are cared for. The Brothers teach and care for more than 11,000 children and poor youths, 440 deaf mutes and blind <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, 450 youthful delinquents and 1000 foundlings.

<p>Truly remarkable religious monuments of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Saint-Bavon and the churches of Saint-Nicholas, Saint-Jacques, and Saint-Michel at Ghent, the church of Saint-Martin at Alost, and the churches of Notre-Dame and Sainte-Walburge at Oudenarde. From an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> point of view the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Saint-Bavon at Ghent is one of the most beautiful churches in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and is undoubtedly the richest in objects of art. Among its numerous works of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Bishop Triest, by J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Duquesnoy, is incontestably the masterpiece, and has been rightfully called "the most beautiful work of national statuary". The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Ghent is deservedly famous for the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> of the brothers <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Hubert and Jan Van Eyck</a>, known as "The Adoration of the Lamb", which was completed in 1432. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> now possesses only the central panel of the picture, the most important portion of the work. The side panels are at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. [<em>Note:</em> The Ghent alterpiece, after many trials and tribulations during reformation and two world <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, is on display in the Ghent Cathedral (Saint Bavo). In 1934 the panel depicting the Just Judges was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> and never recovered. It is now substituted with a copy.]
