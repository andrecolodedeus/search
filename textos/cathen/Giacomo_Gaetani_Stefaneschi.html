<h1>Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about 1270; died at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 23 June, 1343. He was the son of the senator Pietro Stefaneschi and his wife, Perna Orsini. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was sent to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> to pursue higher studies. After three years of diligent application he received the degree of Master of Arts, and intended to devote himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, having already begun to teach at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, when his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> recalled him to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in order that he should study canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. He was highly esteemed by <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a>, who made him canon of St. Peter's and auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>; and was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a> of the titular Church of San Giorgio in Velabro, 17 Dec., 1295, by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, who also sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a>, <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, and Bologna in 1296, to suppress civil disturbances. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> appointed him protector of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, 23 July, 1334. He was never <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p>Stefaneschi is best known as the author of "Opus Metricum", a life of <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> composed in dactylic hexameter. Abstracting from a short autobiography left in his cell by <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine</a> when he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the "Opus Metricum" of Stefaneschi is the earliest biography of the hermit-pontiff. It is composed of three parts, each complete in itself and written at a different time. In 1319 the author united these three separate poems into one work and sent it with a dedicatory epistle to the prior and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of San Spirito at Sulmona, the mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/16020a.htm">Celestines</a>. The first part contains in three books an account of the election, reign, and abdication of <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine</a>. It was written before Stefaneschi became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The second part describes in two books the election and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and was written five years later, when Stefaneschi was already <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The third part is composed of three books and describes the life of <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine</a> after he had abdicated, his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The poem is preceded by an introduction in prose, which contains valuable data of the author's life and a synopsis of the whole work. Though of great historical value, the poem is devoid of all literary excellence, and at times is even extremely clumsy and barbarous. It was first edited by Papebroch, "Acta SS.", IV, May, 436-483. A new edition by Professor Sdralek of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> is in course of preparation. The other works of Stefaneschi are: "Liber de Centesimo sive Jubileo", edited by Quattrocchi in "Bessarione" (Rome, 1900, VII, 299-317), an interesting and historically important account of the first Roman Jubilee, held in 1300; "Liber ceremoniarum Curi&aelig; Roman&aelig;", a book of ceremonies to be observed at the Roman Court, edited according to a highly interpolated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in "Museum Italicum" (II, 243-443), re-edited in part by Ehrle in "Archiv f&uuml;r Literatur und Kirchengeschichte" (V, 565-587), and by Labande in "Biblioth&egrave;que de l'&eacute;cole des chartes" (LIV, 45-74); "Vita S. Georgii Martyris", a eulogy on <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>, the patron of Stefaneschi's titular church; and "Historia de miraculo Mari&aelig; facto Avinione", a short narrative of how a young man, who had been condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> delivered by the Virgin Mary.
