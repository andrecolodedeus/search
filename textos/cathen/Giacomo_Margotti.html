<h1>Giacomo Margotti</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publicist, born 11 May, 1823; died 6 May, 1887. He was a native of San Remo, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was president of the Chamber of Commerce, and there he studied the classics and philosophy, after which he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15343a.htm">Ventimiglia</a>; in 1845, he obtained the doctorate at the University of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and was received into the Royal Academy of Superga, where he remained until 1849. Already in 1848, in company with Mgr. Moreno, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, <a href="../cathen/02070b.htm">Professor Audisio</a>, and the Marquis Birago, he had established the daily paper "L'Armonia", which soon had other distinguished contributors; among them, <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> and Marquis Gustavo, brother of Cavour; the managing editor, however, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the publication, was Margotti, whose writings combined soundness of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with rare purity of style, while his ready ability for reply, and the brilliancy of his polemics made him feared by the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> government, which at that moment, in furtherance of its policy of territorial expansion, had entered upon a course of legislation that was hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and at variance with the wishes of a great majority of the people. As a result, Margotti underwent frequent trials, and was often subjected to fines and to other impositions; and in 1859, Cavour suppressed the "L'Armonia". This publication was replaced by "Il Piemonte"; but when the period of agitation passed, "L'Armonia" reappeared; its name was changed, however, conformably with the wish of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, on the twenty-fifth of December, 1863, after which date it was called "L'Unit&agrave; Cattolica". On the other hand, Margotti continued to be the object of attacks and of plots, and once, at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, an attempt was made upon his life; but nothing intimidated him; while his journalistic proficiency was eulogized by the "British Review" in its issue for August, 1865.

<p>For a long time, the opinion of Margotti on questions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interest had the force of <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and if he was not the author of the axiom "n&egrave; eletti, n&egrave; elettori" &mdash; "be neither elector nor elected" &mdash; he, more effectually than any one else, presented its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to convince them that, in the face of revolutionary triumphs, it was idle to hope for a successful reaction through parliament; in which he was in accordance with the views of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who, in 1868, said to Margotti that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should not go to the ballot-box: "Non si vada alle urne". He was foreign to all sense of personal aggrandizement; <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, referring to this fact, once said "Margotti never asked me for anything: he was right for any dignity that I could have conferred upon him would have been inferior to his merits". By his will Margotti left nearly 100,000 lire for charitable purposes. Besides the articles in "L'Unit&agrave;", Margotti wrote "Il processo di Nepomuceno Nuytz, prof. di Diritto Canonico nella Universit&agrave; di Torino" (1851); "Considerazioni sulla separazione dello Stato dalla Chiesa in Piemonte" (1855); "Le vittorie della Chiesa nei primi anni del Pontificato di Pio IX (1857); "Memorie per la storia dei nostri tempi" (1863, 6 vols.); "Le consolazioni del S. P. Pio IX" (1863); "Pio IX e il suo episcopato nelle diocesi di Spoleto e d'Imola" (1877).
