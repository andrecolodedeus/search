<h1>Gian Matteo Giberti</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, the natural son of Francesco Giberti, a <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> naval captain, b. at Palermo in 1495; d. at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, 30 Dec., 1543. In 1513 he was admitted to the household of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, and advanced so rapidly in Latin and Greek that he soon became an eminent member of the "Accademia Romana". Later he was appointed the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> secretary, and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, with whom he had political dealings, valued his opinions and advice very highly. In 1521 he was chief intermediary with the envoy of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. He used his great influence over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to protect and help struggling men of letters. The choicest intellects met at his house. He led a severely <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and was a member of the <em>Sodalitium Divini Amoris</em> of <a href="../cathen/03145a.htm">St. Cajetan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03329a.htm">Cardinal Caraffa</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the death of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, he was sent by Cardinal Giulio, his <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a>, on a mission to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>. <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> immediately after his election made him Datario (1523), and in 1524, at the request of the Doge of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. Being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, against his will, to remain in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he had himself represented at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> by a very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Giberti was chosen a member of the Reform Committee <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a>, but political events soon put an end to these labours. At Pavia (1525) he tried to make peace between <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. It was at his prompting that <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> espoused the cause of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; the League of Cognac (22 May, 1526) was also his work. After the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1527) he was made to feel the vengeance of the Imperialists; being one of the hostages, he was put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and barely escaped death. He succeeded in making his escape, and went to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (1528) intending to devote himself entirely to the ruling of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was done with politics, all the more because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had gone over to the imperial cause. However, he appeared from time to time in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> recalled him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the work of the Reform Committee; among other missions he was sent to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> to make preparations for the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">council</a>. His wise and unwearying efforts to reform his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were in a deplorabgstate, were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with unhoped-for success. In that see <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reforms</a> were put in force long before the council assembled. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, before taking charge of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, wished to study Giberti's system at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and chose as his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> trained in Giberti's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. His first aim was to improve the standard of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In his own palace he set up a printing-press which turned out many splendid editions of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, in whose writings he was very learned. He reformed the choir-school of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> which had long been famous; for the instruction of the young he had printed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> known as "Dialogus", the work of Tullio Crispoldi (Rome, 1539). At <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, moreover, he gathered around him a group of learned men to assist him in his efforts at reform. His complete works were edited by the famous scholars <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Pietro and Girolamo Ballerini</a> ("Constitutiones Gibertinae", "Costituzioni per le Monache", "Monitiones generales", "Edicta Selecta", "Lettere Scelte", etc., <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, 1733, 1740), together with an appendix containing the story of his life, a "Dissertatio de restitut&acirc; ante concilium Tridentinum per Jo. Matth. Giberti ecclesiastic&acirc; disciplina", and two panegyrics, one in Latin by Fumani, the other in Italian by <a href="../cathen/03409c.htm">Castiglione</a>.
