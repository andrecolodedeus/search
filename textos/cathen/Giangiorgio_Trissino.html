<h1>Giangiorgio Trissino</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> poet and scholar, b. of a patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> in 1478; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 December, 1550. He had the advantages of a good <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> training, studying Greek under the noted Demetrius Chalcondylas at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and philosophy under Nicol&ograve; Leoniceno at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. His culture recommended him to the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, who in 1515 sent him to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as his <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>; later on <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> showed him especial favour, and employed him as ambassador. In 1532 the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> made him a count palatine. In spite of the banishment from <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> pronounced upon him in 1509 because his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had favoured the plans of Maximilian, he was held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Wherever he abode his home was a centre for gatherings of scholars, <em>litt&eacute;rateurs</em>, and the most cultured men of the time. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life was far from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, apparently through little fault of his own. In the history of modern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> literature Trissino occupies a prominent place because of his tragedy "Sofonisba" (1515; recent ed., Bologna, 1884), the first tragedy in Italian to show deference to the classic rules. Constantly a partisan of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> regularity, he disapproved of the genial freedom of the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> epic as written by <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto</a>. In his own composition the "Italia liberata dai Goti" (1547-8), dealing with the campaigns of Belisarius in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he sought to show that it was possible to write in the vernacular an epic in accordance with the classic <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. The result is a cold and colourless composition.

<p>He was one of the many who engaged in the discussion as to what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> literary Italian. Following the lead of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, he espoused in his "Castellano" (1529) the indefensible theory that the language is a courtly one made up of contributions from the refined centres in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, instead of being, as it is, fundamentally of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> origin. For clearness he proposed that in writing Italian certain new characters (derived from the Greek alphabet) are adopted to show the difference between open and close <em>e</em> and <em>o</em> and voiced and voiceless <em>s</em> and <em>z</em>. This wise proposition was ignored. "I Simillimi" (1548) which is a version of the "Men&aelig;chmi" of Plautus, "I Ritratti" (1524) which is a composite portrait of feminine beauty, and the "Poetica", which contains his summing up of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> principles of literary composition, made up the rest of his important writings. An edition of his collected works was published by <a href="../cathen/16058b.htm">Maffei</a> at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> in 1729.
