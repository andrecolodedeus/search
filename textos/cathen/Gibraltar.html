<h1>Gibraltar</h1>  

<p>VICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF GIBRALTAR.

<p>Gibraltar is a rugged promontory in the province of Andalusia, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, about 6 miles in circumference. Its almost perpendicular walls rise to a height of 1396 feet. The town in on the west side; on the north a narrow isthmus (neutral ground) connects the fortress with the mainland of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The great rock itself is the ancient Mount Calpe, which with Abyla (Ceuta) constituted the famous Pillars of Hercules. In antiquity Gibraltar belonged in turn to the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a>, Carthaginians, Romans, and <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>. Scipio took it from the Carthaginians, and it remained Roman territory until A.D. 412, when the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> became masters of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Being <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, they built two churches of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the vicinity of Calpe; one at San Rocco, the other, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, on the rock itself. In 710 the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> kingdom in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, after an existence of 300 years, was torn with internal strife. Amid this dissension the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> crossed from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, for the second time (711), under their leader Tarik-Ibn-Zeyad, who sent a detachment of soldiers to Mount Calpe, and had a castle built there, the ruins of which yet excite admiration. The mountain was thenceforth known as Gibel-Tarik, the mountain of Tarik, or Gibraltar. Thus began the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> conquest of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Gibraltar was besieged, in 1309, and retaken from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> by Alonzo de Guzman. By 1462 it had sustained eight sieges, with varying fortune. The last of these was under Alonzo de Arcos, who captured it from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in 1462, the surrender on this occasion taking place on 20 August, the feast of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, in consequence of which he became the patron of Gibraltar. The Infante Don Alonzo gave the city and territory of Gibraltar to the Duke of Medina-Sidonia in absolute and perpetual possession for himself and his successors. Ferdinand and Isabella confirmed this gift, conferring on the Duke of Medina-Sedonia the title of Marquis of Gibraltar; at a later period, however, during the same reign, the place was annexed by the Crown.

<p>During the War of Spanish Succession, which began in 1701, Gibraltar was besieged (1704) by a squadron commanded by Sir George Rooke and a land force of 1800 English and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt; after three days the city was captured (24 July). The fortress had 100 cannon and ammunition, but a garrison of only 150 men; the inhabitants were reduced to 6000. After a bombardment of six hours the garrison surrendered.

<p>Before a year had passed <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> endeavoured, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to recapture Gibraltar. In this, the twelfth siege of Gibraltar, the attacking party had a great preponderance of numbers, but the fortress successfully resisted all their efforts to capture it. By a special <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of February, 1706, Queen Anne declared Gibraltar a free port. In 1713, by the Treaty of Utrecht, it became definitively a British possession, though many attempts were made by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> to regain it. The last siege, the fourteenth in its history, began 14 July, 1779, and continued for 3 years, 7 months, and 12 days. In April, 1782, the French and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> again bombarded Gibraltar by land and sea, but without success. A peace was finally concluded by which <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> received the island of <a href="../cathen/10332a.htm">Minorca</a> in place of Gibraltar. When the city was occupied by the English in 1704, the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> carried away whatever they could and settled in the neighbouring district of San Rocco. Scarcely a dozen <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> remained in Gibraltar. It was subsequently populated by people of every nation, especially by <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> and Maltese, as is evident from the various <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> names. Spanish is generally spoken by the people, though English is the tongue of public administration.

<p>The population (1908) numbers about 25,000, of whom 16,000 to 18,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and the rest <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, etc. The garrison varies in number from 3,000 to 5,000 men. Gibraltar is ruled by special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; has a military governor, an admiral, and a colonial secretary. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gibraltar does not reside there. Until 1806 Gibraltar belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">See of Cadiz</a>. In that year it was made a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> (since 1840 the vicar is always a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> number 11 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 5 religious. There are 8 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men and 4 for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with a total of 28 and 61 members respectively. There is but one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, though three of the churches have each a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is provided for by 6 boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (1136) under the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Brothers of St. John of God</a>, and 8 girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (1126). There is also an institute for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of boys (141) and two similar ones for girls (174). There are many other private institutions and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the most important of which is the Rook Academy under the direction of M. Sitman. The poor are cared for in 3 asylums, and there are 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> (65); for the aged, also, there is a house of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>. Guido Remigio Barbieri, a former <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, born in 1836, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14577c.htm">Theodosiopolis</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Gibraltar in 1901.
