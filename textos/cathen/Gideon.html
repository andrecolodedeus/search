<h1>Gideon</h1>  

<p>Gideon or Gedeon (Hebrew "hewer"), also called JEROBAAL (<a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#vrs32">Judges 6:32</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#vrs1">7:1</a>; etc.), and JERUBESHETH (<a href="../bible/2sa011.htm#vrs21">2 Samuel 11:21</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew text</a>).

<p>Gideon was one of the Greater Judges of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. He belonged to the tribe of Manasses, and to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Abiezer (<a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#vrs34">Judges 6:34</a>). Gideon's father was Joas, and lived in Ephra (<a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#vrs11">Judges 6:11</a>).

<p>The following is in substance the account of Gideon's judgeship as related in Judges, vi-viii: <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, having forsaken <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> worship, had been for seven years exceedingly humbled by the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a> and of other Eastern tribes. At length, they turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who sent them a deliverer in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Gideon. In a first theophany, granted him by day while he was threshing wheat, Gideon received the difficult mission of freeing his people; whereupon he built an altar to the Lord (<a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#vrs24">Judges 6:24</a>). In a second theophany during the following night, he was directed to destroy the village-altar to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and to erect one to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>. This he did with the result that the people clamoured for his death to avenge his insult to their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> god. Joas, however, saved his son's life by the witty taunt, which secured for the latter the name of Jerobaal: "Let <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> revenge himself!" (vi, 25-32). Thus divinely commissioned, Gideon naturally took the lead against <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalec</a>, and other Eastern tribes who had crossed the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, and encamped in the valley of Jezrael. Comforted by the famous signs of the fleece (vi, 36-40), and accompanied by warriors from Manasses, <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a>, <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephthali</a>, he took up his position not far from the enemy. But it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> intervention to show that it was His power which delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and hence He reduced Gideon's army from 32,000 to 300 (vii, 1-8). According to a divine direction, the Hebrew commander paid a night visit to the enemy's camp and overheard the telling of a dream which prompted him to act at once, certain of victory (vii, 9-15). He then supplied his men with trumpets and with torches enclosed in jars, which, after his example, they broke, crying out: "The sword of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> and Gideon." Panic-stricken at the sudden attack, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> enemies turned their arms against one another, and broke up in flight towards the fords of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> (vii, 16-23). But, summoned by Gideon, the Ephraimites cut off the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a> at the fords, and captured and slew two of their princes, Oreb and Zeb, whose heads they sent to the Hebrew leader, rebuking him at the same time for not having called earlier upon their assistance. Gideon appeased them by an Eastern proverb, and pursued the enemy beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> river (vii, 24; viii, 3). Passing by Soccoth and Phanuel, he met with their refusal of provisions for his fainting soldiers, and threatened both places with vengeance on his return (viii, 4-9). At length, he overtook and defeated the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, captured their kings, Zebee and Salmana, returned in triumph, punishing the men of Soccoth and Phanuel on his way, and finally <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> Zebee and Salmana (viii, 10-21). Grateful for this glorious deliverance, Gideon's countrymen offered him the dignity of an hereditary king, which he declined with these noble words: "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, but <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> shall rule over you" (viii, 22-23). He nevertheless asked and obtained from his soldiers the golden rings and other ornaments which they had taken from the enemy; and out of this spoil he made what seems to have soon become an object of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Gideon's peaceful judgeship lasted forty years. He had seventy sons, and "died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in Ephra" (viii, 24-32). His victory is alluded to in <a href="../bible/isa010.htm#vrs26">Isaiah 10:26</a>, and in <a href="../bible/psa082.htm#vrs12">Psalm 82:12</a>, where the four kings mentioned in Judges, vii, viii, are distinctly named- a fact which shows that, at the time when this psalm was composed, the narrative of Gideon's exploits was commonly known in its present form. The various literary features exhibited by the text of Judges, vi-viii, have been minutely examined and differently appreciated by recent scholars. Several commentators look upon these features- such for instance as the two names, Gideon and Jerobaal; the two theophanies bearing on Gideon's call; the apparently twofold narrative of Gideon's pursuit of the routed enemies, etc.- as proving conclusively the composite origin of the sacred record of Gideon's judgeship. Others, on the contrary, see their way to reconcile all such features of the text with the literary unity of Judges, vi-viii. However this may be, one thing remains perfectly sure, to wit, that whatever may be the documents which have been utilized in framing the narrative of Gideon's exploits, they agree substantially in their description of the words and deeds of this Greater Judge of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.
