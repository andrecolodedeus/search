<h1>Gift of Miracles</h1>  

<p>The gift of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is one of those mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in his <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs9">First Epistle to the Corinthians (12:9-10)</a>, among the extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the Holy Ghost. These have to be distinguished from the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost enumerated by the Prophet Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs2">11:2 sq.</a>) and from the fruits of the Spirit given by St. Paul in his <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs22">Epistle to the Galatians (5:22)</a>. The seven gifts and the twelve fruits of the Holy Ghost are always infused with <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just. They belong to ordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and are within the reach of every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The gifts mentioned in the Epistle to the Corinthians are not necessarily connected with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life. They are special and extraordinary powers vouchsafed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only to a few, and primarily for the spiritual good of others rather than of the recipient. In Greek they are called <em>charismata</em>, which name has been adopted by Latin authors- they are also designated in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> technical language as <em>gratiae gratis datae</em> (graces gratuitously given) to distinguish them from <em>gratiae gratum facientes</em>, which means <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> or any <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> granted for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the recipient.

<p>The gift of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as one of these <em>charismata</em>, was expressly promised by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His disciples (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs12">John 14:12</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17-18</a>), and St. Paul mentions it as abiding in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. "To another [is given] the grace of healing . . . To another, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> "- (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). Christ imparts this gift to chosen servants as He did to the Apostles and disciples, that His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> may become credible and that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may be confirmed in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> has declared in chapter iii "De Fide". This gift is not given to any created being as a permanent habit or quality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The power of effecting <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> works such as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Divine Omnipotence</a>, which cannot be communicated to either men or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The greatest thaumaturgus that ever appeared in this world could not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> at will, neither had he any permanent gift of the kind abiding in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The Apostles once asked concerning a cure of demoniacal possession: "Why could we not cast him out? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> replied, this kind is not cast out but by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs18">Matthew 17:18 sqq.</a>). Eliseus could not raise to life the son of the Sunamitess with his staff.

<p>The grace of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is therefore only a transient gift by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> moves a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to do something which issues in a wonderful work. Sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes use instrumentally of contact with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or visits to sacred shrines for this purpose. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> work is always the effect of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Omnipotence</a>, nevertheless, men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may be said to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in a threefold way <ul><li>by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> invoking a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> effect; <li>by disposing or accommodating the materials, as it is said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that they will in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> collect the dust of the dead bodies that these may be re-animated by the Divine power, <li>by performing some other act in co-operation with the Divine agency, as in the case of the application of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, or of visits to holy places which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has marked out for special and extraordinary favours of this kind. </ul>To Christ even as man, or to His humanity, was granted a perpetual and constant power of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. He was able of His <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> to work them as often as He judged it expedient For this He had the ever-ready concurrence of His Divinity, although there was in His Humanity no permanent quality which could be the physical cause of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> tells us sufficient with regard to <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in their relation to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life when explaining their estimate in the cause of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification and canonization</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He says: It is the common opinion of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that the grace of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> is a grace <em>gratis data</em>, and therefore that it is given, not only to the just but also to sinners (though only rarely). Christ says that He knows not those who have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though they may have prophesied in His name, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">cast out devils</a> in His name, and done many wonderful works. And the Apostle said that without charity he was nothing, though he might have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to remove mountains. On this passage of the Apostle, <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">Estius</a> remarks: <blockquote> For as it offers no contradiction to the Apostle that a man should have the gift of tongues or prophecy, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of mysteries, and excel in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which are first spoken of; or be liberal to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or give his body to be burned for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which are afterwards spoken of and yet not have charity, so also there is no contradiction in a man having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to remove mountains, and being without charity (Treatise on Heroic Virtue, III, 130). </blockquote>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> manifest themselves in two ways. One way as dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, teaching and sanctifying her, as, for example, when even a sinner in whom the Holy Ghost does not abide works <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to show that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which he preaches is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Hence the Apostle writes: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs4">Hebrews 2:4</a>). In another way, the manifestation is made by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the Holy Ghost as belonging to him who performs the works. Hence in Acts it is said that St. Stephen, full of grace and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, did great wonders and signs among the people (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs8">Acts 6:8</a>). Here we have a distinction clearly drawn out as to the manner in which <em>gratiae gratis datae</em> may be to the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receiving them as well as to the utility of others, and how it is that by these <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> without <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> may perform signs and wonders for the good of others. But these are rare and exceptional cases and real <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> can never be performed by a sinner in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his own personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> or in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because that would be a deception and derogatory to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who alone can perform <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.
