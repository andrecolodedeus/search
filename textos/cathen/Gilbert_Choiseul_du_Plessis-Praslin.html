<h1>Gilbert Choiseul du Plessis-Praslin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. 1613; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 31 December, 1689. He was a descendant of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of du Plessis. He devoted himself from his earliest youth to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, while his brother C&aelig;sar entered the military career. Both attained distinction. Gilbert received the title of Doctor at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> in 1640, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges in 1644, and at once set about visiting his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, restoring discipline among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and establishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges. In time of famine he pawned his own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to assist the poor; and during the plague until stricken by the disease he ministered in person to the sick. In 1671 he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Diocese of Tournai</a>, where he displayed the same pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.

<p>His influence on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at large was less successful. When, in 1651, the majority of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> to decide upon the ten propositions of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, Choiseul was among the eleven who requested the Holy Father by special letter to issue no decision in the case. Unable to prevent a formal condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, he exerted himself to bring about an agreement between the contending parties. These efforts had no other result than to reveal in the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a regrettable leniency towards a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so disastrous to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His standing towards Gallicanism was clearer. For his bold and constant advocacy of the "Gallican Liberties" he was chosen, in the <a href="../cathen/01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> of 1682, member of the committee on resolutions, and was personally entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of formulating in Latin the propositions on which the Assembly was to vote. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> had in 1673 extended to his entire kingdom the royal right of <em>r&eacute;gale</em>. Two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only protested against the usurpation and appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This was the beginning of a stubborn struggle between <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> and <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. To obtain public approval and support from his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to have limits set to the pontifical power, the king, at the instance principally of his minister, <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert</a>, convoked the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in a general assembly. Choiseul had no sooner presented his draft than <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> rose against it. An animated discussion, related in full by <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> in his "De Summi Pontificis Auctoritate", ensued. When Choiseul saw that <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> conciliatory distinction between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See's</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> in teaching the Faith and its indefectibility in holding it found favour with both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and Court, he resigned his special commission. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> took his place and drew up the four articles as they passed into history.

<p>Choiseul's leaning towards <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> betrayed him into another <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> step. He approved the French translation of a little book published in Cologne under the title "Monita salutaria Beat&aelig; Mari&aelig; Virginis ad cultores suos discretos". This book was justly reproved by so many that Choiseul thought it well to publish, in a pastoral letter on the Blessed Virgin, a justification of himself. Fortunately the attitude of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> towards Gallicanism and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> did not affect his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He published (Paris, 1681-85) his "M&eacute;moires touchant la Religion", against <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>, libertines, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. His "Psalms and Hymns of the Church", done into French, ran through several editions. He also arranged and gave the literary finish to the interesting memoirs of his brother, the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal Choiseul du Plessis.
