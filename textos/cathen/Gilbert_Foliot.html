<h1>Gilbert Foliot</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, b. early in the twelfth century of an Anglo-Norman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and connected with the earls of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1186. He became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Cluny in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he rose to the rank of prior; then he was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> at Abbeville, and later at Gloucester. He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> in 1147. As <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he took an important part in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and national affairs, was a supporter of Empress Matilda and a confidential adviser of Theobald, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. In 1163 he was transferred to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, though such a translation was very exceptional at the time; but he received the support of Becket and the special consent of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. Foliot was a man of learning and eloquence and a good administrator. The austerity of his life was almost too widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. However, in the great struggle for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the church between Henry II and <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> he definitely took the king's side. In the stormy scenes at Clarendon and Northampton and during the prolonged negotiations of the years of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas's</a> exile, his name is foremost among the opponents of his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; and he was one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who, by their remonstrances against a renewed <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in 1170, brought about indirectly St. Thomas's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. It may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Gilbert was opposed to Becket's <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and methods more than to his aims, but Henry II would have been more than a match for a diplomatic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A king who combined to such an extent intelligence and passion could have been checked only by a wave of popular enthusiasm. (See <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">SAINT THOMAS BECKET</a>).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Gilbert Foliot's name appears on nearly every page of the Becket controversy and reference must be made to the bibliography of St. Thomas.<br>The treatment of Foliots character is particularly full in LHUILLIER, St Thomas de Canterbery, 2 vols.
