<h1>Gilbert G&eacute;nebrard</h1>  

<p>A learned <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> and <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>, b. 12 December, 1535, at Riom, in the department of Puy-de-D&ocirc;me; d. 16 Feb., 1597, at Semur, department of C&ocirc;te-d'Or. In his early youth he entered the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mausac near Riom, later continued his studies at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint-Allyre in <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and completed them at the College de Navarre in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he obtained the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in 1562. A year later he was appointed professor of Hebrew and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> at the Coll&egrave;ge Royal and at the same time held the office of prior at <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">Saint-Denis</a> de La Chartre in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was one of the most learned professors at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and through his numerous and erudite <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works became famous throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Among his scholars at the Coll&egrave;ge Royal was <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, who in his later life considered it an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to have had G&eacute;nebrard as professor (Traite de l'Amour de Dieu, XI, 11). About 1578 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he was honourably received by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> and stood in close relation to Allen, <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Bosio, and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> celebrities. Upon his return, in 1588, he became one of the chief supporters of the Holy League in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On 10 May, 1591 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, but accepted this dignity only after the express command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/02374b.htm">Archbishop Beaton</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a> on 10 April, 1592. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he remained a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> leaguer, even after Henry IV became reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in July, 1593. The new king, however, became daily more popular and gained over to his side most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. G&eacute;nebrard saw that further opposition would be useless and, on 15 Nov., 1593, sent his submission to the king ("Revue des questions historiques", Paris, 1866, I 616, note). This, however, did not prevent the Provencal Parliament from banishing him on 26 Sept. 1596. For a short time he stayed at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, but being allowed by the king to return, he retired to the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Semur, which he held <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>. G&eacute;nebrard translated many rabbinic writings into Latin, wrote one of the best commentaries on the Psalms: "Psalmi Davidis vulgat&acirc; editione, calendario hebraeo, syro, graeco, latino, hymnis, argumentis, et commentariis, etc. instructi" (Paris, 1577); is the author of "De Sanct&acirc; Trinitate" (Paris, 1569); "Joel Propheta cum chald&aelig;&acirc; paraphrasi et commentariis", etc. (Paris, 1563); "Chronographiae libri IV" (Paris 1580), and numerous other works. He also edited the works of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Paris, 1574).
