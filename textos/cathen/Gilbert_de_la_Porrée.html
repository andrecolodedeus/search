<h1>Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e</h1>  

<p>(Gilbertus Porretanus)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and general scholar; b. at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> in 1076; d. in 1154; studied under Hilary in <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, under Bernard of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> at the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there, and finally under <a href="../cathen/01550b.htm">Anselm</a> at Laon, where he probably first met <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Peter Abelard</a>. Returning later to <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the arts there for about fifteen years, receiving a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> and holding at intervals the office of chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> (1141), at which <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> was censured. The following year we find him teaching in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, with <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> among his pupils; but only for a brief space, for in 1142 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>. His high character for learning and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> seems to have won for him the universal respect and veneration of his contemporaries. But his teaching regarding the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> involved him in trouble for a time. Two of his own <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, alarmed at its novelty, reported it to <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, and induced <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> to oppose Gilbert's doctrines in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> presence at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1147) and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1148). The dispute ended amicably without any very definite issue. Gilbert died universally regretted in the year 1154.

<p>He lived and taught during the critical epoch when the great scholastic synthesis, both in and in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was just beginning to take shape. The principles, methods, and doctrines of purely rational research were being extended from philosophy to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and applied &mdash; often rashly, as with <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> &mdash; to the elucidation of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> philosophy was finding its way through <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> and Jewish channels into the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, gradually to supplant <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> influences there, and the discussion of the great central problem of the validity of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> &mdash; the controversy on the <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a>, as it was then called &mdash; was waxing warm and vehement. Gilbert's place among his contemporaries was a leading and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> one; while his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writings secured for him a fame that long survived him. In his "Liber Sex Principiorum" he explained the last six categories of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, the latter having treated expressly only the first four. The work immediately took its place as a scholastic textbook, side by side with the "Isagoge" and the "Categories", and was studied and expounded for three centuries in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. His "Commentary on the Four Books of Boethius", especially on the two "De Trinitate", contain those applications of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a> which for a time brought his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> under suspicion.

<p>Gilbert's attitude on the controverted question of the <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a> has been very variously interpreted: as ontological realism (Prantl), empiric realism (Clerval, Zigliara), moderate realism ill-defined (de Wulf, Turner). The latter is, perhaps, nearest to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Gilbert's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, like that of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, is an attempt, though only partially successful, to repudiate the extreme realism of the epoch, with its <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> tendencies. The universal concept (of the <em>genus</em> or class) has corresponding to it in the world of sense a number of similar singular objects. This similarity is, however, explained by Gilbert in away that brings it quite near identity. The created essence (<em>forma nativa, eidos</em>) of the individual member of a class is a copy of the Divine exemplar, "singularis in singularibus, sed in omnibus universalis" (<a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, Metal., II, xvii). He means that the <em>forma nativa</em> is not really (numerically) one and the same <em>in omnibus</em>, but only conceptually, i.e. by the consideration of the mind; so much is fairly evident from another reference of his to "universalia . . . quae ab ipsis individuis humana ratio quodammodo abstrahit" (P.L., LXIV, 1374). Yet there are grounds for supposing that he attributed to the <em>forma nativa</em>, as it is in the individual, the universality of the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> concept. In the actual individual he distinguishes between the common or class essence which he calls <em>subsistentia</em>, e.g. "humanity" or "human nature" in the abstract, and that which makes it an existing individual and which he calls <em>substantia</em> e.g. "Plato". This process of objectifying and dividing off the abstract from the concrete, in the individual, he carried so far as to allege that in it "universality" was a distinct <em>subsistentia</em>, different from "singularity", and that the "unity" of the individual was a <em>subsistentia</em> distinct from the individual which it made "one". He thus mistook <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> distinctions for real; and he carried his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His Divinity, the Father and His Paternity, the Son and His Sonship, the Holy Ghost and His Procession, the Divine Persons and the Divine Nature, he saw a distinction which is really due to our human way of grasping reality as a concrete embodying an abstract, a singular containing a universal, an essence determined by an existence but which Gilbert, with his <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonizing</a> tendency to model the ontological upon the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, conceived to be due to a division and plurality in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> Itself. This was an excessive reaction against the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> which would submerge all the real distinctions of things in an identity with one indivisible Divine existence.

<p>Gilbert's "Liber Sex Principiorum" and his "Commentary on <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>" are in P.L., CLXXXIV and LXIV. He also left numerous commentaries on various books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> work called "Liberde Causis", sometimes attributed to him, is in reality an abridged Latin translation, through the Arabic, of the "Elevatio Theologica" of Proclus, a Greek Neo-Platonist of the fifth century.
