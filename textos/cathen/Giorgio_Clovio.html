<h1>Giorgio Clovio</h1>  

<p>(Also known as <em>Giulio Clovio</em>)

<p>A famous Italian miniaturist, called by <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> "the unique" and "little <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>", b. at Grizani, on the coast of <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>, in 1498; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1578. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> appear to have come from <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and his original name was perhaps Glovic. Coming to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the age of eighteen, he soon won renown, and became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cardinal Grimani, for whom he engraved medals and seals. One of his first pictures was a Madonna after an engraving by Albert <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer</a>. In 1524 Clovio was at Buda, at the court of King Louis II, for whom he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the "Judgment of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>" and "Lucretia". In 1526 he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and a year later, falling into the hands of the Constable Bourbon's banditti, he made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to enter religion if he could escape from them. He accordingly took orders at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and illustrated several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, adopting in religion the name Giulio, perhaps in memory of <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>, who had been one of his early advisers. Thanks to the intervention of Cardinal Grimani, he was soon released from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and spent several years in the service of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, for whom he executed some of his most beautiful works &mdash; a Latin <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a>, 1537 (in Lord Hertford's collection), and a <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> (in the Trivulzio Library at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>). He was at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1538, but in 1540 was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>. Cosimo II then lured him to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and princes disputed over his achievements. Philip II ordered from Clovio a life of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, in twelve scenes, and John III of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> paid him 2000 ducats for a psalter, but a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book which he made for <a href="../cathen/05788b.htm">Cardinal Farnese</a>, and which <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> calls a "divine work", was considered Clovio's masterpiece. The binding was made after a design by Cellini. Clovio died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the age of eighty; his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is to be seen in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, and his works are preserved in all the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially that of the Vatican.

<p>This famous artist, although one of the most highly esteemed in his own line, was nevertheless among those who helped to injure it. By introducing into it the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and monumental style of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and replacing rich costumes, delicate arabesques, and gothic foliage by the nude, by antique ornaments, trophies, medallions, festoons, etc., Clovio contributed largely to the decadence of the charming art of miniature-painting, and his example of extreme elaboration was imitated throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at a time when printing had not yet supplanted <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for editions de luxe. However sumptuous his work, it lacked the quality which distinguished that done by the French illuminators at an earlier period for <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and the Duc de Berry.
