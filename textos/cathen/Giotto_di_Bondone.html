<h1>Giotto di Bondone</h1>  

<p>A Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and founder of the Italian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, b. most probably, in 1266 (not 1276), in the village of Vespignano near <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in the valley of the Mugello; d. at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 8 Jan., 1337.

<p>Very little is known of his early history. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> relates that <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a>, rambling one day in the neighborhood of Colle, saw a young shepherd lad drawing one of his sheep on a piece of smooth slate with a pointed stone, and that <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> thereupon took the lad with him and instructed him. The story is a pretty bit of fancy. There is no reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that Giotto was ever a shepherd. It is possible that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was a peasant; if so, he was in easy circumstances and certainly a freeholder. A document <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1320 styles him <em>vir pr&aelig;clarus;</em> such an epithet would not be applied to a man in straitened circumstances. As a matter of fact nothing is known of Giotto until he was thirty years old. This unfortunate gap in his personal history robs us of a story which would be of intense interest as showing the growth of his genius, and reduces us to the merest conjectures. However, without in any way detracting from Giotto's pre-eminence in Italian art, it is impossible to accord him that quasi-miraculous, providential importance that Florentine nationalism soon raised to a kind of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> in the history of art. According to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> he arose in a barbarous age and straightway revealed a fully developed art to a wondering world. This is not credible. The thirteenth century, the century of the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and of the French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of carving whose numerous pupils were met with in all parts of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, cannot be called a barbarous age. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> itself a widespread renaissance was taking place. At <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the admirable <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <em>marmorarii</em> of which the Cosmati are the most illustrious, recalled to life much antique beauty of form. The mosaic-workers, with Jacopo Torriti and the artists who created the marvels of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">Baptistery</a> of Florence, likewise the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, with Pietro Cavallini whose fresco cycles in Santa Maria in Trastevere (Rome) exhibit all Giotto's breadth of form, are satisfactory <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of an earlier renewal of artistic spirit and power. The "Rucellai Madonna" by <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a> dates from 1285. Twenty years earlier, perhaps the very year of Giotto's birth, <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicol&ograve; Pisano</a> had completed the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">Baptistery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. That of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> followed in 1272. The lovely fountain at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> dates from 1278. Then came the works of Giovanni Pisano, whose sympathetic genius is in more than one way akin to that of Giotto. Amid this rich and wondrous development of art the young master grew up. Though he was by no means its creator, it certainly reached in him its highest expression.

<p>As an artist Giotto is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son of St. Francis. It is at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> that he is first found, in that very basilica which was the cradle of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and which still enshrines the most perfect records of its early history. There every master of note in the peninsula might have been seen at work. Giunta of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> was decorating the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a>, while Cavallini or one of his pupils was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> scenes from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in the upper church. <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> was at the same time ornamenting the choir and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>. It was doubtless in the train (<em>brigata</em>) of <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> that Giotto came to Assisi in 1294, and that he became acquainted with the works of the <em>marmorarii</em>, whose style so influenced his own. In 1296 <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whereupon Giovanni da Muro, General of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (1296-1304), entrusted to Giotto the execution of the wonderful story of St. Francis which the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> accomplished in the famous twenty-eight scenes of the upper church. This is at once the source of Giotto's glory and the earliest example of the Italian School. In these scenes Giotto followed <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure's</a> life of St. Francis officially approved by the chapter of 1263 as the only official text. The first twenty-one frescoes are entirely by Giotto's hand; the remaining seven were finished from his designs by his pupils. All have suffered greatly from the humidity and from restorations. They are, nevertheless, incomparable monuments of art, and in many ways the very greatest for the history of modern <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The intense impression created by St. Francis, the historical nearness of his truly evangelical <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, and his likeness to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> borne out by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm"><em>stigmata</em></a>, thenceforth influenced art to an incalculable degree. For the first time in centuries <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, until then limited to the repetition of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> themes, to an unvarying reproduction of hieratic patterns, were free to improvise and create. Painting was no longer an echo of tradition, but rose at once to all the dignity of invention. In the portrayal of the wonderful life-story of St. Francis, to his own age a real image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, current events and the everyday life of the period were seized on and appropriated. Art no longer worked on conventional models, abstract and ideal; its models were to be the realities of nature, which the humblest intelligence is capable of appreciating. Representation of real life was to become the object of all <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. Henceforth there must always be a likeness between the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and the object <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> portrait of St. Francis had to be given to the public, which must see his actions and the place where he lived, must also grasp all local peculiarities of topography, people, dress, and architecture. This principle of actuality and reality underlay the artistic revolution initiated by Giotto. Since the days of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> nothing so important had occurred in the history of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>.



<p>The germ of all this was to be found in the very earliest portrait of St. Francis, e.g. that of the "Sagro Speco" at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> and in those of the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a> at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> degli Angeli, where the figure of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is inset between two rows of small panel-pictures descriptive of events in his life. To enlarge these vignettes into frescoes and thereby tell the story of Francis in heroic outlines was equivalent to equating the power of artistic expression and the new vastness of the pictorial framework; this prompted, in consequence, a background overflowing, so to speak, with contemporary life. This much Giotto undertook to do, and his success was marvellous. One is astounded at the multitude of things he suddenly brings within the domain of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. Such an invasion of realism is not met with again till the seventeenth century, when <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> gives us its counterpart in his life of Marie de' Medici. All <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> is there; cities and their environs, the walls of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, the temple of Minerva and the church of San Damiano at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the Lateran, the graceful interior of the Greccio church, the landscapes of Alvernia and Subasio, rural scenes like St. Francis's sermon to the birds, domestic interiors as in the "Death of the Lord of Celano", scenes from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, e.g. chapter meetings and choir services. Every type of existence is laid under tribute: <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, peasants, townfolk, burghers, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, singers by the roadside, men at drink, at feasts, and funerals. No peculiarity of place, condition, costume, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, escapes the far-sweeping eye of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. He has put into his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> every phase of life, and it is all so genuine and accurate, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to reality that in his work, after five centuries, the Italian <em>trecento</em> still lives for us, despite the deplorable state of the frescoes, the defects of his perspective, and the childlike archaism of certain technical formul&aelig;. No <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> has ever surpassed Giotto in his power of gathering details from real life, and of surrounding the commonplace with an artistic halo. Herein also lies the power of all literary creators of life, from <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in his "Divina Commedia" to Balzac in the "Com&eacute;die Humaine". The genius of Giotto was brought into further prominence by the works he executed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he was called in 1298 by Cardinal Stefaneschi. It may be noted at once that the "Navicella", i.e. the famous <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> that adorns the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of St. Peter's, was done in collaboration with Cavallini; moreover, the original has long since disappeared beneath successive restorations. A fourteenth-century copy may be seen in the Spanish Chapel at Florence.

<p>The frescoes from the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which Giotto executed for St. Peter's, were destroyed in the time of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, when the choir of the old St. Peter's was being remodelled. His Roman masterpieces, however, were the three frescoes ordered by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> for the loggia or balcony of the Lateran to commemorate the famous jubilee of 1300. They represented the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Constantine, the erection of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, and the proclamation of the jubilee. The first and second have perished, and only a fragment of the third remains, inset in the eighteenth century in one of the great pillars of the basilica, where it is yet visible. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> stands between two <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, in the act of giving his blessing. The loss of this fresco is somewhat compensated for the by a seventeenth-century sketch (in the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>) which restores the ensemble of the original scene. It was a magnificent representation of an actual spectacle, a vast historical panorama of which the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> must have been an eyewitness, an immense portrait gallery showing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the army, and the Roman people; all this on the occasion of a momentous event in the history of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.

<p>From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Giotto returned to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, perhaps in 1301, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the "Last Judgment" in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Podest. This fresco is in a way a political manifesto, being a kind of idealized grouping of all classes of Florentine <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, somewhat after the manner of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> great poem. Therein can be recognized <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> himself, Brunetto Latini, Corso Donati, Cardinal d'Acquasparta, and Charles of Valois. The "Life of Mary Magdalen", which completed the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> decorations, is now so faded and discoloured as to be beyond recognition. In 1306, Giotto was called to Padua to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the Capella dell' Arena, built by Enrico Scrovegni in expiation of the crimes of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurer</a> Reginaldo. On the lateral walls the artist treated in thirty-six frescoes scenes from the life of Christ and of the Blessed Virgin. Beneath these scenes he placed fourteen small cameo figures, allegories of the vices and virtues; on the end wall above the scene of the Annunciation, he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a "Last Judgment". With this work a new epoch opens in the career of Giotto. It is the first of those vast complete series, or great decorative poems, conceived by him with systematic thoroughness, and meant to develop fully a single great <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. It is truly a living organism, at once once pictorial and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, such as is met with later in the Spanish Chapel, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and in the Camera della Segnatura. This introduction of allegory, on an elevated and magnificent scale, is his new master-concept. His work is henceforth dominated by an attempt to to bring out the moral meaning and by unity of purpose. The historical element, of course, still held the place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; it had not varied for centuries, had been the same since the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and Santa Maria Maggiore at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Giotto, indeed, continued to use the earlier conceptions, but could not fail to imbue with his own wonderful realism the traditional treatment of these sacred scenes. There is, perhaps, no pictorial type more striking than Giotto's <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> in the scene of the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. Circumstances here forced the artist's genius into a new path. Since his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> had not in these sacred scenes the freest play, he turned to the perfection of artistic style: consequently the Padua frescoes are a new phase in his realization of the beautiful. In the mind of Giotto life now appears conditioned by art. This preoccupation with the artistic presentation of things is striking at Padua from the earlier scenes, those depicting the story of St. Joachim and the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, where there are charming pastorals rarely equalled, such as "Joachim among the shepherds", the "Meeting at the Golden Gate". One scene in particular, the marriage cort&egrave;ge of the Blessed Virgin, is introduced merely that the artist may develop a beautiful plastic theme, a frieze of white-veiled girls, quite like the procession of Greek maidens in the Panathen&aelig;an festivals. <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a> mentions other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> made by Giotto for the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at Padua. However, the most perfect examples of the master's maturer skill are his frescoes at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, between 1310 and 1320, in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a> of the famous basilica of St, Francis. He began in the right <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> with the addition of two <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> as a kind of appendix or supplement to the "Life" which he had <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> twenty years earlier in the upper church. Facing these he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> nine frescoes of the Holy Childhood, a replica of the Padua frescoes but superior for delicacy and charm. In his quality of historian Giotto never rose above this work, the most exquisite of all his narrative frescoes. His crowning work, however, in this period, was the decoration of the roof-groining over the altar. In it he sets forth the "Triumph of St. Francis", together with the triumphs of the virtues which were the foundation of the order: poverty, chastity, obedience. This is the earliest example of those <em>trionfi</em> which from the Campo Santo at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> to <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a> and <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> are a favourite theme of Italian art. It is moreover the earliest masterpiece of monumental art. The earlier "Psychomachia" of the poet Prudentius, so often treated by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> and outlined by Giotto himself in the aforesaid tiny allegories of the Capella dell' Arena, takes on here a larger development. We seem to hear, as it were, an orchestration of incomparably greater variety and significance. The intimate meaning of life and thought, the power of plastic art, and the genius of beautiful symbols; the majesty of harmonious order, the beauty of the types, personifications and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; the wondrous blending of fact and fancy; the perfect preservation of the original colours, all combine to make this magnificently planned ensemble one of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> works of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. It seems to breathe the puissant moral <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, while one of its lovely figures, the well-known Lady Poverty, suggests from afar all the mystic and quaintly modern poetry of <a href="../cathen/02708b.htm">Botticelli's</a> "Primavera".

<p>The closing years of Giotto's life (1320-27) were spent at Florence. His work at this period in the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> del Carmine and the palace of the Podest, where he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> an allegory of Good Government (a theme of <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Ambrogio Lorenzetti</a> at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> in 1337), has almost entirely perished. Of all his work in the Bardi and <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Peruzzi</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church of Santa Croce there survive but some remnants. The Bardi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> contains in six scenes a new life of St. Francis, besides four figures of the greater <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>, St. Elizabeth, St. Louis IX, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09385c.htm">St. Louis of Toulouse</a>. (<a href="../cathen/09385c.htm">St. Louis of Toulouse</a> was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1317; the decoration of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> must, therefore, be of later date.) The <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Peruzzi</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> contains six scenes from the lives of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>. These frescoes were whitewashed over in the eighteenth century, were discovered in 1840, and have suffered much in the course of restoration. In this final evolution of his art, Giotto, now a master and sure of his own powers, seems to lean towards the abstract in the treatment of his subjects. He appears to subordinate all to the rhythm of the composition. An almost excessive desire for balance and symmetry gives to these later works an aspect of stiffness, somewhat the impression of <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>. They seem somewhat cold and academic. And yet they reveal incomparable beauty and figures of genuine sculpturesque perfection. In the "Resurrection of St. Paul" the group of the Disciples leaning over the empty sepulchre, though two centuries earlier than <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, is almost the same as the group of young geometricians in the latter's "School of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>".

<p>There is no evidence that Giotto ever visited <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, or any of the other places where frescoes are attributed to him. King Robert of Anjou induced him to visit <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1330, and he remained there three years, but left no trace of his influence on the local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. As for the pretended journey to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and his death there, it is well known to be a fiction. <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone di Martino</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> author of the admirable frescoes in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In his later years Giotto, recognized as chief among Italian artists, was more or less <em>capomaestro</em> or Master of the Works for all public constructions in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. We are told that he aided in designing the Porta San Giovanni of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">Baptistery</a>, the work of <a href="../cathen/01470a.htm">Andrea Pisano</a> (1330). It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he drew the plans for the Campanile in 1334. Perhaps the designs for the fifty-eight <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> by Andrea are partly his, recalling as they do in more than one particular the "Virtues and Vices" at Padua. There are very few of Giotto's panels, properly so-called. One large "Madonna di Maest" in the Accademia at Florence is interesting when compared with that of <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>. A triptych of the "Life of St. Peter" <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1298 for Cardinal Stefaneschi is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of the canons at St. Peter's. Finally, his "St. Francis receiving the Stigmata", at the Louvre, is a youthful r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the noble frescoes at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>.

<p>No <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> ever made such an impression on his age as Giotto. All fourteenth-century art betrays his influence. No <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was ever so numerous nor so homogeneous as the <em>Giotteschi</em>. <a href="../cathen/06332b.htm">Taddeo and Agnolo Gaddi</a>, <a href="../cathen/11275b.htm">Orcagna</a>, Spinello, and others, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, are weak imitators of their master. Indeed, outside of Florence there is no originality save at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> where <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone di Martino</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Lorenzetti</a> worked, and later at Padua in the days of Jacopo Avanzo and Altichieri. The triumph of Giotto, and the thorough manner in which his successors imitated him, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> how fully he embodied the national genius. In <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> he invented that <em>dolce stil nuovo</em>, that <em>vulgare eloquium</em> which <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> created in the realm of poetry. He is truly the founder of the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>He was not handsome, says <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, who was his friend, as was also <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, whose portrait he so often <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>. Nor must it be imagined that this great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of St. Francis was either a mystic or an ascetic. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> life too well for that. He has left us in a canzone, mediocre enough as poetry, a satire on "Holy Poverty" and the excesses of the "Fraticelli", the radicals among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of that time. Moreover, the Florentine novelists, <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccaccio</a> and Sacchetti, tell many anecdotes of him in which he figures as a bon-vivant, jovial, good-natured, with a sense of humour and a pardonable eccentricity. He may have been wealthy, as he worked diligently and charged good prices for his work. He married Cinta di Lapo del Pela by whom he had eight children. The eldest, Francesco, registered in 1341 as a member of the guild of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> at Florence.
