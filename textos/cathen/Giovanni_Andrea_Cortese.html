<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Giovanni Andrea Cortese</h1>  

<p>(His name in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> was Gregorio).

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and monastic reformer, b. 1483 at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>; d. 21 Sept., 1548. After receiving a training in the Humanities at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> under the learned <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Varino of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, he devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> for five years, first at Bologna, then at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and was graduated as doctor of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> at the early age of seventeen. His thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Latin and Greek languages induced Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, the future <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>, to take him into his service and afterwards appoint him legal auditor in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. Desirous of leading a more quiet life, Cortese resigned this office and in 1507 entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Polirone near <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, one of the most flourishing <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the recently founded Cassinese Congregation. When Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici heard that his former auditor had become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he addressed a letter to him expressing his surprise and his displeasure at the step which Cortese had taken and urging him to leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and resume his former occupation in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In his answer to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> letter Cortese points out the great dangers which beset his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when he was still engaged in worldly pursuits, and speaks of the interior <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which he experienced while chanting the Divine praises and applying himself to the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. When in 1513 Giovanni de' Medici ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, Cortese sent him a letter of congratulation in which, however, he did not omit to remind the new pontiff of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to begin at last that general reform of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stood in extreme need. Like many other saintly and learned men of the time, Cortese was deeply grieved at the indifference manifested by many ecclesiastical dignitaries towards a wholesome internal reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is due to his untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> reform, which had recently been inaugurated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the Cassinese Congregation, was carried through, and that, with the return of monastic discipline, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> again became seats of that learning for which they had been so famous in the past.

<p>In 1516 Augustin de Grimaldi, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grasse and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a>, united his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the Cassinese Congregation, and, upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> request, Cortese and a few others were sent thither to assist in introducing the Cassinese reform. Here Cortese devoted himself to literary pursuits, and in order to promote the study of the Humanities he founded an academy where he and other learned members of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> the French youth, thus becoming instrumental in transplanting to French soil the literary Humanistic movement. The moral and literary reform of L&eacute;rins was assured when in 1524 Cortese was elected its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. His health, however, was greatly impaired during his sojourn at <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a>, so that in 1527 he considered a change of climate indispensable and asked the superior of the congregation for permission to return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. As a result, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>; a year later, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>; and in 1537 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the famous San Giorgio Maggiore at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Cortese was now considered one of the most learned men in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and had regular correspondence with the greatest scholars in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He counted among his friends <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Gasparo Contarini</a>, <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a>, <a href="../cathen/13324a.htm">Jacopo Sadoleto</a>, <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Pietro Bembo</a>, Gian Matteo Giberti, and many other Humanists and ecclesiastical dignitaries. The garden of San Giorgio was the place where these <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned discussions were held to which the Florentine scholar Brucciolo refers in his dialogues on moral philosophy. In 1536 <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> made him a member of the committee of nine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who were to draw up a statement of those <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses which called most loudly for reform. Soon after, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15483a.htm">Apostolic visitor</a> for the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and, somewhat later, was sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to take part in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputation at Worms in 1540, but became sick on the journey and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remain in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Meanwhile (1538) he became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of San Benedetto in Polirone, then the most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Cassinese Congregation. A few times, moreover, he was chosen visitor general of his congregation. Finally, 2 June, 1542, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> and appointed him a member of the committee of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> for the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Towards the end of the same year he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. During the five years of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> he was an esteemed friend and adviser of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and used all his influence to bring about that reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for which the better sort of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> had been clamouring many years.

<p>Cortese was one of the best-known writers of his times. He was master of such a finished style that the classically trained <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Cardinal Bembo</a> and others did not hesitate to class him among the most elegant Latin writers of this Humanistic period. His principal works are epistles, poems, a treatise proving that St. Peter was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a Latin translation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> from the Greek texts, a historical work on the destruction of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, etc. All his extant works were collected and edited with a biography of the author by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Bishop Gradenigo of <a href="../cathen/03519b.htm">Ceneda</a> in two volumes (Padua, 1774).
