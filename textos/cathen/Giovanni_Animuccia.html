<h1>Giovanni Animuccia</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> composer, born at Florence about 1500; died 1571. He was a pupil of Claude Goudimel. He was made choir-master at the <a href="../cathen/14029b.htm">Vatican</a> and retained this position until his death. He was the real predecessor of <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> not only in office, but also in his earnest endeavours to attain harmonic clearness in the midst of all the devices of <a href="../cathen/04436a.htm">counterpoint</a> then so much in vogue. He aimed at perfecting the style of the old <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> by harmonic fullness, by a more natural melodic progression of the voices, and a closer correspondence of the melody with the text. His friendship with <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> resulted in his appointment as music-master to the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint</a>. He composed the first <em>laudi</em> for its use. These <em>laudi</em> were songs of praise for several voices, and were always performed after the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a>. For the sake of variety, Animuccia composed single stanzas and later on single lines in the shape of solos, concluding with a powerful and effective chorus. A first volume of them appeared in 1566, a second in 1570. These <em>laudi</em> proved to be the germs of the later <em>oratorio</em>, for from their dramatic tone and tendency the <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a> seems to have been developed. In this sense <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> has been called the "Father of the Oratorio". In addition, Animuccia composed many masses, <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a>, psalms, and madrigals of which some were published in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1548-68. But his compositions which were never printed are far more numerous, and the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of them today are, for the most part, in the Sistine Chapel

<p>Paolo Animuccia, brother of Giovanni, died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1563. He was choir-master at the Lateran for two years (1550-52). He left little printed music. There is a <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motet</a> of his in a collection published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1568), and madrigals of his composition are found in many of the miscellaneous collections published between 1551 and 1611.
