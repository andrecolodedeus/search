<h1>Giovanni Battista Caprara</h1>  

<p>Statesman and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born at Bologna, 29 May, 1733; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 27 July, 1810. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Count Francesco Raimondo Montecuccoli and Countess Maria Vittoria Caprara; it was from his mother that he took his name. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, he was appointed in 1758 vice-legate of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, in 1767 <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1775 at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, and in 1785 at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, In this last and most important position he did not always defend with sufficient <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the aggressions of the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> (1765-90), and the imperial <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Prince Kaunitz</a> and Count Cobenzl. During the summer of 1792 he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of Sant' Onofrio, and in August, 1800, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08372a.htm">Jesi</a> in the Mark of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. When the Concordat between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (1800-23) and the French Republic was concluded (July, 1801), <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, then First Consul, asked for the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> with residence in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His choice fell upon Cardinal Caprara, undoubtedly because he expected in this way little or no opposition to his plans; Caprara was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in August, 1801; he departed at once for his destination and arrived in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on the 4th of October. During the negotiations which followed concerning the execution of the Concordat he displayed too conciliatory a spirit in dealing with the ten constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were to be appointed to as many of the newly-established <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; in fact, he went contrary to specific instructions from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. However, persistent pressure exerted by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> may be taken as an excuse for the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> conduct. Cardinal Caprara officiated at the Solemn restoration of public worship in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Notre-Dame on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> (18 April, 1802), at which function the First Consul, the high officers of state, and the new ecclesiastical dignitaries assisted. At times the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> showed more strength in the interest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; thus, in a letter written 18 August, 1803, he protested most energetically against the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a> added to the Concordat by the French Government.

<p>In May, 1802, Shortly after the above-mentioned solemnities, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and as such he blessed, on the 26th of May, 1805, the Iron Crown, which <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> placed on his own head in his new dignity of King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Otherwise Caprara retained his position as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> until his death, or rather until the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> in July, 1809. His declining health saved him from the embarrassment connected with the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and second marriage of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> (April, 1810). In his last will his entire fortune was left to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. In memory of all that was done in behalf of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he published the "Concordat et recueil des bulles et brefs de N. S. Pie VII. sur les affaires de l'Eglisede France" (Paris, 1802). Cardinal Caprara was a man of simple and pure habits, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for religion and very charitable, but often inclined to yield to the imperious will of princes and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, a weakness which at times justified the reproaches of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1775-99) and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>.
