<h1>Giovanni Battista Castello</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, and architect; b. at Gandino, in the Valle Seriana, in the territory of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, in 1509 (some writers state 1500 or 1506); d. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1579. He is commonly called Il Bergamasco, to distinguish him from Giovanni Battista Castello, a <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, who was a miniature-painter. When young, he was entrusted to the care of Qurelio Busso of <a href="../cathen/04481b.htm">Crema</a>, a pupil of <a href="../cathen/03155a.htm">Polidoro da Caravaggio</a>, by whom he was taught the first principles of art. That <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> took him to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and after some time left him in that city, unprotected and without means, but considerably advanced in his studies. A <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> nobleman, Tobia Pallavicino, took him under his protection and sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study the great masters there, where he became very proficient in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, and architecture. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> he decorated the palace of his protector and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> some frescoes in the church of San Marcellino. He made a great reputation by his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Sebastion, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Sebastiano and, together with Luca Cambiasco, was employed by the Duke Grimaldi, in the Nunziata di Portoria in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, Castello <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> on the ceiling of the choir the Savior as judge of the World, and Luca <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> the laterals with the fate of the Blessed and the Reprobate. On visiting his native country, desiring to leave there something worthy of his fame, he undertook his great work in the hall of the <a href="../cathen/08793c.htm">Lanzi</a> Palace at Gorlago, where he has represented some of the most interesting subjects of the Iliad.

<p>Towards the latter part of his life (1567) he was invited by <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II</a> to visit <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and was employed by that monarch in the palace of the Pardo, which he ornamented with subjects from Ovid. He also executed some works in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> and other palaces, and died holding the office of architect of the royal palace. As architect, he is supposed to have remodelled the church of San Matteo in Genoas and to have designed the imperial palace at Campetto. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of Castello show correct design, with excellent colouring, more nearly allied, however, to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> than to the Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.
