<h1>Giovanni Battista Rinuccini</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1592; d. at <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, 1653; was the son of a Florentine patrician, his mother being a sister of Cardinal Ottavo. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">Universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">Bologna</a>, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, in due course he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, having at the age of twenty-two obtained his doctor's degree from the <a href="../cathen/12112a.htm">University of Pisa</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he won distinction as an advocate in the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>, and in 1625 became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>. For the twenty years following, his life was the uneventful one of a hard-working chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and then, in 1645, he was sent as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Maddened by oppression, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had taken up arms, had set up a legislative assembly with an executive government, and had bound themselves by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> not to cease fighting until they had secured undisturbed possession of their lands and religious liberty. But the difficulties were great. The Anglo-Irish and old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> disagreed, their generals were incompetent or quarrelled with each other, supplies were hard to get, and the Marquis of Ormond managed to sow dissension among the members of the Supreme Council at Kilkenny. In these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> sought for foreign aid from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and the latter sent them Rinuccini with a good supply of arms, ammunition, and money. He arrived in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in the end of 1645, after having narrowly escaped capture at sea by an English vessel. Acting on his instructions from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he encouraged the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> not to strive for national independence, but rather to aid the king against the revolted <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>, provided there was a repeal of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> in existence. Finding, however, that Ormond, acting for the king, would grant no <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Rinuccini wished to fight both the Royalists and the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>. The Anglo-Irish, satisfied with even the barest toleration, desired negotiations with Ormond and peace at any price, while the Old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> were for continuing the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> until the Plantation of Ulster was undone, and complete toleration secured. Failing to effect a union between such discordant elements, Rinuccini lost <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; and when Ormond surrendered Dublin to the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> became utterly helpless from dissension, he left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1649, and retired to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where he died.
