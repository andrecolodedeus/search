<h1>Giovanni Contarini</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> School, born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> about 1549; died in 1605. Contarini was a contemporary of Jacopo Palma called Palma Giovine. He was a great student of the works of <a href="../cathen/14737a.htm">Tintoretto</a> and <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> and is declared to have been an exact imitator of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>. According to an old story he was so extremely accurate in his portraits that on "sending home one he had taken of Marco Dolce his dogs began to fawn upon it mistaking it for their master". Contarini's work is extremely mannered, soft and sweet, but distinguished by beautiful, rich colouring and executed very much on the lines of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian's</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. His finest picture is in the Louvre, having been removed from the ducal palace at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and represents the Virgin and Child with St. Mark and St. Sebastian, and the Doge of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Marino Grimani, kneeling before them. Other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of his are in the galleries at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and in many of the churches at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> easel-pictures of mythological subjects, which are treated with propriety and discretion but are peculiarly lacking in force and strength; in many of the palaces in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> he decorated ceilings. Some years of his life were passed at the court of the Emperor Rudolf II, with whom he was a great favourite and by whom he was <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knighted</a>. His work has been described by one writer as a "combination of sugar, cream, mulberry juice, sunbeam and velvet", but the criticism is a little <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and one or two of his works, for example the "Resurrection" in the church of San Francesco di Paolo at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, can claim to be masterly. This picture is certainly a fine piece of colouring, well composed and well carried out.
