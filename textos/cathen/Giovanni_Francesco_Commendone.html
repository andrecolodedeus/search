<h1>Giovanni Francesco Commendone</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Papal Nuncio</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 17 March, 1523; died at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, 26 Dec., 1584 After receiving a thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the humanities and in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1550. The ambassador of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> presented him to <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Pope Julius III</a>, who was so favourably impressed by the unusual learning of the youthful scholar that he appointed him one of his secretaries. After successfully performing various <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> missions of minor importance, he accompanied <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Legate</a> Dandino to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Pope Julius III</a> sent him in 1553 on an important mission to <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary Tudor</a>, who had just succeeded Edward VI on the English throne. He was to treat with the new queen concerning the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Accompanied by Penning, a servant and confidant of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Reginald Pole</a>, Commendone arrived in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> on 8 Aug., 1553. Though <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary Tudor</a> was a loyal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, she was surrounded at court by numerous opponents of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, who made it extremely difficult for Commendone to obtain a secret interview with her. By chance he met John Lee, a relation of the Duke of Norfolk and an attendant at court, with whom he had become acquainted in Italy, and Lee succeeded in arranging the interview. Mary received Commendone kindly, and expressed her desire to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and to acknowledge the spiritual authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but considered it prudent to act slowly on account of her powerful opponents, Commendone hastened to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, arriving there on 11 September, and informed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the joyful news, at the same time handing him a personal letter from the queen. Commendone continued to hold the office of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary under <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, who esteemed him very highly and in return for his services appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15750a.htm">Zante</a> in 1555. In the summer of 1556 he accompanied <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Legate</a> Scipione Rebiba on a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> mission to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, to the courts of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> and King Philip II, the consort of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary of England</a>. Commendone had received instructions to remain as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at the court of Philip, but he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> soon after his arrival in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. On 16 September of the same year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent him as extraordinary <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the Governments of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> in order to obtain help against the Spanish troops who were occupying the Campagna and threatening <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>In 1560, when <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> determined to reopen the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Commendone was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to invite the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Estates to the council. He arrived in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> on 3 Jan., 1561, and after consulting with Emperor Ferdinand, set out on 14 January for Naumburg, where the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Estates were holding a religious convention. He was accompanied by Delfino, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09191a.htm">Lesina</a>, who had been sent as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to Ferdinand four months previously and was still at the imperial court. Having arrived at Naumburg on 28 January, they were admitted to the convention on 5 February and urged upon the assembled <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Estates the necessity of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> representation at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in order to restore religious union, but all their efforts were of no avail. From Naumburg, Commendone traveled northward to invite the Estates of Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He went by way of Leipzig and Magdeburg to <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, where he arrived on 19 February and was well received by Joachim of M&uuml;nsterberg, the Elector of Brandenburg. Joachim spoke respectfully of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and expressed his desire for a religious reconciliation, but did not promise to appear at the council. Here Commendone met also the son of Joachim, the young Archbishop Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, who promised to appear at the council but did not keep his word. Leaving Berlin, Commendone visited Beeskow, Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, Iburg, <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Cleves, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and Aachen, inviting all the Estates he met in these places. From Aachen he turned to Lubeck with the intention of crossing the sea to invite Kings <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Erie XIV of Sweden. The King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, however, refused to receive the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, while the King of Sweden invited him to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, whither he had planned to go in the near future. Queen Elizabeth of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had forbidden the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> Hieronimo Martinengo to cross the English Channel when he was sent to invite the queen to the council, hence it was very improbable that she would allow Commendone to come to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He therefore repaired to <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, awaiting further instructions from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Being recalled by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in Dec., 1561, by way of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and Western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Although his mission was without any results as regards <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> representation at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, still his spotless character and his strong and unselfish pleas for a return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity made a deep impression upon many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Estates. The numerous letters which Commendone wrote during this mission to <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> present a sad but faithful picture of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during those times. These and others were published in "Miscellanea di Storia Italiana" (Turin, 1869, VI, 1-240).

<p>In Jan., 1563, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> sent Commendone to Emperor Ferdinand at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, to treat with him regarding some demands which he had made upon the council in his "Libel of <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>". In October of the same year <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to King Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> with instruction to induce this ruler to give political recognition to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees. Yielding to the requests of Commendone and of <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Hosius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, Sigismund not only enforced the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms, but also allowed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, to enter <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. While still in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, on the recommendation of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, Commendone was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on 12 March, 1565. He remained in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> until the death of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (9 Dec., 1565), and before returning to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he went as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. to the Diet of Augsburg, which was opened by Maximilian II on 23 March, 1566. He had previously warned the emperor under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> not to discuss religion at the diet. He also seized the opportunity to exhort the assembled Estates to carry into execution the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees. In Sept., 1568. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> sent him a second time as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Maximilian II. In muon with Biglia, the resident <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, he was to induce the emperor to make no new religious concessions to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Estates of Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and to recall several concessions which he had already made. While engaged in this mission, Commendone was also empowered by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 Oct., 1568, to make an apostolic visitation of the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the adjacent provinces. An account of this visitation in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> and Salzburg in the year 1569 is published in "Studien und Mittheilungen aus dem Benedictiner und Cistercienser Orden" (Br&uuml;nn, 1893, XIV, 385-398 and 567-589). In Nov., 1571, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the emperor and to King Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in the interest of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. After the death of King Sigismund, in 1572, he promoted the election of Henry, Duke of Anjou, as King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, thereby incurring the displeasure of the emperor. Upon his return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1573, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> appointed him a member of the newly founded <em>Congregatio Germanica</em>, the purpose of which was to safeguard <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He was so highly esteemed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> that, when <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> fell dangerously ill, it was generally believed that Commendone would be elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but he was outlived by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a>.
