<h1>Giovanni da Bologna</h1>  

<p>Flemish <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, about 1524; d. at Florence in 1608. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> gives little information about this eminent <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>. He calls him "a youth of great talent and of spirit" and says he was one of the competitors with Cellini for the colossal figure of Neptune in his chariot drawn by sea horses. The duke, who was to decide the competition, although assured that Giovanni's model was superior to the others, did not confide the undertaking to him. We can judge of what he would have made of that commission from the bronze Neptune prepared for the fountain at Bologna.

<p>Giovanni was called Il Fiammingo from the place of his birth. He studied in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and settled in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, having been adopted by the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> Bernardo Vecchietti, who treated him as his son. He was thoroughly Florentine in sentiment, and in Florence are preserved his two masterpieces, "Mercury" and the "Rape of the Sabines". In the former, in the Bargello, he has come nearer to expressing swift, flashing motion and airy lightness than has any other <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artist</a> of that or a later period. The figure of the youth with winged feet, holding the caduceus, and borne aloft upon a head of &AElig;olus, is masterly in its expression of earnest purpose and light, easy movement. Hardly less important is the "Rape of the Sabines" in marble under the Loggia dei <a href="../cathen/08793c.htm">Lanzi</a>, in which Count Ginori posed for the figure of the triumphant youth who carries away a struggling <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the embrace. Other works are the group of "Hercules and Nessus", the equestrian bronze figure of "Duke Cosimo I" in the Piazza Signoria and the <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> of the doorway of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. Besides these, he executed more than one crucifix, a figure of "Diana", another of "Venus", and four syrens similar to the larger ones on the Bologna fountain. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> mentions a bronze figure of "Bacchus" and a "Samson" in combat with two <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, both larger than life size. Giovanni's work is marked by freedom and grace, while free from the fault of exaggeration which so injures much of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of the very late <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>.
