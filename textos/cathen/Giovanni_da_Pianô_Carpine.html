<h1>Giovanni da Pian&ocirc; Carpine</h1>  

<p>Born at Pian di Carpine (now called della Magione), near <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, Umbria, 1182; died probably in 1252. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> he was a companion of C&aelig;sar of Spires, the leader of the second mission of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1221. He took a leading part in founding various new establishments of the order, and was several times provincial in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and once in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1245 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, in compliance with the resolutions passed at the first council of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, entrusted Carpine with an embassy to the princes and people of <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a> or Tatary with a view to checking the invasions of these formidable hordes and eventually effecting their conversion. Carpine set out early in 1246; among his companions were Brothers Stephen of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Benedict of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who were to act as interpreters. They were hospitably entertained by Duke Vasilico in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, where they read the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters to the assembled <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, leaving them favourably disposed towards reunion. They reached Kanieff, a town on the Tatar frontier, early in February. The Tatar officials referred them to Corenza, commander of the advance guards, who in his turn directed them to Batu, Khan of Kipchak etc., then encamped on the banks of the Volga. Batu commissioned two soldiers to escort the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys to Kar&acirc;korum, the residence of the Great Khan. They reached their destination in the middle of July after a journey of indescribable hardships. The death of the Great Khan Okkodai made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to defer negotiations till the end of August when Kuyuk, his successor, ascended the throne. After much delay Kuyuk finally demanded a written statement of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> propositions. His letter in reply is still preserved. Its tone is dignified and not unfriendly, but independent and arrogant. In it he says in substance: "If you desire peace, come before me! We see no reason why we should embrace the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. We have chastised the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian nations</a> because they disobeyed the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Jenghiz Khan. The power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is manifestly with us." The superscription reads; "Kuyuk, by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Khan and Emperor of all men &mdash; to the Great Pope!" Carpine procured a translation of the letter in Arabic and Latin. On their homeward journey the envoys halted at the former stations, arriving at Kieff (Russia) in June, 1247. They were enthusiastically received everywhere, especially by the Dukes Visilico and Daniel, his brother, Carpine's proposals for reunion had been accepted in the meantime, and special envoys were to accompany him to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court. From a political and religious aspect the mission to Tatary proved successful only in a remote sense, but the ambassadors brought with them invaluable information regarding the countries and peoples of the Far East. Carpine's written account, the first of its kind and remarkable for its accuracy, was exhaustively drawn upon by such writers as Cant&ugrave; and <a href="../cathen/07510a.htm">Huc</a> ("Travels in Tatary, Thibet and China", 2 vols., 1852). It has been published by d'Azevac: "Jean de Plan de Carpin, Relation des Mongols ou Tartares" in "Recueil de voyages", IV (Paris, 1839), and later by K&uuml;lb: "Geschichte der Missionsreisen nach der Mongolei", I (Ratisbon, 1860), 1-129. <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a>, who met Carpine in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, found him "a pleasant man, of lively wit, eloquent, well-instructed, and skilful in many things". <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> bestowed upon him every mark of esteem and affection. Having been sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Carpine was shortly afterwards named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>.
