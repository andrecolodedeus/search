<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Giraldus Cambrensis</h1>  

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald de Barry) was a distinguished writer, historian, and ecclesiastic of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; b. in Manorbeer, Pembrokeshire, about the year 1147; d. probably between the years 1216 and 1220. His father, William de Barry, was one of the most powerful of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> nobility at the time. Though Gerald's brothers adopted the profession of arms he himself followed a more peaceful course, devoted himself to study, and, influenced by his uncle, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. David's, resolved to become an <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastic</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to continue his studies; and, if we are to believe his own account, he was looked upon here as a model of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. He returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> about 1172, and was employed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, where he distinguished himself for his efforts to remove the abuses then flourishing in the <a href="../cathen/15582b.htm">Welsh Church</a>. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Brecknock. On the death of his uncle, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. David's (1176), the chapter fixed upon Giraldus as the man most likely to withstand the aggressions of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and submitted his name to Henry II. The king promptly rejected him in favour of one of his Norman retainers; the chapter acquiesced in the decision; and Giraldus, disappointed with the result, withdrew to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and here continued his studies. In 1180 he returned to <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and received an appointment from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. David's, which he soon resigned, and was sent by Henry II to accompany Prince John on his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> expedition (1184). While in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he composed his work "Topographia Hibernica", which purports to give a description of the country, but is full of legends and tales, as well as the "Expugnatio Hibernica". The latter work is not entirely unreliable, but requires to be read with care. He left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1186, and two years later accompanied Archbishop Baldwin in his journeys through <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, preaching the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. Here, according to his own account ("Itinerarium Cambri"), his eloquence met with such a response that <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> was denuded of its fighting men. He went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but was recalled to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1190, where he informs us he was offered the Bishopric of Bangor and, in 1191, that of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>.

<p>On the death of Peter de Leia, 1198, the chapter of St. David's again nominated Giraldus for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; but Hubert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, refused confirmation. Representatives of the canons followed Richard to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but before they could interview him he died; his successor, King John, received them kindly, and granted them permission to hold an election. They were unanimous in their selection of Giraldus; and, as Hubert still refused to confirm the election, Giraldus started for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had an interview with <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, however, had anticipated him, and, as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not convinced that St. David's was independent of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, the mission of Giraldus <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a failure. It was in connexion with this that he wrote his book "De jure Menevensis Ecclesi&acirc;". Giraldus returned, and was supported by the chieftains of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, while King John warmly espoused the cause of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. After a long struggle the chapter of St. David's deserted Giraldus, and having been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to escape secretly from <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> he fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> annulled both elections, and Geoffrey Henlaw was appointed to the See of St. David's, despite the strenuous exertions of Giraldus, who afterwards reconciled with the king, and received from him a small pension. At the next election in St. David's, 1214, his name was passed over in silence. He was alive after 1216, as it is evident from the way in which he speaks of John that that king was already dead.

<p>De Barry was a writer of remarkable brilliancy and force, a narrator rather than a historian, full of self-confidence, and at times <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and on the whole neither the model of perfection which he proclaims himself to be, nor the despicable character which he is oftentimes <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>. His works are published in the Rolls Series; and in the prefaces to the volumes indications as to probable dates of composition and publication. Appended is a list of de Barry's writings: "Topographia Hibernica"; "Expugnatio Hibernica"; "Itinerarium Cambri&aelig;"; "Gemma Ecclesiastica"; De Instructione Principum"; "De Rebus a se gestis"; "Vita S. Davidis II episcopi Menevensis" (which Brewer considers as, more probably, the work of Giraldus); "Descriptio Cambri&aelig;" (published as the last); "Vita Galfridi Arch. Eboracensis"; "Symbolum Electorum"; "Invectionum Libellus"; "Speculum Ecclesi&aelig;"; "Vita S. Remigli"; "Vita S. Hugonis"; "Vita S. Davidis archiepiscopi Menevensis"; "Vita S. Ethelberti"; "Epistola ad Stephanum Langton"; "De Giraldo Archidiacono Menevensi"; "De Libris a se scriptis"; "Catalogus brevior librorum"; "Retractationes"; "De jure Menevensis Ecclesi&aelig;". See introduction to his works by the editors, Brewer and Dimock.

<p>The works of Giraldus dealing especially with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>: the "Topography", and "History of the Conquest", though long regarded as possessing considerable authority, did not escape hostile criticism. In "Cambrensis Eversus" (1662), under the pseudonym of Gratianus Lucius, Dr. Lynch, of whose personal history little is known, produced a work which, though controversial in character, entitles the author to repute rather as a painstaking chronicler than as a controversialist of a high order. After criticizing the "Topography" adversely, and showing that the title of the second book, the "Conquest of Ireland", is a misnomer, the writer of "Cambrensis Eversus" disproves de Barry's title of historian, and meets his charges against the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> people. Giraldus is impeached with <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the language, and unfamiliarity with the country; he is said to have embodied in his works unauthenticated narratives, with little regard for <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>; his own admission that he had "followed the popular rumours of the land" is extended in meaning, and perhaps unduly insisted upon.

<p>Nor is the "Cambrensis Eversus" merely a collection of arbitrary accusations and unsubstantial rejoinders, made with a view to effect the discredit of de Barry as a writer of history. What might be urged as the greatest imperfection of Lynch's polemic, its too great wealth of detail, had not escaped the attention of the able author, who excuses the diffuseness to which he is compelled by asseverating his determination to follow Giraldus closely to the end. Whatever may be said as to the ability with which Lynch discharged his task of controversialist, there can be no denial of the thoroughness and, above all, the sincerity of his methods. He does not pick out the weak points in his opponent's armour, and never shirks the issue; but grapples with every difficulty, as the order of his opponent suggests.

<p>Perhaps the most serious accusation levelled against Giraldus, next to the indictment of bias and dishonesty, is that wherein he is impeached of being addicted to the cult of the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and the practice of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>. If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and Merlin would seem to have exercised a considerable sway over the mind of de Barry, then it would be vain to seek in the writings of the latter the reflex of that calm discrimination and sober balance of judgment which should characterize the historian. Finally, it may be said that the student of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> history, by reading the works of Giraldus in the light of "Cambrensis Eversus", cannot fail to derive a helpful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the period which they embrace.
