<h1>Girolamo Casanata</h1>  

<p>(Or Casanatta)

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 13 July, 1620; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 March, 1700. His father, Tommaso Casanatta, was a member of the supreme council of the kingdom. Girolamo studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of his native town and practised in the courts for some time. Eventually he gave up the brilliant promises of a secular career and entered the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in deference to the advice of Cardinal Pamphily whom he had met on a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When that <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, Casanata was made private chamberlain and soon advanced rapidly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, becoming in turn Governor of Sabina, <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Fabriano</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>. In the last-named city he became a close friend of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Emilio Altieri, afterwards <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>. In 1658 <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> sent him as inquisitor to <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, whence he was shortly recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and made <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the "Consulta" and active member of the courts known as the "Segnatura di Grazia" and the "Segnatura di Giustizia". He was Consultor of the Congregation of Rites and of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and governor of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> that chose the successor of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>; under <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> he was made assessor of the Holy Office (Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>). He was appointed secretary of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, and 13 June, 1673, was named <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of the Title of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Porticu, and later (1686) <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of San Silvestro in Capite. In 1693 <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> bestowed on him the office of Librarian of the Vatican (Bibliotecario di Santa Romana Chiesa). On his death-bed he was assisted by two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Father Cloch&eacute;, the general of the order, and Father Massouli&eacute;. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. John Lateran, though his heart was deposited in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the church of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, to whom he was always warmly attached, and who looked on him as their benefactor. The many responsible offices held by Casanata are evidence of his uncommon wisdom and his extensive curial experience. In the conduct of these offices it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he study profoundly the numerous and grave <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, disciplinary, and political questions brought before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the latter half of the seventeenth century. It will suffice to recall the controversies concerning <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a> (Michael Molinos, <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, Madame Guyon), the Gallican Liberties, the right of <em>R&eacute;gale,</em> the Four Articles of 1682, the Chinese Rites controversy between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and other orders, not to speak of various <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the time, not unlike our own in its extravagant <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> fancies, and the diffusion of lax moral theories so frequently condemned by contemporary <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>.

<p>The Casanatense Library (see below) still preserves 1125 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> volumes of opinions, reports, and statements (<em>voti, relazioni, posizioni</em>) concerning matters treated in the various Congregations to which Casanata belonged. So far these precious materials have been too little utilized to justify a satisfactory account of the part he played in contemporary <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. His curial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> did not prevent him from taking an interest in letters and the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. He was on friendly terms and corresponded with the learned men of his day. Among those whom he encouraged most was Zaccagni, whom he induced to publish the well-known collection of materials for the ancient history of the Greek and Latin Churches, "Collectanea monumentorum veterum Ecclesi&aelig; gr&aelig;c&aelig; et latin&aelig;" (Rome, 1694, 4to). His chief service to learning, especially the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, was the Casanatense Library (Biblioteca Casanetense) founded and endowed by him. While living he had collected a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of about 25,000 volumes; this he left to the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, together with an endowment fund of 80,000 <em>scudi</em> (almost as many dollars), to provide for the administration of the trust and for the acquisition of new books. In 1655 the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> had inherited the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Giambattista Castellani, chief physician of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, with 12,000 <em>scudi</em> for the erection of a suitable edifice. Cardinal Casanata, moreover, ordered that the new <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> should be accessible to the public six hours daily, excepting feast-days. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> staff he provided for a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> (<em>theologi casanatenses</em>) of six <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of different nationalities (Italian, French, Spanish, German, English, Polish). Each of them must previously have received the degree of Doctor from one of the most famous <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Aided by the resources of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, they were to devote themselves to the defence and propagation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. Moreover, two professors were to expound regularly the text of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> ("Summa Theologica" and other writings). In other words, by means of the new <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, he had created at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> another centre of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity (see "Minerva", 1892-93, II, 622). After the loss of the temporal power (1870) the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was declared national <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were left in charge until 1884. At present the Casanatense Library is entirely under lay management. It has 5238 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, among them 64 Greek <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> (15 of them the gift of Casanata), and 230 Hebrew texts (rolls and books), among which are 5 <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>. The <em>incunabula</em> (books printed before 1500) number 2036; there is also a large collection of Roman governmental proclamations (<em>bandi, editti</em>) from 1500 to 1870, comedies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, etc. Father Cloch&eacute;, the General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, placed in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Cardinal Casanata, the work of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Le Gros. An inscription records the formal permission of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> to preserve there the books of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> authors.
