<h1>Giuliano Cesarini</h1>  

<p>(Also known as CARDINAL JULIAN)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1398; died at Varna, in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> 10 November, 1444. He was one of the group of brilliant <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> created by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> on the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, and is described by <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> as the strongest bulwark that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could oppose to the Greeks in the council of Florence. He was of good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, where he studied <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> with such success as to be appointed lecturer there, <a href="../cathen/03312b.htm">Domenico Capranica</a> and <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a> being among his pupils. When the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was ended by the universal recognition of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Giuliano returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he attached himself to Cardinal Branda. Suggestions of wide reform were rife, and the principles of the outward <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and its reformation from within became the ideals of his life. In 1419 he accompanied Branda on his difficult mission to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> were in open rebellion. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> thought so highly of his services that he used to say that, if the whole Church were to fall into ruin, Giuliano would be equal to the task of rebuilding it. He had all the gifts of a great ruler, commanding <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers, and great personal charm. He was a profound scholar and a devoted Humanist, while his private life was marked by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and austerity. In 1426 <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and sent him to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to preach a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the reformers who were committing grievous excesses there. After the failure of this appeal to arms Cesarini was made President of the Council of Basle in which capacity he successfully resisted the efforts of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> to dissolve the council, though later (1437) he withdrew from the opposition, when he perceived that they were more anxious to humiliate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> than to accomplish reforms. When the reunited council assembled at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> he was made head of the commission appointed to confer with the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> and succeeded at least in winning their confidence. In 1439, owing to a plague, the council was transferred from <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where Cesarini continued to play a prominent part in the negotiations with the Greeks. After the successful issue of the council, Cesarini was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1443) to promote a national <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. He was opposed to the peace with Ladislaus, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and signed at Szegedin with Sultan Amurath III, and persuaded the former to break it and renew the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. It was an unfortunate step and resulted in the disastrous defeat of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army at Varna in 1444, when Cardinal Giuliano was slain in the flight. His two well-known letters to Aeneas Sylvius about the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> relations to the Council of Basle are printed among the works of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> (Pii II Opera Omnia, Basle 1551, p. 64).
