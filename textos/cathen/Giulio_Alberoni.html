<h1>Giulio Alberoni</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and statesman; b. 30 May, 1664, at Firenzuola in the duchy of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>; d. 26 June, 1752, at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. He was the son of very poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and laboured as a farm hand or gardener until his fifteenth year. After that he became a bellringer in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, where he gained the favourable notice of the Bishop, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and appointed a canon. The Duc de Vend&ocirc;me, in command of the French troops in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, became the patron of Alberoni, took him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1706), and made use of his talents in several important affairs. Having accompanied Vend&ocirc;me to the court of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1711, the reputation of Alberoni's talents won for him, after the death of his patron, the position of agent of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. He was very active in furthering the accession of the French candidate for the throne of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Philip V, and afterwards became the royal favourite. Upon the death of the Queen (Maria Luisa of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>), Alberoni used his influence to bring about, in 1714, a marriage between the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> King and Elisabetta Farnese, daughter of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. In consequence of this diplomatic success he became prime minister, a duke and grandee of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09565b.htm">Malaga</a>. He also established more satisfactory relations than had existed between the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> and the court of Philip V. In 1717 <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, yielding to royal pressure, created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal Deacon</a> of San Adriano. As prime minister, Alberoni's political economy was decidedly in advance of his times. He strove to make the Spanish a manufacturing nation, and so far anticipated the developments of the nineteenth century as to establish a regular mail service between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and her American colonies. He reformed many abuses in the government and instituted a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of navigation for the sons of the nobility. At the same time he did not hesitate to sacrifice the popular liberties of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to the interests of the absolute monarchy; while the foreign policy by which he sought to recover <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain's</a> lost Italian possessions, his efforts to obtain for Philip V the crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and, generally, to aggrandize the Spanish monarchy at all costs, must have led to a general <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> if they had not resulted in his own downfall (5 December, 1719). He is blamed for the unwarrantable invasion of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in spite of formal assurance to the contrary given to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. Another extravagant scheme of Alberoni's was the restoration of the Stuart to the British throne by the co-operation of the Tsar and the King of Sweden. At last, in 1719, Philip V, to save himself from being treated as the common enemy of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, dismissed and exiled the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, who returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to face the indignation of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>. His journey was interrupted at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, where he was placed under arrest to await the decision of a special commission of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. He escaped, however, and remained in hiding until the death of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> in 1721. Under the next Pope, <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>, he was cleared, by a commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, of the charges brought against him (1723), and for some time he lived in retirement in a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> house, after which he was promoted to be <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal Priest</a> of the Title of San Lorenzo in Lucina. Under <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> he served the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as Legate at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and under <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> at Bologna. Cardinal Alberoni's declining years were spent in retirement. He is buried in the church of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of San Lazzaro, which he founded at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>.
