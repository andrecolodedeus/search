<h1>Giulio Romano</h1>  

<p>Properly GIULIO DEI GIANNUZZI, also known as GIULIO PIPPI.

<p>A famous architect and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, the best-known of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> pupils, and the unique representative of the so-called "Roman School"; b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1492; d. at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> in 1546. At the age of 19, Giulio placed himself under <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, who had just finished after three years (1509-12) the Halls of the Segnatura and Heliodorus. In 1514, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> was appointed general overseer of works by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, conducted in 1519 the excavations of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and found it difficult to carry out all his undertakings. It came thus to pass that the assistant was soon the factotum and right hand of the master, who during the later portion of his career seldom found time (except for a few portraits) to take a brush into his hands.

<p>As an artist, Giulio has no originality; as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, he is merely a temp&eacute;rament, a prodigious worker. His manual dexterity is unaccompanied by any greatness of conception or high moral principle. He enlarged and executed in fresco or on canvas the drawings and studies completed by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> for his pictures. In this way were completed, within eight years, "Fire in the Borgo" (1513), the cartons of the "Acts of the Apostles" (1512-14), the loggias of the Vatican (1514-1519), the frescoes of the Farnesina (1518), and many other famous works such as the "Lo Spasimo" (Christ bearing the Cross), the "Pearl", the "Virgin with the Fish" (Madrid), the "St. Michael" of the Louvre, and "The Holy Family" executed for <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> (1518). With all his cleverness Giulio never caught the real glow of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> genius; the master's divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> became vulgarized in passing through Giulio's more material brain. Moreover he was carried away by the power of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo's</a> works (the Sistine Roof was uncovered in 1512), which, however, he misinterpreted as the brute force of physical strength. Thus <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> graceful figures often became in Giulio's hands coarse muscular giants like the "Ignudi" and the "Prophets". Giulio is also responsible for the brick-coloured tones and plaster flesh-tints of the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> later works, the artistic defects of which are in many cases entirely due to Giulio. A number of the master's most beautiful conceptions have come down to us only under this imperfect form, spoiled for ever by the triviality and lack of delicacy of the execution, and the pity of it is that, on the strength of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> signature, these works seemed to impress the seal of sanction on many serious defects in the French School of the seventeenth century. Much time and discussion would have been saved if in arguing over the famous "Transfiguration" (1520), for instance, it were admitted that in its present state, as completed by Giulio, it is impossible to say what the master's original <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was, since the secret of it is buried with him in the grave. As for the "Battle of Constantine", and the "Coronation of the Virgin", it would be as well to admit that they retain nothing whatever of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>.

<p>Although the sole interest of this early portion of Giulio's career consists in the light it throws on <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> work, it is of greater artistic importance than all Giulio's subsequent independent efforts. Yet even they are not without interest. They show us Giulio developing, though with undoubted talent, some of the defects and deadly vices which lay hidden in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> movement. The most serious of these defects is dilettanteism, or virtuosity for its own sake. Giulio had not with impunity devoted ten years simply to the execution of another's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; he came to believe that in art the thought is of no account, the form everything. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connexion between the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and its expression, between art and life, quite escaped him. This was the grave defect of the Italian spirit &#151; the abuse of art, the worship of form, the indifference to subject, and it could hardly fail to prove fatal to an artist whom it had obsessed.

<p>An opportunity of translating this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> principle to canvas on a large scale was afforded to Giulio by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. For 22 years (1524-1546) the artist was absolute master of all the works of art executed in that town. He entirely remodelled the interior decoration of the old palace (the Palazzo di Corte), lavishing on it all the resources of his inexhaustible fancy. He refashioned the interior of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; he raised the important church of San Benedetto, and he built from roof to cellar the famous Palace of Tajetto, near the gates of the town.

<p>It is especially in these two palaces, which were almost entirely <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by him or his pupils, that Giulio marks an epoch in the history of art. His lively but superficial fancy, incapable of deep emotion, of religious feeling, or even of observation, attracted him to neutral subjects, to mythological <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, and imaginary scenes from the world of fable. Therein under the cloak of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a>, he gave expression to a sensualism rather libertine than poetical, an epicureanism unredeemed by any elevated or noble quality. It is this that wins for Giulio his distinctive place in art. His conception of form was never quite original; it was always a clever and "bookish" compromise between <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. His sense of colour grows ever louder and uglier, his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are void of finesse, whatever brilliancy they show is second-hand. His single distinctive characteristic is the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> ease with which he played with the commonplaces of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagandom</a>. In this respect at least, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> like those of the "Hall of Psyche" (1532) are historical landmarks. It is the first time (even if we include the Farnesina) that an appeal is made to the senses with all the brutal frankness of a modern work. Unlike <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> "Galatea" and his "Three Graces", examples of Elysian <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in a race in the state of innocence, Giulio's decorations resemble saturnalia of lubricity itself. The vulgarity of the drawing leaves no illusion as to the nature of its intention; nothing remains of the ancient myth, thus stripped of all its ideal signification, but what serves to excite the senses. Thus art, losing all moral import, sinks inevitably to the level of a game of conventional rules, and the cloak of fiction serves only to disguise the grossness of the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a>, which have ousted every laudable ideal.

<p>Such was the result of "art for art's sake" in his case, and the danger of such principles was aggravated by the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> reverence for the antique in the sixteenth century. The word antique was held to purify and sanctify everything: all things were lawful in the name of erudition, the antique became a fetish. In the Hall of Troy (1534-1538) in the Palazzo di Corte, and in his "Triumph of Titus and <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>" in the Louvre, Giulio, following in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>, had given evidence that he too was among the learned, the connoisseurs, the men of disinterested culture, and no doubt concluded that he was thereby entitled to dispense with the claims of morality in the rest of his works. It was not long until the same specious reasoning became the fashion in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Primatice introduced it to the Court of Fontainebleau; and <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, who spent eight years (1600-1608) at the Court of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, brought it back with him to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. Giulio is the originator of those lascivious pictures, dating from 1630 to 1638, which are in the Prado and Torre de la Pareja galleries at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. Mantua, Giulio's town, rather than <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the teacher of the seventeenth century. The consequences of these principles were disastrous. The antique, indeed, could only be the religion of the few, but, by constituting fable the sole vehicle of the beautiful, Giulio, vulgarian though he was, fell into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of "aristocratizing" art, and thus of severing its indispensable bond with the real. Henceforth its public became fewer; art, becoming the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> class, was exposed to all the risks inherent in caste and party spirit. It was now a privileged possession, a code-language for use only among the initiated. Emancipated from morality (thanks to the sophism of the antique), deprived of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> support of reality, and immune from the common-sense verdict of the general public, it gave utterance only to aimless, useless, soulless, lifeless abstractions. As an example may be cited the most famous of Giulio's works, the "Hall of the Giants" (1532-1534) in the Palace of the Tajetto. It is difficult to say whether the artist was here the dupe of his <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, or whether the work was the result of a jocose wager, for it is certainly a freak, a shock like those that used to startle the yokels in the Gardens of Castello and of Pratolino. But the effect here is brought about by such palpable illusion, the imposture is so enormous, it demands so many concessions from the spectator, it presupposes such a lack of all critical power on his part, that it is hard to understand such a pleasantry, though for Giulio's sake one would gladly wish it such. The effort is so out of proportion to the result that one cannot repress a feeling of pity. Such a lack of dignity comes as a shock. There is, of course, in the Italian genius a substratum of scepticism, of irony, of parody, which outsiders can never quite realize. But was it worth while to heap Pelion on Ossa, to shake the whole world, to create such a cataclysm of colour, merely to raise a smile? Or can it be that the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of "art for art's sake" is nothing more or less than the bizarre and the burlesque?

<p>Distinguished by such characteristics and marked by such defects, Giulio Romano occupies nevertheless an important place in the history of art. More than any other, he aided in propogating the pseudo-classical, half-pagan style of art so fashionable during the seventeenth century, and it is mainly through his influence that after the year 1600 we find so few <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">religious painters</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It was reserved to a Dutchman &#151; Rembrandt &#151; to reconcile art and morality once more. By his influence as a pupil of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, Giulio contributed to spread the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> germs of Italian art &#151; carelessness of finish, bravura, lack of sincerity, lack of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, mannerism, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the grotesque. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> many altar-pieces; the best is the "Stoning of St. Stephen" in S. Stefano at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, executed before leaving <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when the mantle of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> was still on him. His Madonnas, such as the "Madonna della Gatta" (Naples), the "Madonna della Catina" (Dresden), are mere genre pictures without feeling or religious depth, having the sort of abstract beauty we expect in <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>. The "Nativity" of the Louvre is an attempt to reproduce the chiaroscuro of Corregio.
