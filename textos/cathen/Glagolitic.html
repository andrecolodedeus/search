<h1>Glagolitic</h1>  

<p>(Or G<font size=-2>LAGOLITSA</font>; Slavonic <em>glagol,</em> a word; <em>glagolati,</em> to speak).

<p>An ancient alphabet of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> languages, also called in Russian <em>bukvitsa</em>. The ancient Slavonic when reduced to writing seems to have been originally written with a kind of runic letters, which, when formed into a regular alphabet, were called the Glagolitic, that is the signs which spoke. St. Cyril, who, together with his brother St. Methodius, translated the Greek liturgy into Slavonic when he converted the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and Moravians, invented the form of letters derived from the Greek alphabet with which the church Slavonic is usually written. This is known as the Cyrillic alphabet or <em>Kirillitsa</em>. The Cyrillic form of letters is used in all the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the Greek Churches, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, which use the Slavonic language in their liturgy, and even the present Russian alphabet, the <em>Grazhdanska,</em> is merely a modified form of the Cyrillic with a few letters omitted. The order of the letters of the alphabet in the Glagolitic and in the Cyrillic is nearly the same, but the letters bear no resemblance to each other, except possibly in one or two instances. Jacic upholds the theory that St. Cyril himself invented the Glagolitic, and that his disciple St. Clement transformed it into Cyrillic by imitating the Greek uncial letters of his day. There is a tradition, however, that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who was a <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatian</a>, was the inventor. Some of the earliest <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are written in the Glagolitic characters. The Cyrillic alphabet continued to be used for writing the Slavonic in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and Galicia, while the Southern and Western <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> used the Glagolitic. These <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> by Latin missionaries, and gradually the Roman alphabet drove out the use of the Glagolitic, so that the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, Slovenians, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravians</a>, and part of the Croatians used Roman letters in writing their languages. In Southern Croatia and in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> (often treated as synonymous with <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> in ancient times) the Glagolitic has continued in use as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> alphabet in writing the ancient Slavonic. Although the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples bordering on the Adriatic Sea were converted to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, they received the privilege, as well as their brethren of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, of having the Mass and the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> said in their own tongue. Thus the Roman Mass was translated into the Slavonic, and, in order to more fully distinguish the Western Rite from the Eastern Rite among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples, the use of the Glagolitic alphabet was reserved exclusively for the service books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, just as the Cyrillic was used for the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>.

<p>The use of the Glagolitic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and office books, while permitted in general among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Croatia from the earliest times since the Slavonic became a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language under <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a>, was definitely settled by the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 29 April, 1631, in which he provided for a new and corrected edition of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> conformable to the Roman editions. In 1648 <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> provided likewise for the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and by order of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> the new edition of the Roman-Illyrian <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> was published in 1688. In the preface to this <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> speaks of the language and letters employed therein, and gives <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> the credit for the invention of the Glagolitic characters: "Quum igitur Illyricarum gentium, qu&aelig; longe lateque per Europam diffus&aelig; sunt, atque ab ipsis gloriosis Apostolorum Principibus Petro et Paulo potissimum Christi fidem edoct&aelig; fuerunt, libros sanctos jam inde a S. Hieronymi temporibus, ut pervetusta ad nos detulit traditio, vel certe a Pontificatu fel. rec. Joannis Pap&aelig; VIII, pr&aelig;decessoris nostri, uti ex ejusdem dat&#226; super e&#226; re epistola constat, ritu quidem romano, sed idiomate slavonico, et charactere S. Hieronymi vulgo nuncupato conscriptos, opportun&#226; recognitione indigere compertum sit." The new edition of the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> in Glagolitic form had previously been published in the year 1640.

<p>The latest editions of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and ritual are those of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, "Missale Romanum, Slavic&#226; lingu&#226;, glagolitico charactere" (Rome, 1893), and "Rimski Ritual (Obrednik) izdan za zapoviedi Sv. Otca Pape Paula V" (Rome, 1894). There was a former edition of the Glagolitic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, "Ordo et Canon Miss&aelig;, Slavice" (Rome, 1887), but on account of the numerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in printing and text it was destroyed, and only a few copies are in existence. The use of the Latin language in the Dalmatian <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> since the year 1828 has had the effect of increasing the use of the Latin in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> there, and the use of the Glagolitic books has accordingly diminished. Of course the non-Slavic inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Croatia have always used the Slavonic language for the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. At present the Slavonic language for the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, printed in Glagolitic characters, is used in the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> churches of the Dioceses of Zengg, <a href="../cathen/15321a.htm">Veglia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a>, and Spalato, and also by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in their three churches in <a href="../cathen/15321a.htm">Veglia</a>, one in Cherso, two in <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a>, and one in <a href="../cathen/13668d.htm">Sebenico</a>. Priests are forbidden to mingle the Slavonic and Latin languages in the celebration of the Mass, which must be said wholly in Slavonic or wholly in Latin.
