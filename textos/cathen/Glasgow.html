<h1>Glasgow</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Archdiocese of Glasgow (Glasguensis)</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in the south-west of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, comprising at the present day the Counties of Lanark, Dumbarton, and Renfrew, part of Ayrshire north of Lugton Water, the district of Baldernock in Stirlingshire, and the Cumbrae Isles. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was founded between 540 and 560 by <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">St. Kentigern</a>, or Mungo, who died 13 Jan., 601. He also established on the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> model a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, which served as a much needed centre to preserve the Faith among the surrounding <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population. In his time Cathures, as the place was originally called, stood at the northern limit of the little kingdom of the Strathclyde Britons, which extended on the west of the island southwards as far as Carlisle in Cumberland. On the north-west were the Scots of Dalriada, and on the north-east the Picts, who were then being <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by St. Columba and his missionary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>. On the east the Strathclyde Britons, like their brethren in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, were pressed by the Angles and Saxons westward to the sea.

<p>On account of the struggle of races for mastery and the confusion of the times that followed there appears to have been no regular succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> till the time of Alexander I of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, son of St. Margaret. His brother and successor on the throne, St. David, while prince of this region under the name of Cumbria, may be said to have restored the Diocese of Glasgow.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the restored see was John Eochy, or Achaius, who held it from 1115 till 1147. He had twenty-three successors in actual possession till 1560, when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was abolished by act of the Scottish Parliament. Nearly all these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Glasgow took an active share in the government of the country, whether as chancellors or treasurers of the kingdom or as members of regency during the minority of a sovereign. Robert Wishart (consecr. 1272, d. 1316) was conspicuous for his patriotism during the War of Independence, and was the close friend of Wallace and Bruce. William Turnbull (consecr. 1447, d. 1454) obtained in 1450 from <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> the charter of foundation for the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Glasgow. On 9 January, 1492, <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> raised the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank, attaching to it the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Argyle, Dumblane, <a href="../cathen/05193a.htm">Dunkeld</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>. <a href="../cathen/02374b.htm">James Beaton</a>, nephew of the <a href="../cathen/02372a.htm">celebrated cardinal</a> of the same surname, was the fourth and last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. In 1560, eight years after his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, he was forced to retire to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he acted as confidential agent of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, and later openly as ambassador for James VI, till his death in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 25 April, 1603. He carried away with him the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> records, two of which deserve special mention: (1) "Registrumn Vetus Ecclesiae Cathedralis Glasguensis", in handwriting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and (2) "Liber Ruber Ecclesiae Glasguensis", with entries from about 1400 to 1476. These, along with other records, were in 1843 printed in a handsome volume for the Maitland Club under the title: "Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis: Munimenta Ecclesiae Metropolitanae Glasguensis a sede restaurat&acirc; saeculo ineunte XII ad reformatam religionem". A more splendid memorial of those times still remains in the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Mungo, which was begun by Bishop Jocelyn (consecr. 1175, d. 1199) and received its last additions from Archbishop Blackader (consecr. 1484, d. 1508). The building as a national monument is administered by a department of Government, and the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> is used for the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> worship of the State Church.

<p>Glasgow did not again become a centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life till about the beginning of the nineteenth century. The great industrial development which then began drew to the city and its neighbourhood <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the Scottish Highlands and later, in far greater numbers, from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In 1828 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> erected the Western District or Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> to reside in Glasgow was Andrew Scott, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eretria (b. 1772, d, 1846). He was succeeded by John Murdoch, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03407c.htm">Castabala</a> (b. 1796, d. 1865) and John Gray, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hypsopolis (b. 1817, d. 1872). On the resignation of Bishop Gray in 1869 Charles Eyre (b. 1817, d. 1902) was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Anazarba and appointed administrator Apostolic. On the restoration of the Scottish <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 4 March, 1878, the Archbishopric of Glasgow was re-established, and Archbishop Eyre was transferred to the restored see. He bad consolidated the work of his predecessors in the former vicariate, and had laid the foundations for a complete <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization. In 1884 he obtained from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the erection of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter with a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and eleven canons. He introduced a thorough system of inspection in religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the archdiocese. He was also the founder in 1874 of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college for higher studies, to house which he erected in 1892 at his own cost a building worthy of the purpose. He was succeeded in 1902 by John Aloysius Maguire (b. 1851), who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> in 1894. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Glasgow district are computed at 380,000 out of a general population within the same bounds of 1,180,000. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> in 1906 was 14,785. Taking the statistics available for 1908, there are 91 quasi-parishes, with 271 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on active service distributed over 21 deaneries. There are 7 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men, and 16 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. There are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in all the quasi-parishes, besides 14 upper-schools and a training college for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers. The teaching staff of the archdiocese numbers 1230. The number of children presented in 1907 for religious examination in the elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was 55,350. There are 15 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of various kinds, and there is a conference of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> in nearly every quasi-parish.
<h2 id="section2">Glasgow University</h2>

<p>Forty years later than St. Andrews, Glasgow University was founded by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 January, 1450-1, granted at the request of James II, who acted on the advice of William Turnbull, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Glasgow. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his successors were to be ex-officio chancellors of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; the foundation also provided for a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and masters in the four faculties. Originally, it appears, most of the students enrolled were <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, especially of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>: "many of the Friars Predicators were diligent students" (Munim., i, 34) "and took a deep interest in the success of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>" (Stewart, p. xiii); and Bishop Turnbull warmly encouraged his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> both to learn and to teach. He also procured from James II a royal charter in 1453. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> constituted a "studium generale, tam in theologia ac iure canonico et civili quam in artibus et quavis alia licita facultate", after the pattern of Bologna. The foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> followed soon; it stood at first near Rotten Row; later, on a site given by Lord Hamilton in High Street, where it remained till 1870. The college (Paedagogium) was ruled by three "regents"; the students were distributed in four "nations", originally called Clidisdaliae, Thevidaliae, Albaniae, Rosay, now surviving as Glottiana, Loudoniana, Transforthana, Rothseiana. Among the most famous names in the early annals of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> are: William Elphinstone, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a> and founder (in 1494-5) of Aberdeen University; the poet Robert Henryson; <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a>; <a href="../cathen/02372a.htm">Cardinal Beaton</a>; and <a href="../cathen/02374b.htm">James Beaton</a>, his nephew, chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Glasgow in 1560, when, upon the establishment of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, he fled to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, almost destroyed in the religious troubles, was refounded by James VI, then a minor under Morton's regency, in 1577 (Nova Erectio), with increased endowments, and reorganized by Andrew Melville or Melvin. From that time it has continued to increase; Dr. Weir (op. cit.) calculated the number of students at various epochs as follows: at beginning of sixteenth century, 50; at beginning of seventeenth century, 100; at beginning of eighteenth century, 400; at beginning of nineteenth century, 700; in 1870-1, 1279; in 1889-90, 2180. In 1907-8 there were 1905 men students (arts, 691; <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, 275; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, 56; medicine, 623; law, 208). In 1892 a neighbouring institution, established in 1883, for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (Queen Margaret College) was incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and there are now some 600 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> students.

<p>The development of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> kept pace with the growth of Glasgow, and the increasing commercial importance of the city was reflected in the advance of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies. The brothers William and John Hunter, in medicine; the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> Francis Hutcheson, Thomas Reid, and Adam Smith, are the great names in the eighteenth century, as teachers; Tobias Smollett, James Boswell, Francis Jeffrey, and Thomas Campbell as students. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was also made famous by the Foulis printing press and the mechanical experiments of James Watt, inventor of the steam-engine. But perhaps the most world-wide celebrity that Glasgow University can boast is the late William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who taught and carried on his researches here for fifty years till his retirement in 1899. Sir Richard Jebb and Dr. Gilbert Murray were successively professors of Greek from 1874 to 1899; the Cairds, John and Edward, were great names in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>; and the medical faculty has been and is still graced by men of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> reputation, such as Lord Lister and Sir W. MacEwen.

<p>The government of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has been subjected to revision by royal commission many times, particularly in 1830, 1858, 1889. The old college was abandoned in 1870 for the large, and still largely expanding, buildings on Gilmorehill. The teaching staff numbers 32 professors, 50 lecturers, and 40 assistants. The total revenues from all sources (including Government annual grant of &#163;20,000) amount to about &#163;80,000. Magnificent additions to the equipment of the scientific and medical faculties have recently been made, the cost of which has been defrayed partly by the Carnegie Trust and partly by special subscription.
