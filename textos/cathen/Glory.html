<h1>Glory</h1>  

<p>This word has many shades of meaning which lexicographers are somewhat puzzled to differentiate sharply. As our interest in it here centres around its <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and religious significance, we shall treat it only with reference to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> attached to it in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Scripture</h2>

<p>In the English version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> the word Glory, one of the commonest in the Scripture, is used to translate several Hebrew terms in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and the Greek <em>doxa</em> in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> versions employ brightness, where others use glory. When this occurs, the original signifies, as it frequently does elsewhere, a physical, visible phenomenon. This meaning is found for instance in <a href="../bible/exo024.htm#vrs16">Exodus 24:16</a>: "And the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai"; in <a href="../bible/luk002.htm">Luke 2:9</a>, and in the account of the Transfiguration on Mount Thabor. In very many places the term is employed to signify the witness which the created <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> bears to the nature of its Creator, as an effect reveals the character of its cause. Frequently in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> it signifies a manifestation of the Divine Majesty, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or some other attribute through His incarnate Son, as, for instance, in <a href="../bible/joh001.htm">John 1:14</a>: "(and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; <a href="../bible/luk002.htm">Luke 2:32</a>, "A light to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the glory of thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>"; and throughout the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Christ for his disciples, <a href="../bible/joh017.htm">John 17</a>. Here too, as elsewhere, we find the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the perception of this manifested <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> works towards a union of man with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In other passages glory is equivalent to praise rendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in acknowledgment of His majesty and perfections manifested objectively in the world, or through <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation: "Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and honour, and power: because thou hast <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> all things", <a href="../bible/rev004.htm">Apocalypse 4:11</a>: "Give glory to the Lord, and call upon his name", <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#vrs1">Psalm 104:1</a>.

<p>The term is used also to mean judgment on personal worth, in which sense the Greek <em>doxa</em> reflects the signification of the cognate verb <em>dokeo</em>: "How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, you do not seek?" <a href="../bible/joh005.htm">John 5:44</a>; and <a href="../bible/joh012.htm">12:43</a>: "For they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the glory of men more than the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Lastly, glory is the name given to the blessedness of the future life in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come", Rom., viii, 18. "Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", ib., 21. The texts cited above are representative of multitudes similar in tenor, scattered throughout the sacred writings.
<h2 id="section2">Theological</h2>

<p>The radical concept present under various modifications in all the above expressions is rendered by St. Augustine as clara notitia cum laude, "brilliant celebrity with praise". The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> have accepted this definition as the centre around which they correlate their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding glory, divine and human.
<h3 id="A">Divine glory</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Eternal God</a> has by an act of His will created, that is, has brought into being from nothingness, all things that are. Infinite Intelligence, He could not act aimlessly; He had an objective for His action: He created with a purpose; He destined His creatures to some end. That end was, could be, no other than Himself; for nothing existed but Himself, nothing but Himself could be an end worthy of His action. "I am <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a>, the beginning and the end, saith the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs8">Revelation 1:8</a>); "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> hath made all things for himself" (<a href="../bible/pro016.htm#vrs4">Proverbs 16:4</a>). Did He, then, create in order that from His creatures He might derive some benefit? That, for example, as some present-day theories pretend, through the evolution of things toward a higher perfection the sum of His Being might be enlarged or perfected? Or that man by co-operating with Him might aid Him in the elimination of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which He by Himself is unable to cast out? No; such conceits are incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concept of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Infinite, He possesses the plenitude of Being and Perfection; He needs nothing, and can receive no complementary increment or superfluous accession of excellence from without. <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Omnipotent</a>, He stands in need of no assistance to carry His will into execution.

<p>But from His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> He can and does give; and from His fullness have we all received. All things are, only because they have received of Him; and the measure of His giving constitutes the limitations of their being. Contemplating the boundless ocean of His reality, He perceives it as imitable ad extra, as an inexhaustible fund of exemplar <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which may, if He so wills, be reproduced in an order of finite existence distinct from, yet dependent on His own, deriving their dower of actuality from His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> fullness which in imparting sustains no diminution. He spoke and they were made. Everything which His fiat has called into existence is a copy &mdash; finite indeed and very imperfect, yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as far as it goes &mdash; of some aspect of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfection. Each reflects in fixed limitation something of His nature and attributes. The heavens show forth His power; earth's oceans are



<blockquote><p>. . . the glorious mirror where the Almighty's form Glasses itself in tempests. . . </p></blockquote>

<p>The summer flower, though only to itself it live and die, is a silent witness before Him of His power, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and unity; and the harmonious order which binds all the innumerable parts of creation into one cosmic whole is another reflection of His oneness and His wisdom. Yet, as each part of creation is finite, so too is the totality; and therefore its capacity to reflect the Divine Prototype must result in an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> inadequate representation of the Great Exemplar. Nevertheless, the unimaginable variety of existing things conveys a vague hint of that Infinite which must ever defy any complete expression external to Itself. Now this objective revelation of the Creator in terms of the existences of things is the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is authoritatively formulated by the Council of the Vatican: "If any one shall say that the world was not created for the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (Sess. III, C. I, can. 5).

<p>This objective manifestation of the Divine nature constitutes the Universe &mdash; the book, one might say, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has recorded His greatness and majesty. As the mirror of the telescope presents an image of the star that shines and wheels in the immeasurably remote depths of space, so does this world reflect in its own fashion the nature of its Cause between Whom and it lies the gulf that separates the finite from the Infinite. The telescope, however, knows not of the image which its surface bears; the eye and mind of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> must intervene in order that the significance of the shadow and its relation to the substance may be grasped. To praise, in the exact sense of the term, demands not alone that worth be manifest, but also that there be a mind to acknowledge. The unconscious testimony of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to its Creator is rather potential than actual glory. Hence, this glory which it renders to Him is called in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> phrase <em>gloria materialis</em>, to distinguish it from the <em>formal glory</em> rendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His intelligent creatures. They can read the writing in the book of creation, understand its story, accept its lessons, and reverently praise the Majesty which it reveals. This praise involves not merely <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perception, but also the practical acknowledgment by heart and will which issues in obedience and loving service. The endowment of intelligence with all that it implies &mdash; spirituality and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> &mdash; renders man a higher and nobler image of the Creator than is any other being of this visible world. The gift of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> also imposes on man the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of returning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that formal glory of which we have just spoken. The more perfectly he discharges this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, the more does he develop and perfect that initial resemblance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which exists in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by the fulfilment of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> serves the end for which he, like all else, has been created.

<p>The natural revelation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has vouchsafed of Himself through the world interpreted by reason has been supplemented by a higher <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> manifestation which has culminated in the Incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: "and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the Father, full of grace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>". Similarly the natural resemblance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the relation of our being to His, as established by creation, are supplemented and carried into a higher order by His communication of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the medium of this supernaturally <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to serve Him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> springing from this grace is to be "Filled with the fruit of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, unto the glory and praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs11">Philippians 1:11</a>). In manifesting the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the development of their proper powers and capacities, inanimate creatures reach that perfection or fulness of existence which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prescribed for them. Likewise man achieves his perfection or subjective end by giving glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the comprehensive sense above indicated. He attains the consummation of his perfection not in this life, but in the life to come. That perfection shall consist in a direct, immediate, <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> perception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part; but then I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as I am known" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). In this transcendent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall become, in a higher measure than that which obtains by virtue of creation alone, a participant and therefore an image of the Divine nature; so "we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs2">1 John 3:2</a>). So that objectively and actively the life in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> shall be an unending ineffable manifestation and acknowledgment of the Divine majesty and perfections. Thus we understand the Scriptural language in which the future life of the blessed is described as a state in which "we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on this subject is defined by the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 588). (See <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">CREATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">GOOD</a>.)
<h3 id="B">Human glory</h3>

<p>To enjoy glory before men is to be known and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> on account of one's character, qualities, possessions, position, or achievements, real or imaginary. The moral question arises, is the desire and pursuit of this glory lawful? The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the subject is succinctly stated by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II, Q. cxxxii). Posing the question whether the desire of glory is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, he proceeds to answer it in the following sense: Glory imports the manifestation of something which is estimated honourable, whether it be a spiritual or a corporal good. Glory does not necessarily require that a large number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> shall acknowledge the excellence; the esteem of a few, or even of oneself, may suffice, as, for example, when one judges some good of his own to be worthy of praise. That any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> esteem his own good or excellence to be worthy of praise is not in itself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>; nor, in like manner, is it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> that we should desire to see our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> approved of men. "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs16">Matthew 5:16</a>). Hence the desire of glory is not essentially vicious. But a vain, or perverse desire for renown, which is called vainglory, is wrong; desire of glory becomes perverse,

<ul> <li>when one seeks renown because of something not really worthy; <li>when one seeks the esteem of those whose judgment is undiscriminating; <li>when one desires glory before men without subordinating it to righteousness.</ul>

<p>Vainglory may become a deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if one seek the esteem of men for something that is incompatible with the reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or when the thing for which one desires to be esteemed is preferred in one's affections before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or again, when the judgment of men is sought in preference to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as was the case with the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who "loved the glory of men more than the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs43">John 12:43</a>). The term "vainglory" denotes not alone the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> act, but also the vicious habit or tendency engendered by a repetition of such acts. This habit is ranked among the capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or, more properly vices, because it is prolific of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, viz., disobedience, boastfulness, <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, contentiousness, discord, and a presumptuous <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of pernicious novelties in moral and religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.
