<h1>Gnosticism</h1>  

<p>The doctrine of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. This definition, based on the etymology of the word (<em>gnosis</em> "knowledge", <em>gnostikos</em>, "good at knowing"), is correct as far as it goes, but it gives only one, though perhaps the predominant, characteristic of Gnostic systems of thought. Whereas <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and almost all <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> systems, hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> attains its proper end by obedience of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and will to the Supreme Power, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, it is markedly peculiar to Gnosticism that it places the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> merely in the possession of a quasi-intuitive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and of magic formulae indicative of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Gnostics were "people who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>", and their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at once constituted them a superior class of beings, whose present and future status was essentially different from that of those who, for whatever reason, did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. A more complete and historical definition of Gnosticism would be:

<blockquote><p>A collective name for a large number of greatly-varying and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a>-<a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, which flourished from some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> down to the fifth century, and which, while borrowing the phraseology and some of the tenets of the chief <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the day, and especially of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, held <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to be a deterioration of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, and the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> a depravation of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a>, and taught the ultimate end of all being to be the overcoming of the grossness of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and the return to the Parent-Spirit, which return they held to be inaugurated and facilitated by the appearance of some God-sent Saviour.</p></blockquote>

<p>However unsatisfactory this definition may be, the obscurity, multiplicity, and wild confusion of Gnostic systems will hardly allow of another. Many scholars, moreover, would hold that every attempt to give a generic description of Gnostic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> is labour lost.
<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>The beginnings of Gnosticism have long been a matter of controversy and are still largely a subject of research. The more these origins are studied, the farther they seem to recede in the past.

<p>Whereas formerly Gnosticism was considered mostly a corruption of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, it now seems clear that the first traces of Gnostic systems can be discerned some centuries before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> origin was already maintained by Gieseler and Neander; F. Ch. Bauer (1831) and Lassen (1858) sought to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> its relation to the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; <a href="../cathen/09280b.htm">Lipsius</a> (1860) pointed to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> as its home, and Hilgenfeld (1884) thought it was connected with later Mazdeism. Joel (1880), <a href="../cathen/15576b.htm">Weingarten</a> (1881), Koffmane (1881), Anrich (1894), and Wobbermin (1896) sought to account for the rise of Gnosticism by the influence of Greek <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the Greek mysteries, while Harnack described it as "acute Hellenization of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>".

<p>For the past twenty-five years, however, the trend of scholarship has steadily moved towards <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> the pre-Christian Oriental origins of Gnosticism. At the Fifth Congress of Orientalists (Berlin, 1882) Kessler brought out the connection between Gnosis and the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> religion. By this latter name, however, he meant not the original religion of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretistic</a> religion which arose after the conquest of Cyrus. The same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is brought out in his "Mani" seven years later. In the same year F.W. Brandt published his "Mandi&auml;ische Religion". This <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaean</a> religion is so unmistakably a form of Gnosticism that it seems beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Gnosticism existed independent of, and anterior to, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>In more recent years (1897) Wilhelm Anz pointed out the close similarity between <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> and the Gnostic theories of the Hebdomad and Ogdoad. Though in many instances speculations on the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <em>Astrallehre</em> have gone beyond all sober scholarship, yet in this particular instance the inferences made by Anz seem sound and reliable. Researches in the same direction were continued and instituted on a wider scale by W. Bousset, in 1907, and led to carefully ascertained results. In 1898 the attempt was made by M. Friedl&auml;nder to trace Gnosticism in pre-Christian <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. His opinion that the <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinic</a> term <em>Minnim</em> designated not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as was commonly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomian</a> Gnostics, has not found universal acceptance. In fact, E. Sch&uuml;rer brought sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to show that <em>Minnim</em> is the exact Armaean dialectic equivalent for <em>ethne</em>. Nevertheless Friedl&auml;nder's essay retains its value in tracing strong <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">antinomian</a> tendencies with Gnostic colouring on <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> soil.

<p>Not a few scholars have laboured to find the source of Gnostic theories on Hellenistic and, specifically, Alexandrian soil. In 1880 Joel sought to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the germ of all Gnostic theories was to be found in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Though this may be dismissed as an exaggeration, some Greek influence on the birth, but especially on the growth, of Gnosticism cannot be denied. In Trismegistic literature, as pointed out by Reitzenstein (Poimandres, 1904), we find much that is strangely akin to Gnosticism. Its <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin was defended by E. Am&eacute;lineau, in 1887, and illustrated by A. Dietrich, in 1891 (Abraxas Studien) and 1903 (Mithrasliturgie). The relation of Plotinus's <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to Gnosticism was brought out by C. Schmidt in 1901. That Alexandrian thought had some share at least in the development of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Gnosticism is clear from the fact that the bulk of Gnostic literature which we possess comes to us from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> (Coptic) sources. That this share was not a predominant one is, however, acknowledged by O. Gruppe in his "Griechische Mythologie und Religionsgeschichte" (1902). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Greek mysteries, as G. Anrich pointed out in 1894, had much in common with esoteric Gnosticism; but there remains the further question, in how far these Greek mysteries, as they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, were the genuine product of Greek thought, and not much rather due to the overpowering influence of Orientalism.

<p>Although the origins of Gnosticism are still largely enveloped in obscurity, so much light has been shed on the problem by the combined labours of many scholars that it is possible to give the following tentative solution: Although Gnosticism may at first sight appear a mere thoughtless <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> of well nigh all religious systems in antiquity, it has in reality one deep root-principle, which assimilated in every soil what is needed for its life and growth; this principle is <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/11740b.htm">pessimism</a>.

<p>The Gnostics, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, borrowed their terminology almost entirely from existing <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, but they only used it to illustrate their great <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the essential <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of this present <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to escape it by the help of magic spells and a superhuman Saviour. Whatever they borrowed, this <a href="../cathen/11740b.htm">pessimism</a> they did not borrow &#151; not from Greek thought, which was a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> acknowledgment of and homage to the beautiful and noble in this world, with a studied disregard of the element of sorrow; not from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> thought, which did not allow its elaborate speculations on retribution and judgment in the netherworld to cast a gloom on this present <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but considered the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> or evolved under the presiding wisdom of Thoth; not from Iranian thought, which held to the absolute supremacy of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> and only allowed <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman</a> a subordinate share in the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, or rather counter-creation, of the world; not from Indian <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminic</a> thought, which was <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> pure and simple, or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwelling in, nay identified with, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, rather than the Universe existing as the contradictory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not, lastly, from <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> thought, for <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> were strangely reticent as to the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after death, and saw all practical wisdom in the worship of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, or Marduk, or Assur, or Hadad, that they might live long on this earth.

<p>This utter <a href="../cathen/11740b.htm">pessimism</a>, bemoaning the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as a corruption and a calamity, with a feverish craving to be freed from the body of this death and a mad hope that, if we only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, we could by some <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystic</a> words undo the <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> spell of this <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> &#151; this is the foundation of all Gnostic thought. It has the same parent-soil as <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>; but <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, it endeavours to obtain its end by the extinction of all desire; Gnosticism is pseudo-intellectual, and trusts exclusively to magical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Moreover, Gnosticism, placed in other historical surroundings, developed from the first on other lines than <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>.

<p>When Cyrus entered Babylon in 539 B.C., two great worlds of thought met, and <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> in religion, as far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, began. Iranian thought began to mix with the ancient civilization of Babylon. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">great struggle</a> between <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, ever continuing in this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is the parent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Mazdeism, or Iranian <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>. This, and the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of numberless intermediate <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and devas, are the conviction which overcame the contentedness of <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitism</a>.

<p>On the other hand, the unshakable trust in <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, the persuasion that the planetary system had a <a href="../cathen/05791a.htm">fatalistic</a> influence on this world's affairs, stood its ground on the soil of Chaldea. The greatness of the Seven &#151; the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn &#151; the sacred Hebdomad, symbolized for millenniums by the staged towers of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, remained undiminished. They ceased, indeed, to be worshipped as deities, but they remained <em>archontes</em> and <em>dynameis</em>, rules and powers whose almost irresistible force was dreaded by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Practically, they were changed from gods to devas, or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the invaders and of the invaded effected a compromise: the astral <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Babylon was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but beyond the Hebodomad was the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> light in the Ogdoad, and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had to pass the adverse influence of the god or gods of the Hebdomad before it could ascend to the only <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> beyond. This ascent of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through the planetary spheres to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> beyond (an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> not unknown even to ancient <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> speculations) began to be conceived as a struggle with adverse powers, and became the first and predominant <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in Gnosticism.



<p>The second great component of Gnostic thought is magic, properly so called, i.e. the power <em>ex opere operato</em> of weird names, sounds, gestures, and actions, as also the mixture of elements to produce effects totally disproportionate to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. These magic formulae, which caused laughter and disgust to outsiders, are not a later and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> corruption, but an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part of Gnosticism, for they are found in all forms of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Gnosticism and likewise in Mandaeism. No Gnosis was essentially complete without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the formulae, which, once pronounced, were the undoing of the higher hostile powers. Magic is the original sin of Gnosticism, nor is it difficult to guess whence it is inherited. To a certain extent it formed part of every <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> religion, especially the ancient mysteries, yet the thousands of magic tablets unearthed is <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> show us where the rankest growth of magic was to be found. Moreover, the terms and names of earliest of Gnosticism bear an unmistakable similarity to <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> sounds and words.

<p>Gnosticism came early into contact with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, and it betrays a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, if only to reject it or borrow a few names from it. Considering the strong, well-organized, and highly-cultured <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> colonies in the Euphrates valley, this early contact with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> is perfectly natural. Perhaps the Gnostic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a Redeemer is not unconnected with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> hopes. But from the first the Gnostic conception of a Saviour is more superhuman than that of popular <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>; their <em>Manda d'Haye</em>, or <em>Soter</em>, is some immediate manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a>, a Light-King, an <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> (<em>Aion</em>), and an <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>When Gnosticism came in touch with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which must have happened almost immediately on its appearance, Gnosticism threw herself with strange rapidity into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> forms of thought, borrowed its nomenclature, acknowledged <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as Saviour of the world, simulated its <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, pretended to be an esoteric <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, flooded the world with <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Gospels, and Acts, and Apocalypses, to substantiate its claim. As <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> grew within and without the Roman Empire, Gnosticism spread as a fungus at its root, and claimed to be the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, unfit, indeed, for the vulgar crowd, but set apart for the gifted and the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. So rank was its poisonous growth that there seemed danger of its stifling <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> altogether, and the earliest Fathers devoted their energies to uprooting it. Though in reality the spirit of Gnosticism is utterly alien to that of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, it then seemed to the unwary merely a modification or refinement thereof. When domiciled on <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greek</a> soil, Gnosticism, slightly changing its barbarous and Seminitic terminology and giving its "emanatons" and "syzygies" Greek names, sounded somewhat like <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>, thought it was strongly repudiated by Plotinus. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the national worship left its mark more on Gnostic practice than on its theories.

<p>In dealing with the origins of Gnosticism, one might be tempted to mention <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, as a number of Gnostic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> seem to be borrowed from <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, where they are obviously at home. This, however, would hardly be correct. <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, as historically connected with Mani, its founder, could not have arisen much earlier than A.D. 250, when Gnosticism was already in rapid decline. <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, however, in many of its elements <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> back far beyond its commonly accepted founder; but then it is a parallel development with the Gnosis, rather than one of its sources. Sometimes <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> is even classed as a form of Gnosticism and styled Parsee Gnosis, as distinguished from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Gnosis. This classification, however, ignores the fact that the two systems, though they have the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> in common, start from different principles, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> from <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, while Gnosticism, as an <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealistic</a> <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, proceeds from the conception of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as a gradual deterioration of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>.
<h2>Doctrines</h2>

<p>Owing to the multiplicity and divergence of Gnostic theories, a detailed exposition in this article would be unsatisfactory and confusing and to acertain extent even misleading, since Gnosticism never possessed a nucleus of stable <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, or any sort of <em>depositum fidei</em> round which a number of varied developments and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> might be grouped; at most it had some leading <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which are more or less clearly traceable in different schools. Moreover, a fair <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Gnostic doctrines can be obtained from the articles on leaders and phases of Gnostic thought (e.g. <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">BASILIDES</a>; <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">VALENTINUS</a>; MARCION; <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">DOCETAE</a>; <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">DEMIURGE</a>). We shall here only indicate some main phases of thought, which can be regarded as keys and which, though not fitting all systems, will unlock most of the mysteries of the Gnosis.
<h3 id="A">Cosmogony</h3>

<p>Gnosticism is thinly disguised <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. In the beginning was the Depth; the Fulness of Being; the Not-Being God; the First Father, the <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a>, the Man; the First Source, the unknown God (<em>Bythos pleroma, ouk on theos, propator, monas, anthropos, proarche, hagnostos theos</em>), or by whatever other name it might be called. This undefined <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Something, though it might be addressed by the title of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">personal</a> Being, but, like Tad of Brahma of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, the "Great Unknown" of modern thought. The Unknown God, however, was in the beginning pure spirituality; <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> as yet was not.

<p>This source of all being causes to <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanate</a> (<em>proballei</em>) from itself a number of pure <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> forces. In the different systems these <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanations</a> are differently named, classified, and described, but the <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanation</a> theory itself is common too all forms of Gnosticism. In the Basilidian Gnosis they are called sonships (<em>uiotetes</em>), in Valentinianism they form antithetic pairs or "syzygies" (<em>syzygoi</em>); Depth and Silence produce <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">Mind</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a>; these produce <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a> and Life, these again <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">State</a> (<em>ekklesia</em>). According to Marcus, they are numbers and sounds.

<p>These are the primary roots of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. With bewildering fertility hierarchies of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are thus produced, sometimes to the number of thirty. These <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> belong to the purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Together with the source from which they <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanate</a> they form the <em>pleroma</em>.

<p>The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in one of the &AElig;ons. According to <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, it is a flaw in the last sonship; according to others it is the passion of the female <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Sophia; according to others the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the Great Archon, or &AElig;on-Creator, of the Universe.

<p>The ultimate end of all Gnosis is <em>metanoia</em>, or repentance, the undoing of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and the return to the Pleroma.
<h3 id="B">Sophia myth</h3>

<p>In the greater number of Gnostic systems an important role is played by the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Wisdom &#151; Sophia or Achamoth. In some sense she seems to represent the supreme <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principle, as for instance in the Ptolemaic system, in which the mother of the seven heavens is called Achamoth, in the <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a> system, in which <em>he ano Sophia</em>, the Wisdom above, is distinguished from <em>he kato Sophia</em>, or Achamoth, the former being the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principle of the noumenal world, and in the Archotian system, where we find a "Lightsome Mother" (<em>he meter he photeine</em>), and in which beyond the heavens of the Archons is <em>he meter ton panton</em> and likewise in the Barbelognosis, where the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> Barbelos is but the counterpart of the Unknown Father, which also occurs amongst the Ophites described by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103307.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.7.4</a>).

<p>Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> in the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">Acts of Thomas (chapter 1)</a> seems addressed to this supreme <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principle. W. Bousset's suggestion, that the Gnostic Sophia is nothing else than a disguise for the Dea Syra, the great goddess Istar, or Astarte, seems worthy of consideration. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Sophia usually plays another role; she is <em>he Prouneikos</em> or "the Lustful One", once a virginal goddess, who by her fall from original purity is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> material world.

<p>One of the earliest forms of this myth is found in <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonian</a> Gnosis, in which Simon, the Great Power, finds Helena, who during ten years had been a prostitute in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, but who is Simon's <em>ennoia</em>, or understanding, and whom his followers worshipped under the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus's</a> system, as described by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (<a href="../fathers/050106.htm">Book VI, 25-26</a>), Sophia is the youngest of the twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>. Observing the multitude of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> and the power of begetting them, she hurries back into the depth of the Father, and seeks to emulate him by producing offspring without conjugal intercourse, but only projects an <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>, a formless <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>. Upon this she is cast out of Pleroma. According to the <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a> system as described by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103100.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I</a>) and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0314.htm"><em>Against the Valentinians</em> 9</a>), Sophia conceives a passion for the First Father himself, or rather, under pretext of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> she seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, the Unknowable, and to comprehend his greatness. She should have suffered the consequence of her audacity by ultimate dissolution into the immensity of the Father, but for the Boundary Spirit. According to the Pistis Sophia (ch. xxix) Sophia, daughter of Barbelos, originally dwelt in the highest, or thirteenth <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but she is <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">seduced</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> Authades by means of a ray of light, which she mistook as an <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanation</a> from the First Father. Authades thus enticed her into Chaos below the twelve <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, where she was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> powers.

<p>According to these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Sophia; this, however, was but a <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a> development; in the older speculations the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is tacitly presupposed as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the Pleroma, and through her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> Sophia falls from the realm of light into Chaos or realm of darkness.

<p>This original <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, however, was overcome by the predominant spirit of Gnosticism, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanationism</a>. The Sophia myth is completely absent from the Basilidian and kindred systems. It is suggested, with great verisimilitude, that the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> myth of Isis was the original source of the Gnostic "lower wisdom". In many systems this <em>Kato Sophia</em> is sharply distinguished from the Higher Wisdom mentioned above; as, for instance, in the magic formula for the dead mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103121.htm">I.21.5</a>), in which the departed has to address the hostile archons thus: "I am a vessel more precious than the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> who made you. If your mother ignores the source whence she is, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> whence I am and invoke the incorruptible Sophia, whois in the Father, the mother of your mother, who has neither father nor husband. A man-woman, born from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, has made you, not knowing her mother, but thinking herself alone. But I invoke her mother." This agrees with the system minutely described by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103104.htm">I.4-5</a>), where Sophia Achamoth, or Lower Wisdom, the daughter of Higher Wisdom, becomes the mother of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>; she being the Ogdoad, her son the Hebdomad, they form a counterpart of the heavenly Ogdoad in the Pleromata. This is evidently a clumsy attempt to fuse into one two systems radically different, the Basilidian and the <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Great Archon, which is the central <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, is here transferred to Sophia, and the hybrid system ends in bewildering confusion.
<h3 id="C">Soteriology</h3>

<p>Gnostic <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not merely <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of each <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it is a cosmic process. It is the return of all things to what they were before the flaw in the sphere of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> brought <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> and imprisoned some part of the Divine Light into the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> Hyle (<em>Hyle</em>). This setting free of the light sparks is the process of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; when all light shall have left Hyle, it will be burnt up, destroyed, or be a sort of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for the Hylicoi.

<p>In Basilidianism it is the Third Filiation that is captive in <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, and is gradually being saved, now that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> has been brought to the first Archon and then to the Second Archon, to each by his respective Son; and the news has been spread through the Hebdomad by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, who died to <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeem</a> the Third Filiation.

<p>In Valentinianism the process is extraordinarily elaborate. When this world has been born from Sophia in consequence of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, Nous and Aletheia, two <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, by command of the Father, produce two new <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; these restore order in the Pleroma, and in consequence all <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> together produce a new <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, Jesus Logos, Soter, or Christ, whom they offer to the Father. Christ, the Son of Nous and Aletheia, has pity on the abortive <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> born of Sophia and gives it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. Whereupon Sophia tries to rise again to the Father, but in vain. Now the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Jesus-Soter is sent as second Saviour, he unites himself to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, at his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and becomes the Saviour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is a creature of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, a compound of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, body, and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consists in the return of his <em>pneuma</em> or <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> to the Pleroma; or if he be only a Psychicist, not a full Gnostic, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<em>psyche</em>) shall return to Achamoth. There is no <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>. (For further details and differences see <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">VALENTINUS</a>.)

<p>In <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionism</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> phase of Gnosticism, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consisted in the possession of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealed himself in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and appeared as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, and to become entirely free from the yoke of the World-Creator or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, is the end of all <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>The Gnostic Saviour, therefore, is entirely different from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> one. For the Gnostic Saviour does not <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a>. Gnosticism lacks the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be atoned for, except <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nor does the Saviour in any sense benefit the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> by vicarious sufferings. Nor, finally, does he immediately and actively affect any <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the power of grace or draw it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He was a teacher, he once brought into the world the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which alone can save. As a flame sets naphtha on fire, so the Saviour's light ignites predisposed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> moving down the stream of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Of a real Saviour who with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> human and Divine seeks out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">save</a> them, Gnosticism knows nothing.

<p>The Gnostic Saviour has no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, he is an <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;on</a>, not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; he only <em>seemed</em> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> who visited <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> seemed to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. (For a detailed exposition see <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">DOCETAE</a>.) The <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Soter is brought into the strangest relation to Sophia: in some systems he is her brother, in others her son, in other again her spouse. He is sometimes identified with Christ, sometimes with Jesus; sometimes Christ and Jesus are the same <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;on</a>, sometimes they are different; sometimes Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are identified. Gnosticism did its best to utilize the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> concept of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but never quite succeeded. She made him the Horos, or Methorion Pneuma (<em>Horos, Metherion Pneuma</em>), the Boundary-Spirit, the Sweet Odour of the Second Filiation, a companion <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;on</a> with Christos, etc., etc. In some systems he is entirely left out.
<h3 id="D">Eschatology</h3>

<p>It is the merit of recent scholarship to have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Gnostic <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a>, consisting in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> struggle with hostile archons in its attempt to reach the Pleroma, is simply the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> ascent, in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, through the realms of the seven planets to Anu.

<p><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/04166.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VI.31</a>), referring to the Ophitic system, gives us the names of the seven archons as Jaldabaoth, Jao, Sabaoth, Adonaios, Astaphaios, Ailoaios, and Oraios, and tells us that Jaldabaoth is the planet Saturn. Astraphaios is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the planet Venus, as there are gnostic gems with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> figure and the legend <em>ASTAPHE</em>, which name is also used in magic spells as the name of a goddess. In the <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaean</a> system Adonaios represents the Sun. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> tells us: "Sanctam Hebdomadem VII stellas, quas dictunt planetas, esse volunt." It is safe, therefore, to take the above seven Gnostic names as designating the seven stars, then considered planets,

<ul><li>Jaldabaoth (Child of Chaos? &#151; Saturn, called "the Lion-faced", <em>leontoeides</em>) is the outermost, and therefore the chief ruler, and later on the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> par excellence. <li>Jao (<em>Iao</em>, perhaps from Jahu, <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jahveh</a>, but possibly also from the magic cry <em>iao</em> in the mysteries) is Jupiter. <li>Sabaoth (the Old-Testament title &#151; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Hosts) was misunderstood; "of hosts" was thought a proper name, hence Jupiter Sabbas (<em>Jahve <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a></em>) was Mars. <li>Astaphaios (taken from magic tablets) was Venus. <li>Adonaios (from the Hebrew term for "the Lord", used of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Adonis of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a> representing the Winter sun in the cosmic tragedy of Tammuz) was the Sun; <li>Ailoaios, or sometimes Ailoein (Elohim, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>), Mercury; <li>Oraios (Jaroah? or light?), the Moon.</ul>

<p>In the hellenized form of Gnosticism either all or some of these names are replaced by personified <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Authadia (<em>Authades</em>), or Audacity, is the obvious description of Jaldabaoth, the presumptuous <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, who is lion-faced as the Archon Authadia. Of the Archons Kakia, Zelos, Phthonos, Errinnys, Epithymia, the last obviously represents Venus. The number seven is obtained by placing a proarchon or chief archon at the head. That these names are only a disguise for the Sancta Hebdomas is clear, for Sophia, the mother of them, retains the name of Ogdoas, Octonatio. Occasionally one meets with the Archon <em>Esaldaios</em>, which is evidently the El Shaddai of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and he is described as the Archon "number four" (<em>harithmo tetartos</em>) and must represent the Sun.

<p>In the system of the Gnostics mentioned by Epiphanius we find, as the Seven Archons, Iao, Saklas, Seth, David, Eloiein, Elilaios, and Jaldabaoth (or no. 6 Jaldaboath, no. 7 Sabaoth). Of these, Saklas is the chief <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>; Elilaios is probably connected with En-lil, the Bel of Nippur, the ancient god of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. In this, as in several other systems, the traces of the planetary seven have been obscured, but hardly in any have they become totally effaced. What tended most to obliterate the sevenfold distinction was the identification of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Lawgiver, with Jaldabaoth and his designation as World-creator, whereas formerly the seven planets together ruled the world. This confusion, however, was suggested by the very fact that at least five of the seven archons bore <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> names for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; El Shaddai, <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a>, <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Elohim</a>, <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a>, <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>.
<h3 id="E">Doctrine of the primeval man</h3>

<p>The speculations on Primeval Man (<em>Protanthropos</em>, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>) occupy a prominent place in several Gnostic systems.

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103129.htm">I.29.3</a>) the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Autogenes emits the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect Anthr&ocirc;pos, also called Adamas; he has a helpmate, "Perfect Knowledge", and receives an irresistible force, so that all things rest in him. Others say (<a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103130.htm">I.30</a>) there is a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> and incorruptible and endless light in the power of Bythos; this is the Father of all things who is invoked as the First Man, who, with his Enn&oelig;a, emits <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">"the Son of Man"</a>, or Euteranthr&ocirc;pos.

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> in the name of Anthr&ocirc;pos and overawes the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the pre-existent man (<em>tou proontos anthropou</em>). In the <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a> syzygies and in the <a href="../cathen/09649b.htm">Marcosian</a> system we meet in the fourth (originally the third) place Anthr&ocirc;pos and Ecclesia. In the Pistis Sophia the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Jeu is called the First Man, he is the overseer of the Light, messenger of the First Precept, and constitutes the forces of the Heimarmene. In the Books of the Jeu this "great Man" is the King of the Light-treasure, he is enthroned above all things and is the goal of all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. According to the Naassenes, the Protanthropos is the first element; the fundamental being before its differentiation into <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">"The Son of Man"</a> is the same being after it has been individualized into existing things and thus sunk into <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.

<p>The Gnostic Anthr&ocirc;pos, therefore, or <em>Adamas</em>, as it is sometimes called, is a <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> element, pure <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as distinct from <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> conceived hypostatically as <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanating</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not yet darkened by contact with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. This <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is considered as the <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> itself, as a personified <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03433a.htm">category</a> without corporeality, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> conceived as the World-Soul.

<p>This speculation about the Anthr&ocirc;pos is completely developed in <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, where, in fact, it is the basis of the whole system. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in danger of the power of darkness, creates with the help of the Spirit, the five worlds, the twelve elements, and the Eternal Man, and makes him combat the darkness. But this Man is somehow overcome by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and swallowed up by darkness. The present <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is in throes to deliver the captive Man from the powers of darkness. In the Clementine Homilies the <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> Anthr&ocirc;pos is strangely mixed up with the historical figure of the first man, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> "was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, running through all ages, and hastening to rest"; "the Christ, who was from the beginning and is always, who was ever present to every generation in a hidden manner indeed, yet ever present". In fact <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was, to use <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> language, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> <a href="../cathen/07682a.htm">immanent</a> in the world and ever manifesting itself to the inner <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>.

<p>The same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, somewhat modified, occurs in Hermetic literature, especially the "Poimandres". It is elaborated by <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, makes an ingenious distinction between the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> first "after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image and likeness" and the historic figures of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> afterwards. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <em>kat eikona</em> is: "Idea, Genus, Character, belonging to the world, of Understanding, without body, neither male nor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>; he is the Beginning, the Name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, incorruptible" (De opif. mund., 134-148; De conf. ling., 146). These <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in Talmudism, Philonism, Gnosticism, and Trismegistic literature, all come from once source, the late Mazdea development of the Gayomarthians, or worshipper of the Super-Man.
<h3 id="F">The Barbelo</h3>

<p>This Gnostic figure, appearing in a number of systems, the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a>, the "Gnostics" of Epiphanius, the Sethians, the system of the "Evangelium Mariae" and that in <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103129.htm">I.29.2 sq.</a>, remains to a certain extent an enigma. The name <em>barbelo, barbeloth, barthenos</em> has not been explained with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. In any case she represents the supreme <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principle, is in fact the highest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> in its <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> aspect. Barbelo has most of the functions of the <em>ano Sophia</em> as described above. So prominent was her place amongst some Gnostics that some schools were designated as Barbeliotae, Barbelo worshippers of Barbelognostics. She is probably none other than the Light-Maiden of the Pistis Sophia, the <em>thygater tou photos</em> or simply the Maiden, <em>parthenos</em>. In Epiphanius (Haer., xxvi, 1) and <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a> (Haer., xxxiii) Parthenos (Barbelos) seems identical with Noria, whoplays a great role as wife either of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> or of Seth. The suggestion, that Noria is "Maiden", <em>parthenos</em>, Istar, Athena, Wisdom, Sophia, or Archamoth, seems worthy of consideration.
<h2>Rites</h2>

<p>We are not so well informed about the practical and ritual side of Gnosticism as we are about its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and theoretical side. However, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us's</a> account of the <a href="../cathen/09649b.htm">Marcosians</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus's</a> account of the <a href="../cathen/05372a.htm">Elcesaites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> portions of the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">"Acta Thomae"</a>, some passages in the Pseudo-Clementines, and above all Coptic Gnostic and <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaean</a> literature gives us at least some insight into their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> practices.
<h3 id="A">Baptism</h3>

<p>All Gnostic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> possessed this <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> in some way; in Mandaeism daily <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is one of the great practices of the system. The formulae used by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Gnostics seem to have varied widely from that enjoyed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09649b.htm">Marcosians</a> said: "In [<em>eis</em>] the name of the unknown Father of all, in [<em>eis</em>] the Truth, the Mother of all, in him, who came down on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> [<em>eis ton katelthonta eis Iesoun</em>]". The <a href="../cathen/05372a.htm">Elcesaites</a> said: "In [<em>en</em>] the name of the great and highest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in the name of his Son, the great King". In <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103121.htm">I.21.3</a>) we find the formula: "In the name that was hidden from every divinity and lordship and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which [name] <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus the Nazarene</a> has put on in the regions of light" and several other formulae, which were sometimes pronounced in Hebrew or Aramaic. The <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaeans</a> said: "The name of the Life and the name of the Manda d'Haye is named over thee". In connection with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> the <em>Sphragis</em> was of great importance; in what the seal or sign consisted wherewith they were marked is not easy to say. There was also the tradition of a name either by utterance or by handing a tablet with some mystic word on it.
<h3 id="B">Confirmation</h3>

<p>The anointing of the candidate with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, or odoriferous ointment, is a Gnostic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> which overshadows the importance of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. In the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">"Acta Thomae"</a>, so some scholars maintain, it had completely replaced <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and was the sole <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of initiation. This however is not yet <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09649b.htm">Marcosians</a> went so far as to reject <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Christian baptism</a> and to substitute a mixture of oil and water which they poured over the head of the candidate. By <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> the Gnostics intended not so much to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as to seal the candidates against the attacks of the archons, or to drive them away by the sweet odour which is above all things (<em>tes uter ta hola euodias</em>). The <a href="../cathen/02226a.htm">balsam</a> was somehow supposed to have flowed from the Tree of Life, and this tree was again mystically connected with the Cross; for the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> is in the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">"Acta Thomae"</a> called "the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in which the Cross is shown to us".
<h3 id="C">The Eucharist</h3>

<p>It is remarkable that so little is known of the Gnostic substitute for the Eucharist. In a number of passages we read of the breaking of the bread, but in what this consisted is not easy to determine. The use of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> in this <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> seems to have been important (Clement, Hom. xiv), for we read distinctly how St. Peter broke the bread of the Eucharist and "putting <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> thereon, he gave first to the mother and then to us". There is furthermore a great likelihood, though no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, that the Eucharist referred to in the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">"Acta Thomae"</a> was merely a breaking of bread without the use of the cup. This point is strongly controverted, but the contrary can hardly be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a>. It is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Gnostics often substituted water for the <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> (<a href="../fathers/0823.htm">Acta Thomae</a>, Baptism of Mygdonia, ch. cxxi). What formula of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was used we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> was certainly <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">signed with the Cross</a>. It is to be noted that the Gnostics called the Eucharist by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificial</a> terms &#151; <em>prosphora</em>, "oblation", <em>Thysia</em> (II bk. of Je&ucirc;, 45). In the Coptic Books (Pistis Sophia, 142; II Je&ucirc;, 45-47) we find a long description of some apparently Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> carried out by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself. In these fire and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, two flasks, and also two cups, one with water, the other with wine, and branches of the vine are used. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crowns the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> with olive wreaths, begs <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> to come and change <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> into water for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, puts herbs in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles'</a> mouths and hands. Whether these actions in some sense reflect the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> of Gnosticism, or are only <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginations</a> of the author, cannot be decided. The Gnostics seem also to have used oil sacramentally for the healing of the sick, and even the dead were anointed by them to be rendered safe and invisible in their transit through the realms of the archons.
<h3 id="D">The Nymph&ocirc;n</h3>

<p>They possessed a special Gnostic <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the bridechamber (<em>nymphon</em>) in which, through some symbolical actions, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were wedded to their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the Pleroma. Details of its <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> are not as yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> alluded to them in the words "Eleusinia fecerunt lenocinia".
<h3 id="E">The magic vowels</h3>

<p>An extraordinary prominence is given to the utterance of the vowels: <em>alpha, epsilon, eta, iota, omicron, upsilon, omega</em>. The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are supposed in the midst of their sentences to have broken out in an interminable gibberish of only vowels; magic spells have come down to us consisting of vowels by the fourscore; on <a href="../cathen/01443a.htm">amulets</a> the seven vowels, repeated according to all sorts of artifices, form a very common <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a>. Within the last few years these Gnostic vowels, so long a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, have been the object of careful study by Ruelle, Poir&eacute;e, and <a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, and it may be considered <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a> that each vowel represents one of the seven planets, or archons; that the seven together represent the Universe, but without consonants they represent the Ideal and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">Infinite</a> not yet imprisoned and limited by <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>; that they represent a musical scale, probably like the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian</a> 1 tone re-re, or d, e, f, g, a, b, c, and many a Gnostic sheet of vowels is in fact a sheet of music. But research on this subject has only just begun. Among the Gnostics the Ophites were particularly fond of representing their <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> speculations by diagrams, circles within circles, squares, and parallel lines, and other mathematical figures combined, with names written within them. How far these sacred diagrams were used as symbols in their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.
<h2>Schools of Gnosticism</h2>

<p>Gnosticism possessed no central authority for either <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>; considered as a whole it had no organization similar to the vast organization of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was but a large conglomeration of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionism</a> alone attempted in some way to rival the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionism</a> had no unity. No other classification of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> is possible than that according to their main trend of thought. We can therefore distinguish: (a) <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> or <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a>; (b) Hellenistic or Alexandrian; (c) <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a>; (d) <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">antinomian</a> Gnostics.
<h3 id="A">The Syrian school</h3>

<p>This school represents the oldest phase of Gnosticism, as Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> was the birthplace of the movement. <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, Menander, <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, Cerdo, Saturninus Justin, the <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanites</a>, Sevrians, <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, Ophites, Naassenes, the Gnostics of the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">"Acts of Thomas"</a>, the Sethians, the Peratae, the <a href="../cathen/03143a.htm">Cainites</a> may be said to belong to this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>The more fantastic elements and elaborate genealogies and syzygies of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> of the later Gnosis are still absent in these systems. The terminology is some barbarous form of <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a>; <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is the symbolic name for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> land of bondage.

<p>The opposition between the good God and the World-Creator is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> or <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a>, though there is strong <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> opposition to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He is the last of the seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who fashioned this world out of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> pre-existent <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demiurgic</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, attempting to create <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> but a miserable worm, to which the Good God, however, gave the spark of divine life. The rule of the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">god of the Jews</a> must pass away, for the good God calls us to his own immediate service through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> his Son. We <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Deity</a> by <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstaining</a> from flesh meat and marriage, and by leading an ascetic life.

<p>Such was the system of Saturninus of Antioch, who taught during the reign of Hadrian (c. A.D. 120). The Naassenes (from <em>Nahas</em>, the Hebrew for serpent) were worshippers of the serpent as a symbol of wisdom, which the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">God of the Jews</a> tried to hide from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The Ophites (<em>ophianoi</em>, from <em>ophis</em>, serpent), who, when transplanted on Alexandrian soil, supplied the main <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Valentinianism, become one of the most widely spread <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of Gnosticism. Though not strictly serpent-worshippers, they recognized the serpent as symbol of the supreme <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanation</a>, Achamoth or Divine Wisdom. They were styled Gnostics <em>par excellence</em>. The Sethians saw in Seth the father of all spiritual (<em>pneumatikoi</em>) men; in <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> and Abel the father of the psychic (<em>psychikoi</em>) and hylic (<em>hylikoi</em>) men. According to the Peratae there exists a trinity of Father, Son, and Hyle (Matter). The Son is the Cosmic Serpent, who freed <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> from the power of the rule of Hyle.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> they symbolized by a triangle enclosed in a circle. The number three is the key to all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. There are three supreme principles: the not-generated, the self-generated, the generated. There are three logoi, of gods; the Saviour has a threefold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, threefold body, threefold power, etc. They are called Peretae (<em>peran</em>) because they have "crossed over" out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> of generation. They are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Hebrews, in fact (the word comes from the Hebrew meaning "to cross over"). The Peratae were founded by Euphrates and Celbes (Acembes?) and Ademes. This Euphrates, whose name is perhaps connected with the name Peratae itself, is said to be the founder of the Ophites mentioned by <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> about A.D. 175. The <a href="../cathen/03143a.htm">Cainites</a> were so called because they <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, and the Sodomites, and <a href="../cathen/04361a.htm">Core</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, because they had all resisted the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">god of the Jews</a>.
<h3 id="B">The Hellenistic or Alexandrian school</h3>

<p>These systems were more abstract, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and self-consistent than the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> nomenclature was almost entirely replaced by Greek names. The <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> problem had outgrown all proportions, the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> side was less prominent, <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> less strictly enforced.

<p>The two great thinkers of this school were <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>.

<p>Though born at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> founded his school in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (c. A.D. 130), and was followed by his son Isidorus. His system was the most consistent and sober <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanationism</a> that Gnosticism ever produced. His school never spread so widely as the next to be mentioned, but in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> it survived for several centuries.

<p><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, who taught first at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and then at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (c. A.D. 160), elaborated a system of sexual duality in the process of <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">emanation</a>; a long series of male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> pairs of personified <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is employed to bridge over the distance from the unknown <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to this present world. His system is more confused than Basilidianism, especially as it is disturbed by the intrusion of the figure or figures of <em>Sophia</em> in the <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> process. Being <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> Ophitism in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> guise, it can claim to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> representative of the Gnostic spirit.

<p>The <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of these unbridled speculations can be seen in the Pitis Sophia, which is light-maidens, paralemptores, spheres, Heimarmene, thirteen <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>, light-treasures, realms of the midst, realms of the right and of the left, Jaldabaoth, Adamas, Michael, Gabriel, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Saviour, and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> without number whirl past and return like <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04618b.htm">dance</a>. The impression created on the same reader can only be fitly described in the words of "Jabberwocky": "gyre and gimble on the wabe".

<p>We learn from <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103435.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> IV.35</a>), <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0314.htm"><em>Against the Valentinians</em> 4</a>) and <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (Exc. ex Theod., title) that there were two main schools of Valentinianism, the Italian and the Anatolian or <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a>. In the Italian school were teachers of note: Secundus, who divided the Ogdoad within the Pleroma into two tetrads, Right and Left; Epiphanes, who described this Tetras as Monotes, Henotes, Monas, and To Hen; and possibly Colorbasus, unless his name be a misreading of <em>Kol Arba</em> "All Four". But the most important were Ptolemy and Heracleon.

<p>Ptolemy is especially <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to fame by his letter to Flora, a noble lady who had written to him as Prom Presbyter (Texte u. Unters., N.S., XIII, Anal. z. alt. Gesch. d. Chr.) to explain the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. This Ptolemy split up the names and numbers of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> into personified <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substances</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deity</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> relates. He was given to <a href="../bible/index.html">Biblical</a> studies, and was a man of unbridled <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02104.htm"><em>Stromata</em> IV.9.73</a>) calls Heracleon the most eminent teacher of the <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a> school. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> devotes a large part of his <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentary</a> on St. John to combating Heracleon's <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentary</a> on the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>. Heracleon called the source of all being Anthropos, instead of Bythos, and rejected the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> &#151; meaning, probably, the merely psychic element. He apparently stood nearer to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than Ptolemy and was a man of better judgment.

<p><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> mentions two other names (<a href="../fathers/0314.htm"><em>Against the Valentinians</em> 4</a>), Theotimus and (<a href="../fathers/0315.htm"><em>On the Flesh of Christ</em> 17</a>) Alexander.

<p>The Anatolian school had as a prominent teacher Axionicus (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0314.htm"><em>Against the Valentinians</em> 4</a>; Hippolytus, <a href="../fathers/050106.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> VI.30</a>) who had his <em>collegium</em> at Antioch about A.D. 220, "the master's most faithful <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>". Theodotus is only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us from the fragment of his writings preserved by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>. <a href="../cathen/09650b.htm">Marcus the Conjuror's</a> system, an elaborate speculation with ciphers and numbers, is given by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103111.htm">I.11-12</a>) and also by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103642.htm">VI.42</a>). <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus's</a> account of <a href="../cathen/09650b.htm">Marcus</a> was repudiated by the <a href="../cathen/09649b.htm">Marcosians</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> asserts that they did so without reason. <a href="../cathen/09650b.htm">Marcus</a> was probably an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>.

<p>A system not unlike that of the <a href="../cathen/09649b.htm">Marcosians</a> was worked out by Monoimus the Arabian, to whom <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> devotes <a href="../fathers/050108.htm">chapters 5 to 8 of Book VIII</a>, and who is mentioned only by <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a> besides him. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> is right in calling these two Gnostics imitations of <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. According to the Epistles of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinian</a> <em>collegia</em> existed in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> up to his own times (d. 363).
<h3 id="C">The Dualistic school</h3>

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> was indeed congenital with Gnosticism, yet but rarely did it overcome the main tendency of Gnosticism, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. This, however, was certainly the case in the system of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who distinguished between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as between two <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> principles, the first being <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a>, <em>agathos</em>; the second merely <em>dikaios</em>, or just; yet even <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> did not carry this system to its ultimate consequences. He may be considered rather as a forerunner of Mani than a pure Gnostic. Three of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Potitus, Basilicus, and Lucanus, are mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> as being true to their master's <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.13</a>), but <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, his chief <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, though he went farther than his master in rejecting the Old-Testament Scriptures, returned to <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> by considering the Inspirer of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a> to be not a god, but an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil angel</a>. On the other hand, Syneros and Prepon, also his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, postulated three different principles. A somewhat different <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> was taught by Hermogenes in the beginning of the second century at Carthage. The opponent of the good God was not the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">God of the Jews</a>, but Eternal Matter, the source of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This Gnostic was combatted by <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>.
<h3 id="D">The Antinomian school</h3>

<p>As a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">moral law</a> was given by the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">God of the Jews</a>, and opposition to the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">God of the Jews</a> was a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, the breaking of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">moral law</a> to spite its give was considered a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Such a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a>, existed in <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> times, their principle, according to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, was <em>parachresthai te sarki</em>. Carpocrates, whom <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0310.htm"><em>On the Soul</em> 35</a>) calls a magician and a fornicator, was a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>. One could only escape the cosmic powers through discharging one's <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to them by <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> conduct. To disregard all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and sink oneself into the <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a> by remembering one's pre-existence in the Cosmic Unit &#151; such was the Gnosis of Carpocrates. His son Epiphanes followed his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> so closely that he died in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> at the age of seventeen. <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomian</a> views were further maintained by the Prodicians and Antitactae. No more ghastly instance of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">insane</a> immorality can be found than the one mentioned in Pistis Sophia itself as practised by some Gnostics. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter26"><em>First Apology</em> 26</a>), <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103125.htm">I.25.3</a>) and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.7</a>) make it clear that "the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of these men brought <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> upon the whole race of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>".
<h2>Literature</h2>

<p>The Gnostics developed an astounding literary activity, which produced a quantity of writings far surpassing contemporary output of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. They were most prolific in the sphere of fiction, as it is safe to say that three-fourths of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> romances about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> emanated from Gnostic circles. Besides these &#151; often crude and clumsy &#151; romances they possessed what may be called <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">"theosophic"</a> treatises and revelations of a highly <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> character. These are best described as a stupefying roar of bombast occasionally interrupted by a few words of real sublimity. Traine remarks with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: "Anyone who reads the teachings of the Gnostics breathes in an atmosphere of fever and fancies himself in a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, amongst delirious patients, who are lost in gazing at their own teeming thought and who fix their lustrous eyes on empty <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">space</a>" (Essais de crit. et d'histoire, Paris, 1904). Gnostic literature, therefore, possesses little or no intrinsic value, however great its value for <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> and <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>. It is of unparalleled importance in the study of the surroundings in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> first arose. The bulk of it is unfortunately no longer extant. With the exception of some Coptic translations and some expurgated or Catholicized <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> versions, we possess only a number of fragments of what once must have formed a large <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Most of this literature will be found catalogued under the names of Gnostic authors in the articles <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">BASILIDES</a>; <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">BARDESANES</a>; <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">CERINTHUS</a>; MARCION; <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">SIMON MAGUS</a>; <a href="../cathen/12553c.htm">PTOLEMY</a>; <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">VALENTINUS</a>. We shall enumerate in the following paragraphs only anonymous Gnostic works and such writings as are not attributed to any of the above authors.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a> possessed "some books under the name of Jaldabaoth", a book called "N&ocirc;ria" (the mythical wife of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>), <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Barcabbas, who was a soothsayer among the <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a>, a "Gospel of the Consummation", and a kind of apocalypse called "the Gospel of Eva" (Epiphanius, Adv. Haer., xxv, xxvi; <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a>, 33). The Ophites possessed "thousands" of <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a>, as Epiphanius tells us; among these he specially mentions: "Questions of Mary, great and small" (some of these questions are perhaps extant in the Pistis Sophia); also many books under the name of "Seth", "Revelations of Adam", <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">Apocryphal</a> Gospels attributed to <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>; an Apocalypse of Elias, and a book called "Genna Marias". Of these writings some <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Seth, eight in number, are probably extant in an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> translation, published in the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarist</a> collection of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> (Venice, 1896). See Preuschen "Die apocryph. Gnost. Adamschr." (Giessen, 1900). The <a href="../cathen/03143a.htm">Cainites</a> possessed a "Gospel of Judas", an "Ascension of Paul" (<em>anabatikon Paulou</em>) and some other book, of which we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the title, but which, according to Epiphanius, was full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. The Prodicians, according to <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, possessed <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> under the name of Zoroaster (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.15.69</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomians</a> had an apocryphon "full of audacity and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>" (<a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.4.29</a>; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, "In Matth,", xxviii). The Naassenes had a book out of which <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> largely quotes, but of which we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the title. It contained a <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentary</a> on <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> texts, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a>. The Peratae possessed a similar book. The Sethians possessed a "Paraphrasis Seth", consisting of seven books, explanatory of their system, a book called <em>Allogeneis</em>, or "Foreigners", an "Apocalypse of Adam", a book attributed to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and others. The <a href="../cathen/01697a.htm">Archontians</a> possessed a large and small book entitled "Symphonia"; this possibly extant in Pitra's "Analecta Sacra" (Paris, 1888). The Gnostics attacked by Plotinus possessed <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> attributed to Zoroaster, Zostrian, Nichotheus, Allogenes (the Sethian Book "Allogeneis"?), and others.

<p>In addition to these writings the following <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> are evidently of Gnostic authorship:
<ul><li>"The Gospel of the Twelve" &#151; This is first referred to by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. I, in Luc.), is identical with the Gospel of the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, and is also called the "Gospel according to Matthew", because in it <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> refers to <a href="../cathen/10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> in the second person, and the author speaks of the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and himself as "we". This Gospel was written before A.D. 200, and has no connection with the so-called Hebrew St. Matthew or the Gospel according to the Hebrews.
<li>"The Gospel according to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>", i.e. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countryfolk of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, not Alexandrians. It was written about A.D. 150 and referred to by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02103.htm"><em>Stromata</em> III.9.63 and III.13.93</a>) and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. I, in Luc), and was largely used in non-Catholic circles. Only small fragments are extant in <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/0210.htm"><em>Stromata</em></a> and <a href="../fathers/0802.htm">Excerpts of Theodotus</a>). Some people have referred the Oxyrhynchus "Logia" and the <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> Coptic papyri to this Gospel, but this is a mere guess.
<li><a href="../fathers/1001.htm">"The Gospel of Peter"</a>, written about A.D. 140 in Antioch (see <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">DOCETAE</a>). Another Petrine Gospel, see description of the Ahmin <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codex</a>.
<li>A "Gospel of Matthias" written about A.D. 125, used in Basilidian circles.
<li>A "Gospel of Philip" and a <a href="../fathers/0846.htm">"Gospel of Thomas"</a>. According to the Pistis Sophia, the three <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> Matthew [read <a href="../cathen/10066a.htm">Matthias</a>], Thomas, and Philip received a Divine commission to report all <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. The <a href="../fathers/0846.htm">Gospel of Thomas</a> must have been of considerable length (1300 lines); part of it, in an expurgated recension, is possibly extant in the once popular, but vulgar and foolish, "Stories of the Infancy of Our Lord by Thomas, an Israelite philosopher", of which two Greek, as Latin, a <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic</a> version exist.
<li>"Acts of Peter" (<em>Praxis Petrou</em>), written about A.D. 165. Large fragments of this Gnostic production have been preserved to us in the original Greek and also in a Latin translation under the title of "Martyrdom of the Holy Apostle Peter", to which the Latin adds, "a Lino episcopo conscriptum". Greater portions of this apocryphon are translated in the so-called "Actus Petri cum Simone", and likewise in Sahidic and <a href="../cathen/14041b.htm">Slavonic</a>, Arabic, and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> versions. These fragments have been gathered by <a href="../cathen/09280b.htm">Lipsius</a> and Bonnet in "Acta apostolorum apocr." (Leipzig, 1891), I. Though these recensions of the "Acts of Peter" have been somewhat Catholicized, their Gnostic character is unmistakable, and they are of value for Gnostic symbolism.
<li>Closely connected with the "Acts of Peter" are the <a href="../fathers/0819.htm">"Acts of Andrew"</a> and the <a href="../fathers/0827.htm">"Acts of John"</a>, which three have perhaps one and the same author, a certain Leucius Charinus, and were written before A.D. 200. They have come down to us in a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> recensions and in different versions. For the <a href="../fathers/0819.htm">"Acts of Andrew"</a> see Bonnet, "Acta", as above (1898), II, 1, pp. 1-127; for <a href="../fathers/0827.htm">"Acts of John"</a>, ibid., pp. 151-216. To find the primitive Gnostic form in the bewildering variety and multiplicity of fragments and modifications is still a task for scholars.
<li>Of paramount importance for the understanding of Gnosticism are the <a href="../fathers/0823.htm">"Acts of Thomas"</a>, as they have been preserved in their entirety and contain the earliest Gnostic ritual, poetry, and speculation. They exist in two recensions, the Greek and the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>. It seems most likely, though not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, that the original was <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>; it is suggested that they were written about A.D. 232, when the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">St. Thomas</a> were translated to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. Of the greatest value are the two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">Consecration</a>, the "Ode to Wisdom" and the "Hymn of the Soul", which are inserted in the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> narrative, and which are wanting in the Greek Acts, though independent Greek texts of these passages are extant (<a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> with English translation by W. Wright, "Apocr. Acts of the Apost.", London, 1871). The "Hymn to the Soul" has been translated many times into English, especially, by A. Bevan, "Texts and Studies", Cambridge, 1897; cf. F. Burkitt in "Journal of Theological Studies" (Oxford, 1900). The most complete edition of the Greek Acts is by M. Bonnet in "Acta", as above, II, 2 (Leipzig, 1903; see <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">BARDESANES</a>). The Acts, though written in the service of Gnosticism, and full of the weirdest adventures, are not entirely without an historical background.</ul>

<p>There are a number of other <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> in which scholars have claimed to find traces of Gnostic authorship, but these traces are mostly vague and unsatisfactory. In connection with these undoubtedly Gnostic <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a> mention must be made of the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that these are more often classed under Judaistic than under strictly Gnostic literature, but their affinity to Gnostic speculations is at least a first sight so close and their connection with the Book of Elxai (cf. <a href="../cathen/05372a.htm">ELCESAITES</a>) so generally recognized that they cannot be omitted in a list of Gnostic writings. If the theory maintained by Dom Chapman in "The Date of the Clementines" (Zeitschrift f. N. Test. Wiss., 1908) and in the article <a href="../cathen/04039b.htm">CLEMENTINES</a> in the Catholic Encyclopedia be correct, and consequently Pseudo-Clemens be a crypto-Arian who wrote A.D. 330, the "Homilies" might still have at least some value in the study of Gnosticism. But Dom Chapman's theory, though ingenious, is too daring and as yet too unsupported, to justify the omission of the "Homilies" in this place.

<p>A great, if not the greatest, part of Gnostic literature, which has been saved from the general wreck of Gnostic writings, is preserved to us in three <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>, commonly called the Askew, the Bruce, and the Akhmim <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codex</a>. The Askew <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codex</a>, of the fifth of sixth century, contains the lengthy treatise "Pistis Sophia", i.e. Faith-Wisdom. This is a work in four books, written between A.D. 250 and 300; the fourth book, however, is an adaptation of an earlier work. The first two books describe the fall of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Sophia and her <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a> Soter; the last two books describe the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the need of Gnostic repentance. In fact the whole is a treatise on repentance, as the last two books only apply in practice the example of penance set by Sophia. The work consists of a number of questions and answers between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in which five "Odes of Solomon", followed by <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> adaptations of the same, are inserted. As the questioning is mostly done by Mary, the Pistis Sophia is probably identical with the "Questions of Mary" mentioned above. The <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codex</a> also contains extracts from the "Book of the Saviour". The dreary monotony of these writings can only be realized by those who have read them. An English translation of the Latin translation of the Coptic, which itself is a translation of the Greek, was made by G.R.S. Mead (London, 1896). The Bruce papyrus is of about the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> as the Askew vellum <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codex</a> and contains two treatises:

<ul><li>the two books of Je&ucirc;, the first speculative and <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a>, the second practical, viz., the overcoming of the hostile world powers and the securing of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by the practice of certain <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>: this latter book is styled "Of the Great Logos according to the mystery".
<li>A treatise with unknown title, as the first and last pages are lost. This work is of a purely speculative character and of great antiquity, written between A.D. 150 and 200 in Sethian or <a href="../cathen/01697a.htm">Archontian</a> circles, and containing a reference to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Marsanes, Nikotheus, and Phosilampes.</ul>

<p>No complete English translations of these treatises exist; some passages, however, are translated in the aforesaid G.R.S. Mead's "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten". Both the Bruce and Askew <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codices</a> have been translated into German by C. Schmidt (1892) in "Texte u. Unters" and (1901) in the <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> "Greek Fathers". A Latin translation exists of the "Pistis Sophia" by Schwartze and Petermann (Berlin, 1851) and a French one of the Bruce <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codex</a> by Am&eacute;lineau (Paris, 1890). The Akhmim <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codex</a> of the fifth century, found in 1896, and now in the Egyptian Museum at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, contains

<ul><li>a "Gospel of Mary", called in the subscriptions "An Apocryphon of John": this Gospel must be of the highest antiquity, as <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>, about A.D. 170, made use of it in his description of the Barbelo-Gnostics;
<li>a "Sophia Jesu Christi", containing <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>;
<li>a "Praxis Petri", containing a fantastic relation of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> worked on <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> daughter.</ul>

<p>The study of Gnosticism is seriously retarded by the entirely unaccountable delay in the publication of these treatises; for these thirteen years past we possess only the brief account of this <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codex</a> published in the "Sitzungsber. d. k. preus. Acad." (Berlin, 1896), pp. 839-847.

<p>This account of Gnostic literature would be incomplete without reference to a treatise commonly published amongst the works of <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> and called <a href="../fathers/0802.htm">"Excerpta ex Theodoto"</a>. It consists of a number of Gnostic extracts made by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a> for his own use with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of future refutation; and, with <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement's</a> notes and remarks on the same, form a very confusing anthology. See O. Bibelius, "Studien zur Gesch. der Valent." in "Zeitschr. f. N. Nest. Wiss." (Giessen, 1908).

<p>Oriental non-Christian Gnosticism has left us the sacred books of the <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaeans</a>, viz., <ul><li>the "Genz&acirc; rab&acirc;" or "Great Treasure", a large collection of miscellaneous treatises of different <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, some as late, probably, as the ninth, some as early, perhaps, as the third century. The Genz&acirc; was translated into Latin, by Norberg (Copenhagen, 1817), and the most important treatises into German, by W. Brandt (Leipzig, 1892). <li>Kolasta, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and instructions on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the journey of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, published in <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaean</a> by J. Euting (Stuttgart, 1867). <li>Dr&acirc;sh&ecirc; d'Jahya, a biography of John the Baptist "ab utero useque ad tumulum" &#151; as <a href="../cathen/01057a.htm">Abraham Echellensis</a> puts it &#151; not published.</ul>

<p>Alexandrian non-Christian Gnosticism is perceptible in Trismegistic literature, published in English translation by G.R.S. Mead (London and Benares, 1902, three volumes). Specifically <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> Gnosticism left no literature, but Gnostic speculations have an echo in several <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> works, such as the Book of Enoch, the Zohar, the <a href="../cathen/14435b.htm">Talmudic</a> treatise Chagiga XV. See Gf&ouml;rer, "Philo", Vol. I, and Karppe, "Etudes sur. ore. nat. d. Zohar" (Paris, 1901).
<h2>Refutation of Gnosticism</h2>

<p>From the first Gnosticism met with the most determined opposition from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The last words of the aged <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in his <a href="../bible/1ti000.htm">First Epistle to Timothy</a> are usually taken as referring to Gnosticism, which is described as "Profane novelties of words and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called [<em>antitheseis tes pseudonomou gnoseos</em> &#151; the antitheses of so-called Gnosis] which some professing have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>". Most probably <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> use of the terms <em>pleroma, the &aelig;on of this world, the archon of the power of the air</em>, in <a href="../bible/eph000.htm">Ephesians</a> and <a href="../bible/col000.htm">Colossians</a>, was suggested by the abuse of these terms by the Gnostics. Other allusions to Gnosticism in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are possible, but cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a>, such as <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs9">Titus 3:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs1">1 John 4:1-3</a>.

<p>The first anti-Gnostic writer was <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a> (d. c. 165). His "Syntagma" (<em>Syntagma kata pason ton gegenemenon aireseon</em>), long thought lost, is substantially contained in the "Libellus adv. omn. haeres.", usually attached to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> "De Praescriptione"; such at least is the thesis of J. Kunze (1894) which is largely accepted. Of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin's</a> anti-Gnostic treatise on the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<em>Peri anastaseos</em>) considerable fragments are extant in <a href="../cathen/10243a.htm">Methodius'</a> "Dialogue on the Resurrection" and in <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene's</a> "Sacra Parellela". <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin's</a> "Comendium against Marcion", quoted by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103406.htm">IV.6.2</a> and <a href="../fathers/0103526.htm">V.26.2</a>), is possibly identical with his Syntagma". Immediately after <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, Miltiades, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0314.htm"><em>Against the Valentinians</em> 5</a>, and Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.28</a>) as having combated the Gnostics and especially the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>. His writings are lost. <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a> (d. c. 185) wrote against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Hermogenes, and also an excellent treatise against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> (<em>kata Markionos Logos</em>). The book against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> is probably extant in the "Dialogus de rect&acirc; in Deum fide" of Pseudo-Origen. For Agrippa Castor see <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">BASILIDES</a>.

<p>Hegesippus, a Palestinian, traveled by way of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he arrived under <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> (155-166), to ascertain the sound and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>. He met many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on his way, who all taught the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he made a list of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from Peter to <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>. In consequence he wrote five books of Memoirs (<em>Upomnemata</em>) "in a most simple style, giving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>", becoming "a champion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against the godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>" (Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.7 sqq. and IV.21 sqq.</a>). Of this work only a few fragments remain, and these are historical rather than <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>.

<p>Rhodon, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, Philip, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06654a.htm">Gortyna</a> in Crete, and a certain Modestus wrote against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, but their writings are lost. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103115.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.15.6</a>) and Epiphanius (xxxiv, 11) quote a short poem against the Oriental <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> and the conjuror Marcus by "an aged" but unknown author; and Zachaeus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, is said to have written against the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> and especially Ptolemy.

<p>Beyond all comparison most important is the great anti-Gnostic work of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>, <em>Elegchos kai anatrope tes psudonymou gnoseos</em>, usually called <a href="../fathers/0103.htm">"Adversus Haereses"</a>. It consists of five books, evidently not written at one time; the first three books about A.D. 180; the last two about a dozen years later. The greater part of the first book has come down to us in the original Greek, the rest in a very ancient and anxiously close Latin translation, and some fragments in <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Gnostics from personal intercourse and from their own writings and gives minute descriptions of their systems, especially of the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> and Barbelo-Gnostics. A good test of how <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> employed his Gnostic sources can be made by comparing the newly found "Evangelium Mariae" with <a href="../fathers/0103124.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.24</a>. Numerous attempts to discredit <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> failures (see <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">SAINT IRENAEUS</a>). Besides his great work, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> wrote an open letter to the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Florinus, who thought of joining the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>; and when the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, and had become a Gnostic, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> wrote on his account a treatise "On the Ogdoad", and also a letter to <a href="../cathen/15409a.htm">Pope Victor</a>, begging him to use his authority against him. Only a few passages of these writings are extant.

<p><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23.4</a>) mentions a letter of <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius of Corinth</a> (c. 170) to the <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedians</a>, in which he attacks the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. The letter is not extant. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (d. c. 215) only indirectly combated Gnosticism by defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Gnosis, especially in <a href="../fathers/02091.htm"><em>The Pedagogue</em> I</a>, <a href="../fathers/0210.htm"><em>Stromata</em> II, III, V</a>, and in the so-called eighth book or <a href="../fathers/0802.htm">"Excerpta ex Theodoto"</a>. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> devoted no work exclusively to the refutation of Gnosticism but his four books <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"On First Principles"</a> (<em>Peri archon</em>), written about the year 230, and preserved to us only in some Greek fragments and a free Latin translation by <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a>, is practically a refutation of Gnostic <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05397b.htm">Emanationism</a>.

<p>About the year 300 an unknown <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> author, sometimes <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> identified with <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and often called by the literary pseudonym Adamantius, or "The Man of Steel", wrote a long dialogue of which the title is lost, but which is usually designated by the words, "De rect&acirc; in Deum fide". This dialogue, usually divided into five books, contains discussions with representatives of two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionism</a>, of Valentinianism, and of <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanism</a>. The writer plagiarizes extensively from <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/10243a.htm">Methodius of Olympus</a>, especially the latter's anti-Gnostic dialogue <a href="../fathers/0624.htm">"On Free Will"</a> (<em>Peri tou autexousiou</em>).

<p>The greatest anti-Gnostic controversialist of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (b. 169), who practically devoted his life to combating this dreadful sum of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. We need but mention the titles of his anti-Gnostic works: <a href="../fathers/0311.htm">"De Praescriptione haereticorum"</a>; <a href="../fathers/0312.htm">"Adversus Marcionem"</a>; a book <a href="../fathers/0314.htm">"Adversus Valentinianos"</a>; <a href="../fathers/0318.htm">"Scorpiace"</a>; <a href="../fathers/0315.htm">"De Carne Christi"</a>; <a href="../fathers/0316.htm">"De Resurrectione Carnis"</a>; and finally <a href="../fathers/0317.htm">"Adversus Praxeam"</a>.

<p>A storehouse of information rather than a refutation is the great work of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, written some time after A.D. 234, once called "Philosophoumena" and ascribed to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, but since the discovery of Books IV-X, in 1842, known by the name if its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> author and its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> title, <a href="../fathers/0501.htm">"Refutation of All Heresies"</a> (<em>katapason aireseon elegchos</em>).

<p>The publication of the <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">Codex</a> by E. Miller (Oxford, 1851) revolutionized the study of Gnosticism and rendered works published previous to that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> antiquated and almost worthless. To students of Gnosticism this work is as indispensable as that of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>. There is an English translation by J. MacMahon in "The Ante-Nicene Library" (Edinburgh, 1868). <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> tried to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that all Gnosticism was derived from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; his speculations may be disregarded, but, as he was in possession of a great number of Gnostic writings from which he quotes, his information is priceless. As he wrote nearly fifty years after <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> he had been, he describes a later development of Gnosis than the <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Bishop of Lyons</a>. Besides his greater work, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> wrote, many years previously (before 217), a small compendium against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, giving a list of the same, thirty-two in number, from <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> to Noetus; also a treatise against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>.

<p>As, from the beginning of the fourth century, Gnosticism was in rapid decline, there was less need of champions of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, hence there is a long interval between Adamantius's dialogue and St. Epiphanius's "Panarion", begun in the year 374. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, who is his youth was brought into closest contact with Gnostic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and especially the Phibionists, and perhaps even, as some hold, belonged to this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> himself, is still a first-class authority. With marvelous industry he gathered information on all sides, but his injudicious and too credulous acceptance of many details can hardly be excused.

<p><a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius of Brescia</a>, a few years later (383), gave to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> what <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> had given to the Greek. He counted and described no fewer than one hundred and twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, but took the word in a somewhat wide and vague sense. Though dependent on the "Syntagma" of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, his account is entirely independent of that of Epiphanius.

<p>Another Latin writer, who probably lived in the middle of the fifth century in Southern Gaul, and who is probably identical with <a href="../cathen/01746c.htm">Arnobius the Younger</a>, left a work, commonly called "Praedestinatus", consisting of three books, in the first of which he describes ninety <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> from <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> to the Praedestinationists. This work unfortunately contains many <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> and fabulous statements. Some time after the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a> wrote a "Compendium of Heretical Fables" which is of considerable value for the history of Gnosticism, because it gives in a very concise and objective way the history of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> since the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> book "De Haeresibus" (written about 428) is too dependent on <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a> and Epiphanius to be of much value. Amongst anti-Gnostic writers we must finally mention the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a> Plotinus (d. A.D. 270), who wrote a treatise "Against the Gnostics". These were evidently scholars who frequented his <em>collegia</em>, but whose Oriental and fantastic <a href="../cathen/11740b.htm">pessimism</a> was irreconcilable with Plotinus's views.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The attempt to picture Gnosticism as a mighty movement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> towards the noblest and highest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a movement in some way parallel to that of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, has completely failed. It has been abandoned by recent unprejudiced scholars such as W. Bousset and O. Gruppe, and it is to be regretted that it should have been renewed by an English writer, G.R.S. Mead, in "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten", an unscholarly and misleading work, which in English-speaking countries may retard the sober and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> appreciation of Gnosticism as it was in historical fact.

<p>Gnosticism was not an advance, it was a retrogression. It was born amidst the last throes of expiring cults and civilizations in Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Though hellenized, these countries remained Oriental and <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> to the core. This Oriental spirit &#151; Attis of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, Istar of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, Isis of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrological</a> and <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> lore of the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> world &#151; first sore beset by <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahuramazda</a> in the East, and then overwhelmed by the Divine greatness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the West, called a truce by the fusion of both Parseeism and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with itself. It tried to do for the East what <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a> tried to do for the West. During at least two centuries it was a real danger to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, though not so great as some modern writers would make us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as if the merest breath might have changed the fortunes of Gnostic, as against <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>Similar things are said of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithraism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> as against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Jesus Christ</a>. But these sayings have more piquancy than objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> survived, and not Gnosticism, because the former was the fittest &#151; immeasurably, nay <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, so. Gnosticism died not by chance, but because it lacked vital power within itself; and no amount of <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophistic</a> literature, flooding English and German markets, can give life to that which perished from intrinsic and essential defects.

<p>It is striking that the two earliest champions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against Gnosticism &#151; Hegesippus and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> &#151; brought out so clearly the method of warfare which alone was possible, but which also alone sufficed to secure the victory in the conflict, a method which <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> some years later scientifically explained in his "De Praescriptione". Both Hegesippus and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Gnostic doctrines did not belong to that deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was taught by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">succession</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the primary <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; both in triumphant conclusion drew up a list of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishops of Rome</a>, from Peter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a> of their day; as Gnosticism was not taught by that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> everywhere must agree, it stood self-condemned.

<p>A just verdict on the Gnostics is that of O. Gruppe (Ausf&uuml;hrungen, p. 162); the circumstances of the period gave them a certain importance. But a living force they never were, either in general history or in the history of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Gnosticism deserves attention as showing what mention dispositions <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> found in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, what obstacles it had to overcome to maintain its own life; but "means of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> progress it never was".
