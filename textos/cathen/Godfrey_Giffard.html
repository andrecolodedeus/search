<h1>Godfrey Giffard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, b. about 1235; d. 26 Jan., 1301. He was the son of Hugh Giffard of Boyton in Wiltshire, and Sybil, the daughter and coheiress of Walter de Cormeilles. His elder brother Walter became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> (d. 1279). During the earlier part of his life his success was bound up with that of his brother. When in May, 1264, Walter was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>, Godfrey became canon and subsequently <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Wells; he also held many other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, although only in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and, as his enemies alleged, not learned. When in August, 1265, Walter became chancellor, Godfrey in 1266 was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, with leave to appoint a substitute to act during his absence; and when in October, 1266, Walter was translated to <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Godfrey succeeded him as Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and received further <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> from the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, becoming <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of York and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Adlingfleet in 1267. When Bishop Nicholas of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> was translated from the <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">See of Worcester</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, Godfrey was elected by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; he received the temporalities of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in June, 1268. One of his first acts as bishop-elect was to obtain licence to continue the work, begun by Walter Cantelupe, of building and fortifying Hartlebury Castle, which has ever since been the principal palace of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, 23 Sept., 1268, and his <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronement</a> 25 December. During his chancellorship a parliament was held at Marlbridge (52. H. 3) where many useful <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed for restraining the abuse of distresses, regulating the incidence of tenure, and improving civil and criminal procedure; the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> they display is remarkable, and if he did not frame them himself, he deserves credit for having had the wit to employ the superior men who did. He continued in office as chancellor until 28 Oct., 1269, when he handed over the seal to the king.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Giffard devoted himself to the care of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which he ruled for nearly thirty-four years. In the course of those years two affairs caused him considerable trouble: the disputes with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and that with Malvern Priory. The <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> feud lasted down to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death, and reached such a height that when, in 1300, Archbishop Winchelsey visited the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> presented a formal accusation against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> containing thirty-six articles of varying importance to which Giffard's satisfactory answers are still extant. The quarrel appears to date from 1288 when the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> considered that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> had been infringed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> refusal to allow their <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> to summon those who were to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> at Westbury. The feeling aroused was intensified by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> attempt, in 1288, to annex the churches in his gift to the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> in the church of Westbury. This was eventually decided in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> favour in the <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">Arches Court</a> in 1297. Relations were, moreover, strained because of the unwillingness of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> to admit the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> visitations. The difficulty with the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Great Malvern was even more complicated. The cause was a claim made by the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> to be independent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Westminster. The relations between the two houses had been settled in 1217. Giffard's predecessors had had continual trouble with the same <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. The present struggle with Richard of Ware, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Westminster lasted from 1279 until 1283 and was not really ended then. The climax was reached in September, 1282, when Giffard, as visitor, at the request of some of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, deposed the unworthy prior, William of Ledbury. A violent conflict followed, full of incidents, appeals, and counter-appeals and finally the king had to intervene to bring about a compromise.

<p>Besides building the castle at Hartlebury, and rebuilding the church there, Giffard built magnificent mansions at Wick and Alvechurch. Moreover he ornamented the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with the small columns of marble having joints of gilded brass, which form one of the most graceful characteristics of the present choir and Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Even after retiring from the chancellorship he is still found exercising judicial functions, as when, in 1272, with Roger Mortimer he enquired into the injuries done by the townspeople of Oxford to the scholars; and, in 1278, he was at the head of the justices itinerant for the counties of Hereford, Hertford, and Kent. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on 4 Feb. in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> (Ann. Monast., IV, 551).
