<h1>Godfrey Goodman</h1>  

<p>Born at Ruthin, Denbighshire, 28 February, 1582-3; died at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, 19 January, 1656. He was <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gloucester, and passed all his public life in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>. His religious sympathies, however, inclined him to the old Faith, and when misfortune and ruin overtook him, late in life, he entered its fold. He was the son of Godfrey Goodman and his wife, Jane Croxton, landed gentry living in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. In 1593 he was sent to Westminster School, where he remained seven years under the protection of his uncle, Gabriel Goodman, Dean of Westminster. He was an earnest student and when only seventeen won a scholarship in Trinity College Cambridge. He graduated there in 1604 and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at Bangor, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, shortly after. His first appointment was to the rectory of Stapleford Abbots, Essex, in 1606. From this time <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> and lucrative emoluments fell rapidly to his share. He was made successively <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> of Westminster 1607, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of West Isley, Berks, 1616, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Kinnerton, Gloucester, canon of <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a>, 1617, Dean of Rochester, 1620-1, and finally <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gloucester, 1694-5. In addition he held two livings in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, at Llandyssil and Llanarmon. Even when he was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he was allowed to retain most of these appointments. He became one of the Court preachers and was <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Queen Anne, wife of James I. His leaning towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> made enemies for him at <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a> and he was reprimanded by the King on Court sermons. A few years later he was severely blamed for having erected a crucifix at <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a> and used altar-cloths worked with a cross in his own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Gloucester, and further for having suspended a minister who insisted on preaching "that all who die papists go inevitably to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>." It is likely that at this time <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> were arising in his mind about the legitimacy of the separation from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and he sought the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were in hiding throughout the country. He was frequently at variance with Archbishop Laud, and in 1640 refused on conscientious grounds to sign the seventeen Articles drawn up by him. He was thereupon arrested, but after five weeks in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> he overcame his scruples. This, however, availed him little, as he was soon impeached by Parliament along with Laud and the ten other signatories of the Articles and was sent to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for four months. In 1643 his episcopal palace was pillaged by the parliamentarian soldiers and in a year or two he was stripped of all his emoluments. He withdrew now from public life to his small <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> estate in Carnarvon. It was at this time too, most likely, that he was converted. About 1650 he came to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and gave himself up to study and research; he was befriended by some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> royalists and lived in close connection with them till his death in 1656. Father Davenport, O.S.F., former <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Queen Henrietta, was his confessor and attended him in his last illness. By his will, in which he made a profession of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, he left most of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to Ruthin his native town; his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and books, however, were given to Trinity College, Cambridge. His contemporaries describe him as being a hospitable, quiet man, and lavish in his charity to the poor.

<p>His principal works are: (1) "The Fall of Man, or the Corruption of Nature proved by the light of his Natural Reason" (1616); (2) An account of his sufferings, 1650, (3) "The two mysteries of the Christian Religion, the Trinity and the lncarnation, explicated" (1653); (4) "Arguments and animadversions on Dr. George Hakewil's Apology", (5) "The Creatures praying God" (1622); (6) "The Court of King James the First by Sir A.W. reviewed".
