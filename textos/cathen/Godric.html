<h1>Godric</h1>  

<p>The name of two Abbots of Croyland.
<h2>Godric I (870-941)</h2>

<p>Godrick I was the successor of the Abbot Theodore, who had been slain by the Danes. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> had sacked and destroyed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrating</a> the shrines and driving out the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. On their return they unanimously elected Godric <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, in spite of his reluctance. Soon after his election, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Ancarig, Godric went with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to clear away the ruins of Medehamsted Abbey (Peterborough), to bury the corpses of its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and eighty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, whom the Danes had <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, and to erect a memorial near their grave. Evil times fell on <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a> during his abbacy. Beorred, King of Mercia, under pretext of driving out the Danes, seized the lands and possessions of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his dominions, among which was <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a>. Beorred died in 874, and was succeeded by one of his servants, Ceowulf, who demanded a thousand pounds from the <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Abbey of Croyland</a>, and reduced it to such poverty, that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were forced to sell nearly all their plate. So poor did the house become that none would join it, and, at Godric's death in 941, only five of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were left.
<h2>Godric II (1005-18)</h2>

<p>Godric II was no less unfortunate than his namesake. King Ethelred the Redeless first exacted from it large sums of money, and in the fourth year of Godric's rule the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> jarl, Turkil, arrived with a fleet, demanded a ransom, and ravaged the manors of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1013 the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> king, Sweyn, devastated the neighbouring country. <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a>, which was luckily isolated by floods, became the refuge of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and layfolk, whose support was a heavy burden on the resources of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Sweyn extorted two large ransoms within three months, while the king's officers threatened to complete its ruin because it supported the Danes. In despair Godric and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> engaged as protector Leofwin, brother of Leofric, Earl of Leicester, who, in return for a grant of lands, protected them till his death in 1017. The same year the accession of Cnut brought peace to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and some relief to <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croyland</a>. Godric was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.
