<h1>Gondulphus</h1>  

<p>(GUNDULFUS).

<p>The name of three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of whom one was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tongres (Maestricht), the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, while the third is known as Gondulphus of Berry. We possess little information concerning any of the three, and the slight <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of each afforded us by the documents of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> is reduced to the following.
<h2 id="section1">Gondulphus of Metz</h2>

<p>Gondulphus of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> is the one concerning whom our information is most reliable. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 6 September. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Gondulphus succeeded Angilram, him who caused <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a> to write the "Liber de episcopis Mettensibus", and who died probably in 791. At the death of Angilram there was a vacancy in the episcopal <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">See of Metz</a>, which was terminated by the accession of Gondulphus. The "Annales S. Vincentii Mettenses" give the date as 819. But, as it is known, on the other hand, that since the time of Bishop Chrodegang episcopal <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> took place on Sunday, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop Gondulphus must be set down as 28 (?) December, 816. The old episcopal catalogue of the church of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> informs us that Gondulphus occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of this church for six years, eight months, and seven days, and that he died on the 7th of the Ides of September, which would be the sixth of that month, in the year 823. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gorze, where his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are still <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> on 6 September. It is impossible to quote in this respect any special patronage, and with regard to his episcopal career, apart from the details furnished here, there exists no information.
<h2 id="section2">Gondulphus of Tongres</h2>

<p>Or, as he is commonly called "Gondulphus of Maastricht" because his predecessor, Bishop Monulphus, transferred the seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> from Tongres to Maastricht, which thenceforth was the actual residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tongres. However, the official title of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tongres, <em>episcopus Tungrorum</em>, was retained until the eleventh century, even when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> had been transferred from Maastricht to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>.

<p>Bishop Gondulphus is a somewhat enigmatic figure indeed, one is inclined to question whether he be not identical with Monulphus. But the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> must nevertheless be distinguished. Monulphus must have occupied the See of Tongres until the end of the sixth or the beginning of the seventh century, while at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 614 the presence is discovered of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maastricht named Betulphus. Gondulphus, then, probably comes between Monulphus and Betulphus, at least if this Betulphus must not be identified with Gondulphus on the grounds that the case is analogous to that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where Bertulfus and Crotoldus must be reckoned identical. Furthermore, the episcopal lists of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, whose value is, however, not very great, ignore Betulphus, and make Gondulphus the immediate successor of Monulphus. The biographies of Gondulphus, which are handed down to us from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, are merely an extract from the "Vita Servatii" of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Jocundus. They are quite without value and are full of legends. If they are to be believed, Gondulphus endeavoured to rebuild the town of Tongres, which had been destroyed by the barbarian invasions. But <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> opposed his scheme, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> manifested its desire to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. Furious wolves fell upon the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> colonists of this region, and devoured them before the eyes of the horrified <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Thus has legend quite obscured the authentic history of St. Gondulphus, the fact of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> at Maastricht being the only one that is authentic. According to local tradition he occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> for seven years and died about 607. This last statement does not tally with his presence at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 614, if he is to be considered identical with the Betulphus who assisted at that council. In any case he was buried in the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church of Saint-Servais at Maastricht, which had been magnificently restored by his predecessor, St. Monulphus.

<p>The bodies of Monulphus and Gondulphus were solemnly exhumed in 1039 by the Bishops Nithard of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> and G&eacute;rard of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. An epitaph commemorating this event was afterwards misinterpreted, and gave rise to a legend according to which the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> arose from their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in 1039 in order to assist at the dedication of the church of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (Aix-la-Chapelle), and at the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> returned to their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> to resume their eternal sleep. Together with St. Monulphus, St. Gondulphus is secondary patron of the city and church of Maastricht. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 16 July. The commemoration of the exhumation of 1039 is celebrated on to August.
<h2 id="section3">St. Gondulphus (or Gondon) of Berry</h2>

<p>St. Gondulphus of Berry, who is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of whom history gives a still more legendary account than of his namesake of Maastricht. According to the biography in which he is comparatively lately treated by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Berry, he was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in the seventh century. Not succeeding in appeasing the troubles which had arisen in his church, he resolved to submit to the inevitable, and retired to Berry with a number of his disciples. It is not known, however, that any <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> had to deal with these conditions. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it has been thought that Gondulphus lived at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> regarding the affair of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, that he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 555, but that he was never received as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. These are merely hypotheses and in fact it must be said that the history of the St. Gondulphus who is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in Berry is unknown.

<p>The attestation of his cult in Berry appears late among the additions to the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Usuard; it is cited in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> in 1625. He is the patron of St-Gondon, near Gien. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 17 June.
