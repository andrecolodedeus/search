<h1>Gortyna</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, of the Island of Crete. The city, situated at the foot of Mount Ida, not far from the River Lethe, was first called Larissa, afterwards Cremnia, then Gortys, and finally Gortyna. Homer mentions it as a fortified city, which gives an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of its great antiquity. Previous to the Roman occupation it was continually at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the two neighbouring and rival cities of Cnossus and Cydonia, contending with them for supremacy. The result was desolation in an island predestined to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by its geographical position, climate, and soil. The Cretans, indeed, were ever the cause of their own distress, being at all times discontented with their government. Under Roman rule Gortyna became the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the island, which then prospered in a degree hitherto unknown. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Titus, the disciple to whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> addressed one of his Epistles. A basilica dedicated to St. Titus, discovered at Gortyna partly in ruins, dates from the fifth, perhaps from the fourth, century. Among the earliest occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were St. Philip, a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept 11 April; St. Myron, commemorated 8 August; St. Cyril, 9 July; St. Eumenius, 18 September, St. Peter the Younger, 14 July. In 170 St. Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, addressed a letter to the community of Gortyna (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23</a>), then probably the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of Crete. Among its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> mention should also be made of <a href="../cathen/01473b.htm">St. Andrew of Crete</a> (d. 740), a famous Byzantine poet and orator, and opponent of the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>. In 825 the island was taken by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, Archbishop Cyril was slain for refusing to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, and Gortyna so completely destroyed that it never rose from its ruins. Thenceforth, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> ceased to bear the title of Gortyna, took that of Crete, and resided elsewhere, probably at <a href="../cathen/03244d.htm">Candia</a>, a city built by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and made capital of the island. In the tenth century Nicephorus Phocas reconquered Crete for the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, which held it until 1204, when it fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, who retained the island until 1669, when the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> took possession of it. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> did not allow the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to reside in Crete, while the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> bore the title of <a href="../cathen/03244d.htm">Candia</a>, not of Gortyna. Even yet the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> retains the name of <a href="../cathen/03244d.htm">Candia</a>, Gortyna being a titular <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> title. On the other hand the Greek <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Gortyna calls himself <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Crete. The extensive ruins of Gortyna are located near the village of Hagioi Deka. Among them are a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Apollo, several <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, the basilica of St. Titus, and numerous inscriptions, among which is the text of the so-called Laws of Gortyna, found in 1884, which afford us a good insight into Greek law of the fifth century B.C. &AElig;sculapius was much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> at Gortyna. Within an hour's distance of the ruins is an immense grotto, by many archaeologists considered identical with the famous <a href="../cathen/08728b.htm">labyrinth</a>. It is, however, only an ancient quarry out of which Gortyna was built; the <a href="../cathen/08728b.htm">labyrinth</a> was situated near Cnossus.
