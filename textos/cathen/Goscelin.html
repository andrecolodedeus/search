<h1>Goscelin</h1>  

<p>(Or GOTSELIN, according to the spelling in the earliest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of his works.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> biographical writer; died about 1099. He was born in the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/02522b.htm">St. Bertin's</a> at Omer. Hermann, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, brought him to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his doing so is disputed. Wright gives 1058, on the authority of <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, but Goscelin himself states that he accompanied Hermann to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1049, shortly before the great Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in that year, and as that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1053, it seems likely that Goscelin came with him then. He remained in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to the end of his life, visiting many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, and collecting, wherever he went, materials for his numerous biographies of English <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> praises his industry in the highest terms. He was at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> about 1082, where he wrote a life of <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda</a>. Between 1087 and 1092 he was at <a href="../cathen/12638a.htm">Ramsey</a>, and compiled there a life of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">St. Ivo, or Ives</a>. In 1098 he went to <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, where he wrote his account of the translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Augustine and his companions, which had taken place in 1091. This he dedicated to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, and it was probably his last work. The Canterbury Obituary, quoted by Wharton, gives 15 May as the day of his death but does not name the year. He was certainly alive in the beginning of the year 1099, but we hear nothing of him afterwards. His works consist of the lives of many English <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, chiefly of those connected with Canterbury, where he spent his last years. Some of them have been printed by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. Others are contained in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the British Museum (London) and at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>. A full list of his known writings is given in the eighth volume of the "Histoire litt&eacute;rairede France". His chief work was a life of <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine of Canterbury</a>, professing to be based on older records and divided into two parts, &#151; an "Historia major" (in Mabillon, Acta SS. O.S.B., I) and an "Historia minor" (in Wharton, Anglia Sacra, I). His life of <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">St. Swithin</a> (in <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, Acta SS., July) is also of some importance, but the majority of his writings have not much value at the present day. His method seems to have been usually to take some older writer as his basis and to reproduce his work, in a somewhat inflated style, with additions of his own, but critics are agreed that no very great reliance can be placed on these latter. According to <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, Goscelin was also a skilled musician.
