<h1>Gothic Architecture</h1>  

<p>The term <em>Gothic</em> was first used during the later <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and as a term of contempt. Says <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, "Then arose new architects who after the manner of their barbarous nations erected buildings in that style which we call Gothic", while Evelyn but expresses the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude of his own time when he writes, "The ancient Greek and Roman architecture answered all the perfections required in a faultless and accomplished building" &#151; but the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> and <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> destroyed these and "introduced in their stead a certain fantastical and licentious manner of building: congestions of heavy, dark, melancholy, monkish piles, without any just proportion, use or beauty." For the first time, an attempt was made to destroy an instinctive and, so far as <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was concerned, an almost universal form of art, and to substitute in its place another built up by artificial rules and premeditated theories; it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, therefore, that the ground should be cleared of a once luxuriant growth that still showed signs of vitality, and to effect this the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a>, <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a>, and Wren were compelled to throw scorn on the art they were determined to discredit. As <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> habitat of the style as they were of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> called it the "maniera Tedesca", and since to them the word <em>Goth</em> implied the perfection of barbarism, it is but natural that they should have applied it to a style they desired to destroy. The style ceased, for the particular type of civilization it expressed had come to an end; but the name remained, and when, early in the nineteenth century, the beginnings of a new epoch brought new apologists, the old title was taken over as the only one available, and since then constant efforts have been made to define it more exactly, to give it a new significance, or to substitute in its place a term more expressive of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to be conveyed.

<p>The word itself, in its present application, is repugnant to any sense of exact thought; ethnically, the art so described is immediately Franco-Norman in its origins, and between the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, on the one hand, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Normans. on the other, lies a racial, religious, and chronological gulf. With the conquest of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by Justinian (535-553) "the race and name of <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> perished for ever" (Bryce, "The Holy Roman Empire", III, 29) five centuries before the beginnings of the art that bears their name. Modern scholarship seeks deeper even than racial tendencies for the root impulses of art in any of its forms, and apart from the desirable correction of an historical anachronism it is felt that <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art (of which Gothic architecture is but one category), since it owes its existence to influences and tendencies stronger than those of blood, demands a name that shall be exact and significant, and indicative of the more just estimation in which it now is held.

<p>But little success has followed any of the attempts at definition. The effort has produced such varying results as the epithets of <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> and Evelyn, the nebulous or sentimental paraphrases of the early nineteenth century romanticists, the narrow archeological definitions of De Caumont, and the rigid formalities of the more learned <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logicians</a> and structural specialists, such as MM. Viollet le Duc, Anthyme St-Paul, and Enlart, and Professor Moore. The only scientific attempt is that of which the first was the originator, the last the most scholarly and exact exponent. Concisely stated, the contention of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is that

<blockquote><p>the whole scheme of the building is determined by, and its whole strength is made to reside in a finely organized and frankly confessed framework rather than in walls. This framework, made up of piers, arches and <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">buttresses</a>, is freed from every unnecessary incumbrance of wall and is rendered as light in all its parts as is compatible with strength &#151; the stability of the building depending not upon inert massiveness, except in the outermost abutment of active parts whose opposing forces neutralize each other and produce a perfect equilibrium. It is thus a system of balanced thrusts in contradistinction to the ancient system of inert stability. Gothic architecture is such a system carried out in a finely artistic spirit (Charles H. Moore, "Development and Character of Gothic Architecture", I, 8).</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an admirable statement of the fundamental structural element in Gothic architecture, but, carried away by enthusiasm for the crowning achievement of the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the domain of construction, those who have most clearly demonstrated its pre- eminence have usually fallen into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of declaring this one quality to be the touchstone of Gothic architecture, minimizing the importance of all &aelig;sthetic considerations, and so denying the name of Gothic to everything where the system of balanced thrusts, ribbed vaulting, and concentrated loads did not consistently appear. Even Professor Moore himself says, "Wherever a framework maintained on the principle of thrust and counter-thrust is wanting, we have not Gothic" (Moore, op. cit., I, 8). The result is that all the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> architects of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, with the exception of that produced during the space of a century and a half, and chiefly within the limits of the old Royal Domain of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, is denied the title of Gothic. Of the whole body of English architecture produced between 1066 and 1528 it is said, "The English claim to any share in the original development of Gothic, or to the consideration of the pointed architecture of the Island as properly Gothic at all, must be abandoned" (Moore, op. cit., Preface to first ed., 8), and the same is said of the contemporary architecture of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">Logically</a> applied this rule would exclude also all the timber-roofed churches and the civil and military structures erected in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> contemporaneously with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and (though this point is not pressed) even the west fronts of such admittedly Gothic edifices as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. As one commentator on Gothic architecture has said, "A definition so restricted carries with it its own condemnations" (Francis Bond, "Gothic Architecture in England", I, 10).

<p>A still greater argument against the acceptance of this structural definition lies in the fact that while, as Professor Moore declares, "the Gothic monument, thought wonderful as a structural organism, is even more wonderful as a work of art" (op. cit., V, 190), this great artistic element, which for more than three centuries was predominant throughout the greater part of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, existed quite independently of the supreme structural system, and varies only in minor details of racial bias and of presentation, whether it is found in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> or Normandy, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> or <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, or Great Britain &#151; this, which is in itself the manifestation of the underlying impulses and the actual accomplishments of the era it connotes, is treated as an accessory to a structural evolution, and is left without a name except the perfunctory title of "Pointed", which is even less descriptive than the word <em>Gothic</em> itself.



<p>The structural definition has failed of general acceptance, for the temper of the time is increasingly impatient of materialistic definitions, and there is a demand for broader interpretations that shall take cognizance of underlying impulses rather than of material manifestations. The fact is recognized that around and beyond the structural aspects of Gothic architecture lie other qualities of equal importance and greater comprehensiveness, and, if the word is still to be used in the general sense in which it always has been employed, viz., as denoting the definite <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> expression of certain peoples acting under definite impulses and within definite limitations of time, a completely evolved structural principle cannot be used as the sole test of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, if it excludes the great body of work executed within that period, and which in all other respects has complete uniformity and a consistent significance.

<p>It may be said of Gothic architecture that it is an impulse and a tendency rather than a perfectly rounded accomplishment; aesthetically, it never achieved perfection in any given monument, or group of monuments, nor were its possibilities ever fully worked out except in the category of structural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Here alone, finality was achieved by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>-builders of the Ile-de-France, but this fact cannot give to their work exclusive claim to the name of Gothic. The art of any given time is the expression of certain racial qualifications modified by inheritance, tradition, and environment, and working themselves out under the control of religious and secular impulses. When these elements are sound and vital, combined in the right proportions, and operating for a sufficient length of time, the result is a definite style in some one or more of the arts. Such a style is Gothic architecture, and it is to this style, regarded in its most inclusive aspect, that the term <em>Gothic</em> is applied by general consent, and in this sense the word is used here.

<p>Gothic architecture and Gothic art are the &aelig;sthetic expression of that epoch of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> history when <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> had been extinguished, the traditions of classical civilization destroyed, the hordes of barbarian invaders beaten back, or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> and assimilated; and when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had established itself not only as the sole spiritual power, supreme and almost unquestioned in authority, but also as the arbiter of the destinies of sovereigns and of peoples. During the first five centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been fighting for life, first against a dying imperialism, then against barbarian invasions. The removal of the temporal authority to Constantinople had continued the traditions of civilization where Greek, Roman, and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> elements were fused in a curious alembic one result of which was an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> style that later, and modified by many peoples, was to serve as the foundation-stone of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> architecture of the West. Here, in the meantime, the condition had become one of complete chaos, but the end of the Dark Ages was at hand, and during the entire period of the sixth century events were occurring which could only have issue in the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of the West. The part played in the development of this new civilization by the Order of St. Benedict and by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory the Great</a> cannot be over estimated: through the former the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> became a more living and personal attribute of the people, and began as well to force its way across the frontiers of barbarism, while by its means the long-lost ideals of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and order were in a measure re-established. As for <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, he may almost be considered the foundation-stone of the new epoch. The <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was completed during the four centuries following his death, and largely at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope St. Gregory VII</a> (1073-1085), who freed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from secular dominion. With the twelfth century were to come the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> reformation, the revivifying and purification of the episcopate and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> by the canons regular, the development of the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> founded in the preceding century, the communes, the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>; while the thirteenth century, with the aid of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">St. Louis</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, was to raise to the highest point of achievement the spiritual and material potentialities developed in the immediate past.

<p>This is the epoch of Gothic architecture. As we analyse the agencies that together were to make possible a civilization that could blossom only in some pre-eminent art, we find that they fall into certain definite categories. Ethnically the northern blood of the Lombards, <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Norsemen</a> was to furnish the physical vitality of the new epoch. Political the Holy Roman Empire, the Capetian sovereigns of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and the Dukes of Normandy were to restore that sense of nationality without which creative civilization is impossible, while <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">the papacy</a>, working through the irresistible influence of the monastic orders gave the underlying impulse. Normandy in the eleventh century was simply Cluny in action, and during this period the structural elements in Gothic architecture were brought into being. The twelfth century was that of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, and Augustinians, the former infusing into all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> a religious enthusiasm that clamoured for artistic expression, while by their antagonism to the over-rich art of the elder <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, they turned attention from decoration to plan and form, and construction. The <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> reforms through their own members and the other orders which they brought into being were the mobile and efficient arm of a reforming <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and from the day on which St. Benedict <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">his rule</a>, they became a visible manifestation of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and order. With the thirteenth century, the episcopate and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> joined in the labour of adequately expressing a united and unquestioned religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and we may say, therefore, that the civilization of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> organized and invincible had made it. We may, therefore, with good reason, substitute for the undescriptive title "Gothic" the name "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Style" as being exact and reasonably inclusive.

<p>The beginnings of the art that signalized the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> are to be found in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. Certain elements may be traced back to the Carolingian builders, the Lombards in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> and Syrians of the fourth century, and so to the Greeks of Byzantium. They are but elements however, germs that did not develop until infused with the red blood of the Norsemen and quickened by the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform. The style developed in Normandy during the eleventh century contained the major part of these elemental norms, which were to be still further fused and co-ordinated by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, raised to final perfection, and transfigured by a spirit which was that of the entire <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> world. Marvellous as was this achievement, that of the Normans was even more remarkable, for in the style they handed on to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> was inherent every essential potentiality. At this moment Normandy was the focus of northern vitality and almost, for the moment, the religious centre of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The founding of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was very like a mania and the result a remarkable revival of learning; the Abbeys of Bec, F&eacute;camps, and Jumi&egrave;ges became famous throughout all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, drawing to themselves students from every part of the continent; even Cluny herself had in this to take second place. It was a very vigorous and a very widespread civilization, and <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> expression became imperative. Convinced that</p>

<blockquote><p>she was playing a part and a leading part in the civilization of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> . . . Normandy perceived and imitated the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> progress of nations even far removed from her own borders. At this time there was no other country in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> that for <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> attainment could compare with <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Therefore it was to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> that the Normans turned for inspiration for their own buildings. They adopted what was vital in the Lombard style, combined this with what they had already learned from their French neighbours, and added besides a large element of their own national character (Arthur Kingsley Porter, "Mediaeval Architecture", VI, 243, 244).</p></blockquote>

<p>What are these elements which were borrowed from the Lombards and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and which were to form the foundations of Gothic architecture? They are, from the former:<ul> <li>the compound pier and archivolt, <li>the alternate system, and <li>the ribbed and domed vault. </ul> From the latter (i.e. from the Carolingian remains): <ul> <li>the modified basilican plan with its triple <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> crossed by a projecting <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, and its three <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apses</a>. This, the basis of the typical Norman and Gothic plan, was derived directly from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Nativity at <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of which is unknown. It may have been built by Constantine, or by <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a>, or at any date between. In any case it is not earlier than A.D. 300, nor later than 550; <li>the doubled western towers, <li>the <a href="../cathen/08793b.htm">lantern</a> or central tower over the crossing, and <li>the threefold interior system of arcade, triforium, and clerestory. </ul> It will be seen that the main dispositions of the Gothic plan are derived from Carolingian developments of Byzantine modifications of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, itself but an adaptation of that of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; from the Lombards, however, had been acquired three elements which were to lie at the base of Gothic construction. Many of the most characteristic features of Byzantine, Carolingian, and Lombard architecture had been permanently rejected, showing that the process followed was not one of slavish imitation but rather of conscious selection; the vast possibilities inherent in others had not been appreciated, as for instance the polygonal, domed motive of San Vitale and <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> surrounded by its vaulted <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> were to evolve the Gothic chevet, while the pointed arch the Normans never used, though they must have known of, or imagined, its existence.

<p>The actual steps in the development of what may be called the Gothic order, from the primitive basilica to the full perfection of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, fortunately exist, and we may trace the progress year by year and at the hands of diverse peoples. By the beginning of the tenth century, the available supply of ancient columns having become exhausted, square piers built up of small stones had everywhere taken the place of circular monolithic shafts, but the old basilican system remained intact (except in the polygonal, Carolingian churches), arcades supporting roof-bearing walls pierced by narrow windows, and an enclosing wall independent in its construction and forming <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> covered by lean-to roofs of wood. In Sant' Eustorgio at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (c. 900) we find evidences that transverse arches were thrown from each pier of the arcade to the aisle wall, so necessitating the addition of a flat pilaster to each pier to take the spring of the arch. These arches may have been evolved for the purpose of strengthening the fabric, or for ornamental reasons, or in imitation of similar arches in the Carolingian domical churches; but whatever their source the fact remains that they form the first structural step towards the evolution of the Gothic system of construction. Next, transverse arches were thrown across the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, the first recorded example being the church of SS. Felice e Fortunato at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 985. Neither for structural nor &aelig;sthetic reasons was it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that these <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> arches should spring from every pier, so every alternate pier was chosen, the intermediate transverse aisle arch being suppressed and the pier, that no longer had a lateral arch to support, reduced in size. To support the great <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> arches, pilasters were of course attached to the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> face of the pier, and these, as well as the aisle pilasters, were made semicircular in plan. If we assume, as we may, that in other examples all the transverse arches of the aisle were retained, while only each alternate pier bore a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> arch, we shall have a plan made up of compound piers supporting longitudinal and transverse wall-bearing arches that divide the entire area into squares, large and small, the great square often being four times the area of each aisle square.

<p>The next step for a people on the highway of progress would be the vaulting, in masonry, of these squares, for the wooden roofs were inflammable; moreover the Carolingian builders had constantly so vaulted their smaller square roof areas. The process began at once, and of course with the aisle squares, where the structural problem was simplest. The date is not recorded; no early examples remain in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, but in Normandy we find, about 1050, churches which possess <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> covered by square, groined vaults, with the transverse arches showing. The next step was of course the vaulting of the great squares of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, but before this was attempted the rib vault was devised, and the task rendered structurally more simple. The old transverse aisle arches had given the hint; where an aisle so spanned was to be vaulted, the arches already in place formed a very convenient shelf on which some of the vault stones might rest, and, by so much, a portion of the temporary centering might be dispensed with. Intelligence could not fail to suggest that an expedient useful in the case of the transverse arch might be equally useful in that of the diagonals, which were far more difficult of construction, as well the most liable to give way in the case of ribless, groined vaults. When did this era-making invention take place, and at the hands of what people? Where, we shall probably never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, nor yet the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; but it could not have been earlier than 1025, nor later than 1075. San Flaviano at <a href="../cathen/10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a>, authentically <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1032, has <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> with rib vaults which are original and, if so, are the earliest on record, while the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> vault of Sant' Ambrogio at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (c.1060) is of fully developed rib construction. "The most rent authorities (such as Venturi, Storia dell' Arte Italiana, 1903, who cites Stiehl, 1898) accept the view hat the vaults are of foreign fashion derived from <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and were about contemporaneous with the campanile [1129] . . . . It seems that on the evidence we are compelled to suppose that Sant' Ambrogio derived its scheme of construction from <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. It may be that the origin of the vault is to be sought for even in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; but there are many reasons for thinking that the seed <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, like so many others, came from the East." (W. R. Lethaby, "Mediaeval Art", IV, 100-111.)

<p>In all probability the Lombards are the originators of this device so pregnant of future possibilities. The new vault, groined, ribbed, and domed, was in a class by itself, apart from anything that had gone before. Particularly did it differ from the Roman vault in that, while the latter had a level crown, obtained by using semicircular lateral and transverse arches and elliptical groin arches (naturally formed by the intersection of two semicircular barrel vaults of equal radius), the "Lombard" vault was constructed with semicircular diagonals, the result being that domical form which was always retained by the Gothic builders of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> because of its intrinsic beauty. Finally, the new diagonals suggested new vertical supports in the angles of the pier, and so we obtain the fully developed compound pier, which later, at the hands of the English, was to be carried to such extremes of beauty, and to form a potent factor in the development of the Gothic structural system.

<p>The last step in the working-out of the Gothic vaulting plan remained to be taken - the substitution of oblong for square vaulting areas. This was finally accomplished in the Ile-de-France after various Norman experiments, the evidences of which remain in the vaults of St-Georges de Bocherville and the two great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Caen. The sexpartite vaulting of the latter, together with that of the five other similarly vaulted Norman churches and of the choir of St-Denis at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, has always been an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> puzzle, since it is manifestly a stage in the development of the oblong quadripartite vault, and yet is found in these cases some years after the latter system is known to have been fully understood in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and nearly three-quarters of a century later than the vault of Sant' Ambrogio. There is reason to suppose that it is a revival of some of the earlier experiments in the development of the large, oblong, high vault from the small, square, aisle vault. It is conceivable that sexpartite vaults may once have existed in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and before the quadripartite vault was evolved; this would explain the persistence in Sant' Ambrogio of the vaulting shafts on the intermediate piers, for which no apparent reason exists. The vault of the Abbaye aux Dames may be considered either as a ribbed quadripartite vault of square plan, bisected and strengthened by a transverse arch with solid spandrels, or as a series of transverse arches, one on each pair of <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> piers, with the roof spaces filled in by curved surfaces of stone supported on diagonal ribs meeting on the crown of each alternate transverse arch. In the first case would be indicated a fear to trust the stability of so large a quadripartite vault, until experiment <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its efficiency; in the second, a stage in the evolution of the great Sant' Ambrogio vault, all local evidence of which has been lost. The vault of the Abbaye aux Hommes is one more stage in the development; here the vault spaces are curved both from the transverse arch and from the intermediate arch, which so becomes, not an arch &#151; as in the Abbaye aux Dames &#151; but a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vaulting rib. The result is a very strong vaulting system, particularly effective in its light and shade and its line composition, and it does not seem surprising that the Norman builders should have reverted to it from time to time, or that <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Abbot Suger</a> himself should have borrowed it for his fine new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, choosing it for its strength or its beauty in place of the simpler and more open quadripartite vault.

<p>In the meantime the second great structural problem, that of the abutment of the vault thrusts, had been solved by the Normans. In Roman construction the thrust of barrel vaults had been neutralized by walls of great thickness, that of groin vaults either by the same clumsy expedient or by transverse walls; when the Lombards first threw their transverse arches across narrow <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, they added shallow exterior pilaster-strips at the point of contact, rather it would seem for decorative than for structural reasons, as the walls already were strong enough to take the slight thrust of the small arches. With the vaulting of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> the problem became serious; in Sant' Ambrogio they dared not raise the spring of the high vault above the triforium floor, and the thrust of the vault was taken by two massive arches spanning the <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, one below this floor, the other above, the latter being hidden under the wide, sloping roof of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> which was continued unbroken to the aisle walls. This was, of course, but the transverse wall of the Romans, pierced by arched openings; the result was unbeautiful, and the task fell to the Normans of devising a better and more scientific method. At their hands the Lombard pilaster-strip became at once a functional <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">buttress</a> instead of a decorative adjunct, while the successive steps in the evolution of the <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttress</a> remain on record and are peculiarly interesting. In the Abbaye aux Hommes,<blockquote>

<p>the expedient was adopted of constructing half-barrel vaults springing from the aisle walls and abutting against the vaults of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> beneath the lean-to roof. These were in reality concealed <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttresses</a>, but they were <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttresses</a> of bad form; for only a small part of their action met the concentrated action of the vaults that they were designed to stay, the greater part of it operating against the walls between the piers where no abutments were required (Moore, op. cit., I, 12, 13).</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Abbaye aux Dames these defects were remedied, for all the barrel vault was cut away except that narrow part which abutted against, the spring of the vault. The <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttress</a> had been invented. As yet it was hidden under the triforium roof and did not declare itself to the eye. but functionally it was complete.

<p>The fruit of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform working on Norman blood had been the evolution of the main lines of the Gothic plan (barring the eastern termination, or chevet) together with the development of the Gothic system of vaulting and the Gothic principle of concentrated thrusts met by pier <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">buttresses</a> and <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttresses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> "Gothic system" is therefore the product of <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. In the meantime what had been done towards the working-out of the other half of the Gothic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> &#151; the discovering anew of the underlying principles of pure beauty, their analysis into the elements of form and composition, proportion, relation and rhythm, line and colour, and chiaroscuro and finally what had been accomplished in the direction of evolving that new quality of form-expression which, differing as it does from any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the past, gives to Gothic art its peculiar <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>? &#151; Nothing, so far as Normandy is concerned, except as regards certain large architectonic qualities first revealed in Jumi&egrave;ges, and, following this, in the Abbeys of Caen and St-Georges de Bocherville. The Abbaye aux Hommes is the norm of all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>; the Abbaye aux Dames, of the English order; while Jumi&egrave;ges, the first in date, remains one of the most astonishing buildings in history. If it had antecedents, if it came as the culmination of a long and progressive series of experiments in the development of architectonic form, the evidence is forever lost, for, as it now stands, it is isolated, almost preternatural. So far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, it had no precursors, and yet here are the majestical ruins of a monastic church larger than any since the time of Constantine and far in advance, so far as design and development are concerned, of any contemporary structure. Montier en Der, an abbey of Haute-Marne, built by Abbots <a href="../cathen/01161c.htm">Adso</a> and B&eacute;renger (960, 998), is the only recorded structure which bears the least kinship to Jumi&egrave;ges, and the difference between the two separated by only fifty years &#151; is that between barbarism and civilization. All that was good in Lombard architecture has been assimilated, and in addition we find fixed for the whole Gothic period those lofty and monumental proportions, that masterly setting out of plan, the powerful grouping of lofty towers, the final organism of arcaded triforium, and clerestory that together were to set the type of Gothic architecture for its entire term and endure unchanged, though <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfected, so long as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> remained operative. After Jumi&egrave;ges the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Caen were easy, and, given a continuation of cultural conditions, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> and Lincoln inevitable.

<p>During the latter half of the eleventh century these cultural conditions ceased in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. After the death of William the Conqueror the duchy fell on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> times, and the working out to its <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and supreme conclusion of the great style fell into other hands, viz., those of the French of the old Royal Domain and of the transplanted Normans in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the eleventh century had been marked by royal inefficiency, unchecked <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tyranny, episcopal insubordination to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> control, indifference to the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform, and general <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. By the middle of the century Cluny had done its immediate work and had begun to lapse from its lofty ideals, but others were to take its place and do its work, and in 1075 <a href="../cathen/13097d.htm">St. Robert of Molesme</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> the first house of that <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> which was to play in the twelfth century the part that Cluny had played in the eleventh. The preliminary fight that was to clear the ground in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> began with the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> called by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> (1049-1054), when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> and the monastic orders made common cause against the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, secularism, and independence of the French episcopate. The contest was carried on simultaneously with the even greater fight against the empire, and, as there, the victory remained with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. With the close of the eleventh century conditions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had become such that the torch that fell from the hands of the decadent Norman could be caught by the crescent <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a> and carried on without a pause.

<p>During the first half of the twelfth century the outburst of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> vigour in the Ile-de-France is very remarkable. <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and Beauvais became simultaneously centres of activity, and the rib vault makes its appearance at the same time in many places.<blockquote>

<p>During the first phase of the transition, 1100-40, the builders struggled to master the rib vault in its simpler problems: they learned to construct it on square and on oblong plans and even over the awkward curves of <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, but their experiments were always on a small scale. During the second phase (1140-80) the problem of vaulting great <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> was attacked; the evolution centres in the peculiar development which the genius of the French builders gave to the concealed <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttress</a> and to the sexpartite vault, both borrowed from <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> (Porter, op. cit., II, 54).</p></blockquote>

<p>The semicircular <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> of Morienval (c. 1122), with its vaulting supported on ribs curved in plan, and the church of St-Etienne at <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a> (c. 1130), of which Professor Moore says that with the exception of St-Louis of Poissy it is "the only Romanesque structure extant on the soil of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that was unmistakably designed for ribbed, groined vaulting over both nave and aisles", are valuable landmarks in the development. The second task of the French builders was simplified by the introduction of the pointed arch. As in the case of the ribbed vault, there is no means of knowing the exact source from whence this was derived. It had been in use in the East for nearly a thousand years before it appeared in the West; it was established in the South <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as an effective and economical contour for barrel vaults by the year 1050, whence it migrated to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and so to Berry (where it appears in 1110), but always in connection with vaults rather than arches. The earliest structural pointed arch recorded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> of Morienval, referred to above, and is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1122.

<p>This form, so pregnant of structural and artistic possibilities, may have been brought from the Holy Land by returning <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, or it may have been independently evolved. Whatever its source, its advantages were so great from a practical standpoint that it is hard to believe that the races that had produced Sant' Ambrogio and Jumi&egrave;ges should not have worked out independently the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the pointed arch. Its two great virtues are its slight thrust as compared with the round arch, and its <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> possibilities of variation in height. The elliptical diagonals of the Romans did not commend themselves to the builders of the North, and the doming that resulted from the uniform use of semicircular arches, while not offensive in the case of square areas, became impossible where oblong spaces were to be covered, the expedient of stilting the longitudinal arches not yet having suggested itself. With the pointed arch in use, all difficulties disappeared. Once introduced it became in a few years the universal form, and its beauty was such that it immediately won its way against the round arch for the spanning of all voids. Almost coincidentally with the acceptance of the pointed arch came the device of stilting, the transverse arches of Bury (c. 1125) being so treated. This would seem to indicate that to the Gothic builders the value of the pointed arch lay rather in its comparatively small thrust and in its intrinsic beauty than in the facility with which it might be used for obtaining level crowns in oblong vaulting areas. This stilting of the longitudinal arches was from the beginning almost invariable in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; structurally, it concentrated the vault thrust on a comparatively narrow vertical line, where it could be easily handled by the <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttress</a>; it permitted the largest possible window area in the clerestory, while the composition of lines and the delicately waved or twisted surfaces were so beautiful in themselves that, once discovered, they could not be abandoned by the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and beauty-loving <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>.

<p>The structural and &aelig;sthetic advance was now headlong in its impetuosity. A few years after <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury</a>, St-Germer de Fly was built, the date assigned by Professor Moore being about, 1130. Here we find a building almost as surprising as Jumi&egrave;ges; for if the date quoted above is correct, the church has no prototype, no promising stages of experiment. The vaulting, both of the <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, is stilted and has its full complement of ribs, the shafting throughout is finely articulated, the dimensions are stately, the proportions just and effective, while the easterly termination is a perfectly developed <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> with rudimentary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> &#151; a <em>chevet in posse.</em> The <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttresses</a> are still concealed under the triforium roof, and outwardly the building has no Gothic character whatever; but the Gothic organism is practically complete.

<p>With <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Abbot Suger's</a> St-Denis, the easterly termination of which is of original construction and is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1140, we come to what is almost the fully developed Gothic plan, order and system, together With the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> chevet of double apsidal <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. This last feature, perhaps the most brilliant in conception and splendid in effect of the several parts of a Gothic <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, may have been derived either from the triapsidal termination of the Carolingian basilican church, or from the polygonal domed structures of the same epoch. Transitional forms are found throughout the eleventh century, and the development from such a plan as that of St. Generou, on the one hand, or Aachen, on the other, to St-Denis presupposes only that degree of inventive force and overflowing vitality which, as a matter of fact, existed during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

<p>With the <em>chevet</em> as fully developed as it now appears in St-Denis, there remains only the gradual perfection and refinement of the structural system and the giving it that quality of distinctive beauty in every aspect that was to be the very flowering of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> civilization of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. From the middle of the twelfth century both processes went on apace and simultaneously. Noyon followed immediately, and here, it is maintained, the <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttress</a> for the first time emerged through the roof, displaying in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> fashion the system of construction, and at the same time bringing the abutment above the springing of the vault, where the greatest thrust actually occurred, while permitting the lowering of the triforium roof so that the clerestory window might be given great height and brought into better proportion with the arcade and triforium. Senlis, of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, exhibits a great advance in mechanical skill and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> exactitude, with an innovation that commands less admiration &#151; the substitution of cylindrical columns for the intermediate piers on the caps of which rest the shafts of the intermediate ribs of the sexpartite vault. Continued in Notre-Dame, Paris, this clever but unconvincing, device proved to be but an experimental form, and was abandoned as unsatisfactory in the greatest monuments of French Gothic, such Chartres, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and Amiens, where recourse was had to the specifically Gothic compound pier, with the shafts of the transverse ribs, at least, of the vault brought frankly and firmly down to the pavement.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was begun in 1163 with the choir, and completed in 1235 with the raising of the western towers. From East to West there is a steady growth in <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of touch, in structural efficiency, and in the expression through beauty of form and line of the culminating civilization of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medievalism</a>. The interior order exhibits the defects of the imperfectly organized Norman system, particularly in the lofty, vaulted triforium or gallery, so great in size that there is no rhythm in the relationship of arcade, triforium and clerestory, together with the columnar scheme of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> and Noyon (the imposing of the vault shafts on the caps of plain cylindrical columns), which must be regarded as falling back from the perfect articulation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Gothic system. The plan, however, is nobly developed, the general relations of height and breadth fine to a degree, while in the west front (1210-35) Gothic design reaches, perhaps, the highest point it ever achieved so far as classical simplicity, power, and proportion are concerned. The seed of Jumi&egrave;ges has developed into full fruition. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of Notre-Dame must rank as one of the few entirely perfect <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> accomplishments of man. With the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, also, the new art shows itself in all its wonderful inclusiveness; design, as apart from constructive <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, appears full flood in the entire treatment of the exterior; the Lombard <a href="../cathen/15653a.htm">rose window</a> has been evolved to its final point; decorative detail, both in design and in placing, has become sure and perfectly competent; while <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a>, and, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from records, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> have all forged forward to a point at least even with the sister art of architecture. In <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> especially the advance has been amazing. For many generations it was held that the restoration of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> as a fine art was due to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and specifically to <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Niccolo Pisano</a>, but as a matter of fact the task was accomplished in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a century before his time. The revival began in the South, where Byzantine remains were numerous and the tradition still lingered. At Clermont-Ferrand, by the end of the eleventh century, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of competent <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> had been developed; <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Moissac followed suit, and by 1140 the Ile-de-France was producing works which show "a grace and mastery of design, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and tenderness of sentiment, and a fineness and precision of chiselling that are unparalleled in any other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> save those of ancient <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the fifteenth century" (Moore, op. cit., XIII, 366). The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of St-Denis, of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, of Senlis, and of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> are perfect examples of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> beyond criticism in itself and exquisitely adapted to its architectonic function; the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in the portal of the north <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> may be placed for comparison side by side with the masterpieces of Hellenic <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and lose nothing by the test. Of <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> enough remains here and elsewhere to show how marvellous was the wholly new art brought into being by the genius of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medievalism</a>; and that the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and guilding of all the interior surfaces was on a scale of equal perfection, we are compelled to believe. As the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and churches now remain to us &#151; much of the glass destroyed by savage iconoclasm and brutality, every trace of colour vanished from the walls, while the original altars themselves have been swept away together with their gorgeous hangings and decorations (monstrosities like that of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, for instance, taking their places); shrines, screens, and <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, all wonderfully wrought and glorious in colour and gold, shattered and cast into the rubbish heap &#151; they can give but an inadequate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> at best of the nature of that <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> which in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries came as the result of a fusion of all the arts, each one of which had been raised to the highest point of efficiency. Of the lost colour of Gothic art Mr. Prior says,<blockquote>

<p>We can readily be assured that nothing of crudity found place in the colour scheme of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> &#151; for have we not their illuminated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in evidence? For its pure and delicate harmony, a page of a thirteenth or fourteenth century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> may compete with the work of the greatest masters of colour that the world has known, and we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the same mastery of brilliant and harmonious tints was shown in the colour scheme of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> (op. cit., Introd., 19).</p></blockquote>

<p>Some hint of what has been lost may be obtained from the faded frescoes of <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, as they may be seen today at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and Florence and <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> itself.

<p>The defects of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> are almost wholly absent in <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, which is the most nearly perfect of all Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> both in conception and in the details of its working out. It is unquestionably the noblest interior in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, even though the lower portions of its choir have been ruined by the most aggressive vandalism known to the eighteenth century. Its relations of dimension are of the same final and classical type as are those of the west front of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, while it stands at that middle point of achievement when the defects of the Norman system had been eliminated, and those of the too exuberant vitality of the thirteenth century had not yet appeared. As has been said above, Gothic architecture is an impulse and a tendency rather than a perfectly rounded accomplishment; the element of <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> entered into it as into no other of the great styles, and it was therefore subject not only to dazzling flights of spontaneous genius, but also to the misguided imaginings of daring innovators. The noble calm of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> was followed by the nervous complexity and lack of relation of Laon. Only five years after this same masterpiece of Notre-Dame was achieved, the <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttresses</a> of the <em>chevet</em> were reconstructed, and in place of the original fine simplicity and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of the system of doubled arcs, announcing perfectly the fundamental plan, were substituted the present daring and superb, but illogical and ungainly arches soaring from the outer abutments across both <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> sheer to the spring of the high vault. Similarly, when Amiens was built, the just proportions of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> were sacrificed to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of structural ability, and a faultless harmony of parts and proportions yielded to wire drawn elegance and awe-inspiring altitudes, destined a little later, in <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, to be the Nemesis of Gothic art. Finally, the system of concentrated loads, which made possible a structure of masonry that was but a skeleton, supporting vaults of stone and filled in by walls of glass, was so tempting to the sense of daring and to the inevitable <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of the French genius that it led to a recklessness in the reductions of solids to a minimum that, however much it may have justified itself structurally, however marvellous may have been the results it made possible in the line of glowing and translucent walls of Apocalyptic colour, must be considered as falling away from the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and the grandeur of a classically architectonic scheme such as that of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>.<blockquote>

<p>It was the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">Logic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> that brought to his Gothic both its extreme excellence and its decay: the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of vault construction fell in with his bent. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> once having attracted him, his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> faculty compelled him to follow it to the end. His vaults rose higher and higher; his poise and counterpoise, his linkage of thrust and strain grew more complicated and daring, until material mass disappeared from his design and his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> were chain-works of articulated stone pegged to the ground by pinnacles (Edward S. Prior, "A History of Gothic Art in England", I, 9).</p></blockquote>

<p>The fact must not be ignored, that even in the culminating monuments of the thirteenth century in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the mania for skeleton construction led to unfortunate subterfuges. The reduction of masonry was carried beyond a possible minimum, and its insufficiency was supplemented by hidden bars, ties, and chains of iron.<blockquote>

<p>The windows were sub-divided by strong grates of wrought-iron, some of the horizontal bars of which ran on through the piers continuously. At the Sainte Chapelle a chain was imbedded in the walls right round the building, and the stone vaulting ribs were reinforced by curved bands of iron placed on each side and bolted to them (W.R. Lethaby, "Mediaeval Art", VII, 161).</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of a too perfect mastery of the art of building, the great group of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> that followed during the thirteenth century in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> must always remain the crowning glory of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> architecture. Bourges, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and Amiens, with the numberless other examples of a perfected art, from the Channel to the Pyrenees, the Alps to the sea, form the greatest cycle of buildings in a definite and highly developed style that has ever been produced by man, and is the most salient exposition in history of human capacity for evolving a material perfection with absolute beauty and spiritual significance, all under the control and by the impulse of a dominant and undivided religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>There are three abstruse subjects connected with the nature and growth of Gothic architecture on which much has been written, yet nothing thus far that may be considered finally conclusive: <ul><li>the Commacini, or seventh-century guild of masons; <li>the "structural refinements" to which Professor Goodyear has devoted so much study; <li>the application of certain mystical numbers, and their relations to the solution of the problem of proportion.</ul> Of the Commacini, whose name first appeals in a mid-fifth-century document, Mr. Lethaby says,<blockquote>

<p>It is generally held by scholars that the word does not refer to a centre at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, but should be understood as signifying an association or guild of masons, and that the Magistri Commacini heard of in the seventh century were of no small importance. It does seem probable, however, that the expansion of N. Italian art over many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, which appears to have taken place in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, may be traced to the fact that in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the guilds had privileges which made members free to travel at a time when Western masons were attached to manors or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (W. R. Lethaby, "Mediaeval Art", IV, 114).</p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Goodyear may be assumed to have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the irregularities in plan, the variations in spacing, the inclination of walls, and all the other manifold peculiarities of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> building are in many ways premeditated, and not the result of negligence or accident. The &aelig;sthetic excuse he makes less obvious, however, nor has he yet established any general law which holds as consistently as do those governing <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> refinements in Greek architecture. The mystical deductions as to the persistence of certain numerical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the occult properties of numbers, and the angle called the "pi pitch" from the time of the builders of the pyramids, all of which are supposed to express certain fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and to have been transmitted from father to son for thousands of years, until they appear as the controlling principles of Gothic proportion, and the setting out of Gothic plans, may be found in "Ideal Metronomy" by the Rev. H. G. Wood (Boston, 1909).

<p>When the chevet of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> was finished, in 1254, the beginnings recorded in Jumi&egrave;ges two centuries before had worked themselves out to a point beyond which further wholesome development was impossible. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> had perfected what the Normans had initiated; the structural scheme inherent in Jumi&egrave;ges had progressed step by step to its conclusion; the great <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> harmonies of form and proportion and dimension, the mysterious and evocative powers of subtile and rhythmical relationship, had already achieved their highest fruition in <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, while an entirely new category of art, no sign of which had been accorded to the Normans, had by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> been brought again into being, viz., that of absolute beauty in decoration, whether in stone or glass or pigment, whether in itself as isolated detail or in regard to its placing and disposition. Moreover, this latter manifestation of art was in terms radically different to anything that had gone before, although the principles were identified with those of all great art: "In breadth of design, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of parts and measured recurrence of structural and ornamental elements, the Gothic artist obeyed, though in different form, the same primary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that had governed the ancient Greek" (Moore, op. cit., I, 22). The same was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of his sense of abstract and concrete beauty; in the contours of his mouldings, the carving of his caps and crockets, bosses and spandrels, the development of his decorative compositions of mass and line, and light and shade, he fell in no respect behind his brothers of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, while he exceeded those of Byzantium. The forms were different, wholly his own and original, but the essential spirit was the same.

<p>In the meantime Gothic architecture had been following a parallel course of development in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, borrowing directly from <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, assimilating what it so acquired, and giving to all a distinctly national character that tended from year to year further to separate English Gothic from any other, both structurally and artistically. No sooner was the Conquest effected in 1066, than the building of Norman <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, and churches was put in hand. Actually the introduction of Norman Romanesque occurred sixteen years earlier, viz., in 1050, when <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a> began the building of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. The earliest work differs in no essential particular from that of <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, except as regards size, which in many cases was astonishing; not only were the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> often far larger than anything in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, they were the greatest buildings in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Winchester and St. Paul's were more than double the ground area of the Abbaye aux Hommes, while the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury St. Edmund's</a> were each a fourth larger even than the gigantic Cluny itself. From the first the English peculiarity of great length combined with comparatively narrow <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> (30-35 feet in clear span) is conspicuous. As the Norman buildings were destroyed, and rebuilt under Gothic influence the original setting out was generally adhered to, and Gothic <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> are seldom found of a width greater than that of the Norman. Very early, also, occurs the typical deep English choir, Canterbury in 1096, having one nine bays in depth. This excessive length of the eastern arm was due quite as much to practical considerations, as to those of beauty. Religion was popular in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for some centuries after the Conquest, and great quantities of worshippers had to be provided for. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the choir of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> thrust itself through the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> half way to the west doors; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it usually took in at least the crossing; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of the Ile-de-France were secular and the very wide choirs easily accommodated the few canons. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, however, the numbers of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and canons was so great, and so many of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> were monastic in their foundation, that enormously long choirs were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the seating, in their narrow width, of those permanently attached to each church.

<p>The great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> were seldom vaulted, being covered by timber roofs of low pitch, except as regards their easily vaulted <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>. Barrel vaults were occasionally used, groin vaults in innumerable cases; the groin vault with ribs first occurs in Durham in 1093, an astonishing date, since the earliest ribbed vault claimed for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is in the diminutive church of Rhuis, a structure the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of which is unknown, but is placed at about 1100. The earliest known rib vault is claimed by Rivoira to be that of San Flaviano, in Umbria, but there is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether this is the original vault of a church known to have been built in 1032. San Nazzaro Maggiore, at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, has an authentic rib vault of 1075, and it appears therefore that the choir vault of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> is earlier than any certain example in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, however small, and that it was built within twenty years of the first dated rib vault in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. The vaults of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> are pointed and ribbed, and are not later than 1128, six years after the pointed arch appears in the little French church of Morienval.

<p>No further development towards Gothic in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> until the middle of the twelfth century. Great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in the fully developed Norman style, such as Kirkstall and <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a>, Malmesbury, <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, and Ely were reared all over <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but the prevailing monastic influence was <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, and this was always architecturally conservative, and at the same time magnificent. <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">Apses</a> with encircling <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatories</a> were almost invariable, and there was frequently the western <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, as at <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury</a> and <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>. Towards the end of the Norman period the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> influence greatly intensified the native richness in decoration of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> art, and to this we owe in great measure the rich and intricate carving of the late Norman work that persisted down even to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>, built in 1184. Before this date had occurred two events which were to initiate and, in varying degrees, control the growth of Gothic in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>: the coming of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> and the rebuilding of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> choir by <a href="../cathen/15638b.htm">William of Sens</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> always favoured Gothic, over the massive and grandiose Romanesque of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and Cluniacs, because of its early austerity and the economies it made possible in building. <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a>, also, and for similar reasons, adopted the economical new form, and this double influence was constantly exerted toward structural and artistic simplicity &#151; a fortunate thing for the new style, since it prevented a too early flowering in the richness and luxuriance of beautiful detail.

<p>That <a href="../cathen/15638b.htm">William of Sens</a> introduced to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and set before English eyes so much as he could of so much as then existed of French Gothic is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but it does not appear that his was the first Gothic done in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, or that it had a wide or lasting influence. Mr. Bond divides the local adaptation of Gothic into three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> &#151; that of the West, the North, and the South &#151; giving to the former priority in time. He says:<blockquote>

<p>The first complete Gothic of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> commences not with the choir of Lincoln, but of Wells, as begun by Reginald FitzBohun who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1174 to 1191. . . . It was in the West of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that the art of Gothic vaulting was first mastered; first, so far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>; and it was in the West, first apparently at Wells, that every arch was pointed, and the semicircular arch exterminated (op. cit., VII, 105).</p></blockquote>

<p>This development was underway at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Dor&eacute;, Wells, <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, and Glastonbury, to name only a few of the examples quoted, by the time the work at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> passed from the hands of <a href="../cathen/15638b.htm">William of Sens</a> to those of William the Englishman, and there is little evidence that it had any particular effect on the progress already begun. In the North, Lincoln choir followed close after Canterbury and was manifestly influenced by it in many ways, but as Mr. Bond says, "it is equally plain that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is almost wholly to the English and not to the French part of that design" (op. cit., VII, 111-12), for not all of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> choir is French, even in the case of the work of <a href="../cathen/15638b.htm">William of Sens</a> himself; the slender shafts of Purbeck marble, the springing of the vault ribs from the level of the triforium caps rather than from the string course above, the penetrations of the clerestory, the elaborately compound angle piers, with their ring of detached columns, are all English, and it precisely these features <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> copied at Lincoln. Neither does there appear in the retro-choir of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, begun about the time <a href="../cathen/15638b.htm">William of Sens</a> went back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, any evidence that his work had established a dominating precedent; here the work is of a distinctively native cast, the columns of the arcade in particular being original to a degree and of the most distinguished beauty.

<p>The exotic element in Canterbury proved to be but an episode and English Gothic went on developing itself after its own independent fashion. The choir of Lincoln exerted far greater influence and became the general model for all parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In some cases an attempt, and a successful one, was made to dispense with the vault entirely, as at <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, Tynemouth, and Whitby, where in each instance the timber roof of the Anglo-Norman <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was retained, and the chief attention was devoted to refining and improving the detail and composition of the wall design, where extremely beautiful results were obtained, as at Whitby, by the strictly English elaboration of the arch mouldings and the profiling of the pier sections. The <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttress</a> also was slow of acceptance and never, indeed, became the striking feature it was in all the buildings of thirteenth-century <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The English cared little for <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and less for structural brilliancy, or even consistency; the goals they aimed at were beauty in all its forms, individual expression, novelty, originality &#151; qualities they not seldom achieved at the expense of structural integrity. The Gothic of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was singularly consistent; it rapidly developed into a classical system from which no radical departures were made and into which the element of individual initiative hardly ever entered, once the body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and precedents had been established. The Gothic of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> never possessed any such canon either of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> or of taste. Every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, or master-builder strove to outdo his fellows, to strike out some new and dazzling masterpiece, and if, as a result, the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> building of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> failed of the finality, the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, and the uniformity of that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it achieved a variety and <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> far in advance of anything to be found across the channel. The second importation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, in the shape of <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, was apparently as helpless to change the English character as Canterbury choir had been; here also the French setting out, the <em>chevet</em>, the structural system, were overlaid with English qualities.<blockquote>

<p>We may readily make the fullest allowance for French influence at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, for so entirely is it translated into the terms of English detail that the result is triumphantly English. It is a remarkable thing indeed, that this church, which was so much influenced by French facts, should, <em>in spirit</em>, be one of the most English of English buildings (Lethaby: "Westminster Abbey and the King's Craftsmen", V, 125).</p></blockquote>

<p>French "facts" were apparently as helpless to control the general building of a people as they had been to restrain English workmen in their detail, and after the great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was finished in all its beauty <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> went on as before. By this time the stylistic quality of English Gothic had been pretty well fixed in such works as Beverley choir and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>; Christ Church and St. Patrick's, Dublin; Ely, presbytery, Southwell choir, Netley and Rievaulx Abbeys, together with the "Nine Altars" of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> and <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a>, all completed between the years 1225 and 1250, the peculiar qualities of English work had taken on a definite and very beautiful form. This is the period usually denominated "Early English", and, it shows no particular advance in structural development, it records a notable change in point of design; nearly all the attention of the builders seems devoted to solving the problems of beauty in form and line, in detail and composition &#151; this chiefly in the interior treatment. The relations of the arcade, triforium, and clerestory, the varying designs of the latter with their subtile arrangements of slender shafts and delicate lancets; the beautiful pier sections and moulding profiles, together with the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of capitals, bosses, crockets, and terminals &#151; varying as between the many sub-schools of the four main <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> provinces, yet always marked by a quality of pure beauty seldom attained even in the Ile-de-France &#151; all are significant of a distinctively national artistic development, even though it follows lines other than those that held across the Channel.

<p>Coincidentally with the building of Westminster went on such works as the retro- choir of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14736d.htm">Tintern Abbey</a>, wherein are the first signs of change from Early English to Geometrical. This process was continued up to the end of the century, and in the works of its last quarter are to be found the highest attainments of English art. Carlisle choir and east front, <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> and Pershore choirs, and St. Mary's Abbey, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, are all expressed in a type of art that rises to the level of the highest attainments of man. The exquisite line-composition of Pershore and of York Abbeys, the refinement combined with masculine strength, the swift, steel-like curves of the moulding profiles, the perfected beauty of the carved foliage, together with the masterly arrangement of the lines and spaces of light, the hollows and depths of shade &#151; all work together to build up a masterly art. Much of the product of this time has perished, and even of York Abbey, which seems to represented the high-water mark of pure English design, nothing remains except a shattered aisle wall, a crossing pier, and a few piles of marble fragments. Though at the beginning of the nineteenth century the greater portion of the fabric was intact, about 1820 it was sold to speculators to be burned into lime.

<p>During the first half of the fourteenth century <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> progress was cumulative, reaching its apogee during the reign of <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>. The fine simplicity and almost Hellenic feeling for line visible in the work of the preceding half century, and that gives it a place in this respect in advance of any other Gothic work of any time or people, has yielded to decorative richness, the multiplication of ornament and detail, and an intricate composition of light and shade. The incomparable carving of Lincoln and Wells, York Abbey, West Walton, and Llandaff, <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> yet with all the qualities of form that are found in the noblest <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, yields first to the lovely, but naturalistic, type of Southwell <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a>, then to the globular forms, the bulbous modelling, and the effete curves of Patrington, Heckington, and the fourteenth-century <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Beverley and <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>. Curvilinear window tracery, in all its suave grace, has taken the place of the fine and vigorous forms as of Netley, advanced a stage beyond the prototypes of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Finally, the brilliantly articulated lierne vaulting, with its intermediate ribs emphasizing the verticality of the composition and carrying out to completion in the roof the fine drawing of multiple piers and moulded arches, is swerving towards the unjustifiable type that came just before the fan vault, i.e., the criss-crossing of a network of purely decorative ribs over the vault-surfaces in violation of structural principle.

<p>Decadence and perfect achievement go hand in hand &#151; Exeter <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, the finest English interior remaining intact, on the one hand, Wells presbytery, on the other. But whatever the weaknesses that were showing themselves, they entered little into the make-up of the great <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, which represent, more than the episcopal and monastic structures, the genius of the period. This was one of the three great epochs of such <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> architecture in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and it is not to be forgotten that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> qualities of English Gothic art reveal themselves quite as fully in the minor as in the major buildings of this country. For a full century, i.e. from 1350 until 1450, the history of English Gothic is largely a history of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church-building. The Black Death, which in 1349 smote the land with a pestilence that cut its population almost in halves, was followed by the War of the Roses, and the peace and prosperity of <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> did not wholly return until the accession of Henry VII. During this long period, however, the trend of stylistic development was wholly changed by the remarkable innovations initiated by Abbot Thokey at Gloucester in 1330, and carried on by <a href="../cathen/15641a.htm">William of Wykeham</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> from 1380.<blockquote>

<p>The supreme importance of Gloucester in the history of the later Gothic has never been adequately recognized. She turned the current of English architecture in a wholly new direction. But for Gloucester, English Decorated work might well have developed into a Flamboyant as rich and fanciful as that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. But to the remotest corners of the land, to <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, collegiate and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, there was brought the influence of Gloucester by the countless <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the shrine of Edward the Second in her choir (Bond, op. cit., VII, 134).</p></blockquote>

<p>The manifest tendencies of the Decorated &#151; not, it must be confessed, of the most promising kind &#151; were terminated and instead a new progress was instituted toward development of what we now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as Perpendicular the first style of architecture that can properly be called "English". Hitherto English Gothic has been rather a lovely overlaying of Continental principles by a distinctively racial decoration and a certain fine fastidiousness of design, with minor modifications of plan and system that left the foundations intact, so far as they had been apprehended and assimilated. Now was to come a perfectly independent manifestation in which system, design, and decoration were all new and all exclusively English. The adoption of the French scheme of a structural framework, the walls being no longer of masonry, but of glass set in a thin scaffolding of stone mullions, was at last adopted, but its working-out bore almost no relation whatever to the French method. Before the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> revolution there were signs that sense of proportion and composition was decaying, as for example in the Lady Chapel of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> (1321), which has almost no architectonic qualities to commend it, but, whether <a href="../cathen/15641a.htm">William of Wykeham</a> or profounder <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> influences are responsible, the fact remains that the danger was averted, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> recalled to sounder principles, which resulted in a new life in Gothic that persisted until <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and the regents under Edward VI brought the whole epoch of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval civilization</a> to an end and surrendered an unwilling people to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Winchester <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and York choir; Westminster Hall, King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and St. George's, Windsor; Sherborne and Malvern, the choir vault of Oxford <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Henry VII at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, together with the major part of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges, the great central towers of many of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and, finally, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches of all sizes and almost without number, are indicative of the surprising new life in art and therefore of the strength of the sound <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> civilization of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The beauty of the new style, its structural integrity, and its fecund variety are worthy of high admiration. What it lacked of the majesty of form and the serene reserve of an earlier time is almost made up for by a fineness of line, a richness of design without opulence, and a splendour of colour that find few antecedents in history, while the fan vault takes its place as one of the very great inventions of architecture. "In these splendid vaultings of the fifteenth century we have indeed the last work of English monastic art" (Prior, op. cit., VII, 95).

<p>Step by step, from her point of departure from the Gothic of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had worked out to the full her own form of Gothic artistic expression. French precedents sat lightly upon her, and she was not favourably disposed to coercion. In plan the Norman and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> type had been adhered to, and instead of that concentration which had produced in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a parallelogram with one end semicircular, there had been an expansion which resulted in the episcopal or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross plans of Lincoln, Beverley, and Salisbury &#151; long, narrow <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, equally long choirs, widely-spreading, <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisled</a> <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, and frequently choir <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> as well, with a deep Lady Chapel prolonging the main axis still further to the east. The plan of a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> such as <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or Amiens announces its ordonance but indifferently; that of an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, exactly. Outwardly, the former is hardly more than a mountainous mass without composition; vast and awe-inspiring, but without emphasis or variety, except in regard to its western front when taken by itself. The latter &#151; with its long, lateral <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, it building-up by successive planes, both horizontal and vertical, its Lady Chapel, choir, central tower, and west towers, its bold <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> &#151; becomes an elaborate yet monumental composition of brilliant and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> varied light and shade. With the exception of Hales, Lincoln, and Beaulieu (now destroyed), Tewkesbury, and Westminster, the <em>chevet</em> gained no hold in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, nor did the apsidal termination widely commend itself; instead, the square east end became the established type, and when to this was added a retro-choir with a still lower Lady Chapel still further to the east, the result was an independent <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> scheme equally admirable to that complex glory of the French <em>chevet.</em>

<p>Mr. Prior advances the interesting theory that the square east end was a fixed feature of both Saxon and Celtic church-buildings, that it was taken to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> by <a href="../cathen/14290d.htm">St. Stephen Harding</a>, the Englishman, who had been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Sherborne in Dorset, where the old national tradition had survived the Norman invasion, and that it came back with the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, who, by their sheer dynamic force, were able to impose it at last on <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and secular <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> alike, so bringing an originally local device to its own again. He says further:<blockquote>

<p>In this matter the Canterbury choir of <a href="../cathen/15638b.htm">William of Sens</a> was a survival rather than a pattern for English use. By the end of the twelfth century the small Keltic sanctuary had imposed itself on the choirs of our great Norman churches still more decisively than it had in the basilican introduction of St. Augustine (A History of Gothic Art in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, II, 79).</p></blockquote>

<p>In height, as related to breadth, the earlier and more reserved French relations were never exceeded, while they were often discounted; until Tudor times the elimination of the wall in favour of skeleton construction combined with glass screens, found little following, and a grave and conservative relationship was preserved between solids and voids. The central tower, the culmination and concentration of the composition, was almost invariable, while the west front was usually subordinated to the design as a whole. The elaborate articulation of piers and archivolts, until both became compositions of fine lines of light and shade, was carried further in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> than elsewhere, and the introduction of tiercerons, or accessory vault ribs, with the ridge ribs to receive them, was in keeping with an <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> that felt the subtle beauty of these multiplied lines. The <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> sense, that demanded the grounding of every downward thrust of vault rib either at the pavement or on the abacus of the pier or column caps, was not operative, and in most cases the vault shafts were stopped on corbels above the level of <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> capitals. From the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> aversion to ornament, and perhaps also in part from the use of turned shafts of dark marble applied to the piers and bonded in by stone rings or bronze dowels, came the turned and moulded cap with the circular abacus. In its polygonal chapter houses <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> developed a brilliant conception all its own, and almost the same might be said of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, while in the designing of <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, chantries, reredoses, choir-screens, and chancel-fittings of wood, the delicate fancy of the English had full play in the creation of a mass of exquisite <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and joinery that has no counterpart elsewhere. If <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and consistency are the note of French Gothic, <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and daring are those of the Gothic of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The west fronts of <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, Bury St. Edmunds, Wells, <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, and Lincoln; the chapter houses of York, <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, Lincoln, and Westminster; the octagon of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, the fan vaulting of Gloucester, Sherborne, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and Westminster &#151; all are examples of a vitality of impulse, a fertility in conception, a soaring <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and a cheerful disregard of scholastic precedent that give English Gothic a quality of its own as important in the make-up of the art expression of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as is the masterly and final structural achievement of the Ile-de-France.

<p>Outside <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the racial adaptations of the Gothic impulse are much less vital and distinctive. <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> early evolved a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which had great influence in the development of style in the West of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but it soon became merged therein and did not long preserve its identity: <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> shows in its minor monastic work peculiar and very individual qualities. In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> French influence was more pronounced than in the South, and the Norman of Jedburgh and Kelso, the Gothic of Dryburgh, Melrose, and Edinburgh deserve more careful study than has yet been given them. In all essential particulars, however, they are of the English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and show no radical departures from the type established in the South by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Cluniacs, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, Augustinians, and Friars. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the Gothic expression was slow in establishing itself, few evidences appearing before the Gothic style had reached perfection in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.<blockquote>

<p>A reason for this, may perhaps be found in the fact that <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the twelfth century possessed a Romanesque architecture which, especially in the important churches along the Rhine, was of a very admirable character and was well suited to the tastes of the German people (Moore, op. cit., VII, 237).</p></blockquote>

<p>Another reason may also be discovered in the further fact that the pressure of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> influence during its great formative period was towards <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> rather than in the direction of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, wile the impulse of creative civilization in the twelfth century was from Norman and <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rather than Teutonic blood. When, about the middle of the thirteenth century, French architects began the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne after the exaggerated manner of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, they might almost have claimed that theirs was the first Gothic structure in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Pointed arches and ribbed vaults had appeared sporadically in some of the larger churches at the end of the twelfth century, such as Worms, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Bamberg, but the lateral arches are not stilted, and so far as proportion, design, exterior treatment and detail are concerned, these churches are strictly of the Rhenish Romanesque type, as are indeed, awkwardly, the internally more Gothic Magdeburg and Limburg, St. Gereon, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and the Liebfrauenkirche, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, the first completed in 1227, the second begun in the same year, are churches of novel plan, each apparently having resulted from an effort, to turn a French <em>chevet</em> into a church by repeating its design, so producing a plan approximating a circle, and harking back in an indeterminate sort of way to the polygonal, domed churches of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; in both cases French schemes and forms have been used rather superficially and with little appreciation. Cologne remains, in spite of these examples, the first church in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> that is strictly Gothic in its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and its setting out, but even here its detail and ornament are German rather than French. It had a considerable influence on the superficial development of style, and towards the end of the century such works as St. Elizabeth, Marburg, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Freiburg show the spreading of a style that had come too late to reach any very complete fruition. Until the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, when curious fantasies in design and decoration gave to German Gothic a certain unquestioned individuality, the contributions to the development of this phase of art were not notable; the most conspicuous is the <em>Hallenbau</em> scheme which consists in raising one or more <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> on either side of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> to an equal height therewith, or rather in building a great hall roofed with level vaulting supported on rows of slender shafts dividing it in <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>. L&uuml;beck has five of these churches, others no less than seven. The <em>Hallenbau</em> church, whatever its width, was usually covered by one enormous roof, and the result, both internally and externally, is as far as possible from the Gothic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> assemblage of parts, each bearing a just and beautiful proportion to the others, all interrelated and forming a highly articulated organism, the exterior of which announced explicitly every structural form of plan and ordonance. The "open-work" spire, such as that of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, is a German development of a Flamboyant <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, which had much aesthetically to commend it, its lacelike surfaces being often treated with great effectiveness.

<p>Flemish Gothic is distinctly a sub-school of that of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> rather than of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, built in 1060 is still Rhenish Romanesque, though pointed arches and certain <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> qualities are creeping in; its proportions, however, partake of the finer feeling of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, even though its general conception is Rhenish. During the first half of the thirteenth century such thoroughly strong and refined examples of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Gothic as St. Martin, Ypres, St. Bavon and St. Michael, <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, appear, widely divided in the quality from the halting efforts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> proper. The civic work of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> is perhaps its most distinctively national creation, and the Cloth Hall, Ypres, with the great group of fourteenth-century town halls &#151; <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Oudenarde, Alost, and Ghent &#151; while excessive in their flamboyant detail, yet retain the essential elements of fine composition and vigorous design.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the introduction of Gothic forms was as long delayed as in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, while, so far as native work is concerned, the fundamental principles of Gothic construction were never accepted at all. It was essentially a northern art, and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> neither the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> disposition of the people nor the spiritual and temporal conditions put a premium on <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in themselves racially foreign. Nevertheless, once introduced, they produced in many cases very beautiful results, particularly in decoration and design, and Italian Gothic certainly contributes valuable elements to the total of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art. During the eleventh century one <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> after another had come into existence in almost every part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, all based more or less on some local modification of the primitive basilican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, yet varying in different directions as the peculiar influences of each section might direct. In Torcello, Murano, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> these were naturally Byzantine, more or less modified by the variations at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, Byzantine influence was mingled with strains from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> sources and with a strong influence brought in by King Roger and his Norman followers. <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and Florence worked on their own lines with some slight Lombardic admixture, while those portions of the peninsula under Lombard control developed their vital and inspiring style from the persisting Carolingian tradition. The abstract beauty much of this Italian product of the eleventh century is very pronounced, St. Mark's at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, San Miniato at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/03476a.htm">Cefal&ugrave;</a>, <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>, and the Capella Palatina in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; Troja, <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Toscanella</a>, San Michele at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, San Zeno at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> &#151; all possess elements of great art, but no one of the styles indicated by any of these buildings was destined to a final working-out under cultural conditions that made such a result inevitable. Development during the twelfth century was almost wholly local in its extent and decorative in its scope, and it was not until the coming of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, with their Gothic of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, at the opening of the thirteenth century, that the incipient or reminiscent local modes were extinguished, and an attempt made at a general unification of style.

<p>Apparently the Gothic influence had come too late. The era when architecture was to be the favourite mode for the artistic voicing of a civilization was, at least in the South, nearly at an end; <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> were to take its place, and therefore the Gothic architecture of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was to remain both racially alien and in its nature episodical. In the former class are those churches the designs of which were apparently imported almost bodily from <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, such as Fossanova, Casmari, and San Galgano, all works of great beauty of form and proportion, all vaulted in stone, the two former having fully developed rib vaults with stilted lateral arches in good Gothic form, though in none is the <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">buttress</a> system well developed. A little later come Sant' Andrea, <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> (1219-24), said to be the work of an English architect, but manifestly French, with a full system of <a href="../cathen/03092a.htm">flying buttresses</a>, San Francesco at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> (1228-53), attributed by <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> to a German architect, but also unmistakably French in its first inspiration, though considerably modified by what may well be local <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> influence, and San Francesco at Bologna, of which much the same may be said.

<p>The first really local development of Gothic seems to have been at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, Sta. Croce and Sta. Maria Novella at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, dating from the end of the century, varying so widely from any contemporary form of Gothic that their peculiarities must be assigned either to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> themselves or to the influx of Italian <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. One of the fundamental characteristics of Gothic is a sense of just proportion and a fine relationship of parts, combined with a passion for beauty of line, form, light and shade colour, and their relationships, not invariably achieved but always sought for with a consuming eagerness. These qualities are almost wholly lacking in the churches above named, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> itself, which partakes of nearly all of their peculiarities. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> built their own great, popular churches, while they worked for the same large open spaces and economy of material, they nevertheless regarded these considerations of proportion and pure beauty, therefore the conclusion seems inevitable that it is not to the nature of the Mendicant Orders, but to some incapacity in the race, as it then was, that we owe the radical shortcomings of the work of Arnolfo and his fellows in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The fact remains, however, that the great churches of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> are the chief offenders. San Giovanni e Paolo and the Frari at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, San Petronio, Bologna, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Florence are, with the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars'</a> churches in the city last named, brilliant examples of the lamentable results that may be obtained when the structural and &aelig;sthetic <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of a great style are ignored or misunderstood. <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> avoid the bald ugliness of this class of work, but in their structure they have no kinship with Gothic, while in respect to their <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> the only quality they possess which is Gothic in any degree is a certain sense of beauty in ornament, itself derived from a recurrence to the forms of nature for inspiration, combined with an intense refinement of line and modelling and a blending of the arts of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and colour in a poetic and lovely composition. Perhaps the nearest approach to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Gothic feeling and accomplishment is to be found in the unfinished front of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; being of the twelfth century, it is sufficiently early to have received something of the first great Gothic impulse, and is a masterpiece of delicate relations and exquisite detail. The best Gothic work in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> is not <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, but secular, and is to be found in the palaces of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and Bologna. The Doge's Palace and the innumerable private structures of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in the first-named city have all the qualities of pure beauty of design and detail, as well as the unerring sense of proportion and relationship, that are characteristic of Gothic art, while the forms through which these are expressed are wholly <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a>, yet with a complete racial note that raises them almost to the dignity of a national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Gothic design.

<p>Spain, as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> State, was non-existent except as a small area of still unconquered territory near the Pyrenees, until the middle of the thirteenth century, when Ferdinand III, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, united the crowns of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> and Leon, won back Seville and Cordova, and established the final victory of the Cross over the Crescent in the Iberian Peninsula. Until this time the Gothic spirit had hardly more than crossed the mountains and always as a direct importation from <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Aquitaine; Salamanca <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, St. Vincent of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, <a href="../cathen/15085b.htm">Tudela</a>, and Tarragona, the Abbey of Verula, and the church of <a href="../cathen/07512b.htm">Las Huelgas</a> at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, all built between 1120 and 1180, show a very undeveloped type of early Gothic construction, combined with a rich and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> treatment of Southern Romanesque design in the exterior. Salamanca and St. Isidoro at <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> both possess domes or lanterns over the crossing, remarkable in point of structural ingenuity and beauty of design both internally and externally. If the scheme was borrowed from the other side of the Pyrenees, it has been wholly transformed and glorified, and this brilliant innovation, containing such possibilities of development that were never carried further, may justly be attributed to native Spanish genius. No progressive growth occurred, however, during the next fifty years, and it was not until the definitive victories of St. Ferdinand made Spanish nationality possible, and the coming of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> spiritual impulse, that Gothic architecture in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense appeared in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and then as another direct importation from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> rather than as a development of the latent racial qualities inherent in Salamanca. <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, Toledo, and Leon are closely French in their setting-out and ordonance, but in detail they vary widely from all French precedents. There is a southern richness and romance both in the exterior and interior design and detail of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, for example, as well as in the other Spanish work from the middle of the thirteenth century onward, that gives it a certain <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> quite distinct from that of any other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Gothic. This sumptuousness of detail and colour, and composition of light and shade, enters into every detail; altars and reredoses, the latter often vast in size and of the richest materials; grilles of intricately wrought and chiselled metal; sculptured <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>; stalls of the most elaborate carving; great pictures, tapestries, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> innumerable, together with a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> type of <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> in the most brilliant colouring, were lavished on every church; and since <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> has escaped the pillage and destruction of religious revolutions, much of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> completeness remains, though considerably overlaid with a thick coating of <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and therefore it is only in Spanish churches that one may obtain some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the general effect of a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> church as it once was before it became subjected to the mishandling of revolutionists, iconoclasts, and restorers.

<p>The end of Gothic architecture and of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> art came with varying degrees of rapidity and at different times as between the several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Generally speaking, its death-knell was sounded when the work of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> was temporarily undone, and the French Crown established a temporal control over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The exile at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, begun in 1305, followed as it was by the Great Schism, broke the links that bound kings and peoples to the hitherto dominant Church, opened the doors of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to the influx of the neo-paganism that came from the East with the fall of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> in 1453, permitted the uprising of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in all parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and made possible the supremacy in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> of the tyrants of the fourteenth century &#151; Visconti, Sforza, <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>. The Black Death, which scourged all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the Hundred Years War in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> brought down from its high estate the civilization that had flowered at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and Amiens, and when architecture began to recover itself in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> after the return of peace, its advance was on lines suggested by the fourteenth century Gothic of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which had continued to grow rich and fertile, the most vital <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Gothic art of the time. The seeds were sown during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> itself, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. John Baptist of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, built in 1375, being of a fully developed Flamboyant style. From now on the substitution was complete; whatever building there was, was explicitly Flamboyant; the old <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> system, the old breadth and nobility of design, detail always duly subordinated to just composition, were gone almost in a night. Says Enlart:<blockquote>

<p>Ce style, qui est l'exag&eacute;ration et la d&eacute;cadence de l'art gothique, n'apporte presque aucun perfectionnement &agrave; l'art de b&acirc;tir ou de dessiner, mais seulement un syst&egrave;me d&eacute;coratif tr&egrave;s particulier et plus ou moins arbitraire, qui, appliqu&eacute; sans exception dans les moindres d&eacute;tails, produit beaucoup d'effet et beaucoup d'harmonie d'ensemble ("This style, which is the exaggeration and decadence of Gothic art, adds hardly any perfecting to the art of building or of designing, but only a very peculiar and more or less arbitrary system of decoration, which, when applied with thorough consistency to the minutest details, is very effective and produces a very harmonious general effect." &#151; "Manuel d'arch&eacute;ologie fran&ccedil;ais", I, 586).</p></blockquote>

<p>The delicate and fantastic beauty of Flamboyant detail is unquestionable, and, as decoration, the lacelike webs of thinness, graceful curving forms, and craftily spotted lights and shades, as they appear in <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and Abbeville west fronts and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, in Louviers, Caudebec, Notre-Dame de l'Epine, St. Maclou, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, St-Michel, and St-Germain, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, are amongst the most charming creations of artistic fancy. It must be remembered, however, that it is all strictly a form of decoration, not an architectonic style, nor even a sub-school thereof, unless in such peculiarly admirable examples as the very Troyes ifa&ccedil;ade, the <em>chevet</em> of Mt. St-Michel, and the very wonderful St-Germain at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, the still persisting quality of structural integrity combined with just proportions and a certain unusual restraint in the placing of decoration justify a dignity hardly argued by the unparalleled license of the general output of the Flamboyant period. To a certain extent it is an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> mystery, for it is an excessive refinement of art appearing after the close of a period of sound and vigorous civilization, in the midst of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, contemporaneously with religious degradation, growing side by side with tendencies that in a few years were to bring the civilization it connotes forever to an end. In this it was not alone, however. Similar conditions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> surrounded the culmination of the great arts of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, while in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the delicate and exquisite Perpendicular Gothic reached its highest development in the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. Says Mr. Porter, in considering this phenomenon:<blockquote>

<p>Thus in the hour of political and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> misfortune, in the midst of the financial ruin and degradation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was born flamboyant architecture &#151; the last frail blossom of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> genius. Did this art come into being as a prophetic manifestation of the great national awakening that was to produce <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Jeanne d'Arc</a> and shake off the English yoke? I should hardly dare affirm it, for the history of architecture ever reflects, rather than presages, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> developments (op. cit., II, X, 368).</p></blockquote>

<p>One may go further even than this, and say that the flowering of art is always a generation or more later than the causes of its being. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> are the last of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval epoch</a>, rather than the forerunners of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> is Elizabethan by accident of birth, but essentially he is the fruit of pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> is the flowering of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medievalism</a>, rather than the germinating seed of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and similarly the poetic, if inorganic, Flamboyant art of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> takes its colour not from the downfall of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> civilization in fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but from the better days that preceded the great <em>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</em>. The magic of fifteenth-century art is neither the unwholesome iridescence of decay nor the first brightening towards the dawn of a <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, but the afterglow of a great day, in the brightness of which stood the creative personalities of Sts. Odo of Cluny and <a href="../cathen/13097d.htm">Robert of Molesme</a>, Bernard and Norbert, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a>.

<p>Generally speaking, fifteenth-century architecture throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> is secular as opposed to the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> Romanesque and Norman, and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Gothic of the three preceding centuries. Perpendicular Gothic in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and its derivative, Tudor, is largely the product of guilds of architects, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, and masons working primarily for great merchants and the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, the latter being the dominant religious influence of the time. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> the Flamboyant style is peculiarly the product of the individualistic architect and the purveyor of artistic luxuries, and during the entire period the best and most significant work is to be sought amongst guild-halls, palaces, castles, manors, and colleges, and in the towers, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> and other memorials paid for by the new orders of rich merchants and affluent courtiers.

<p>The end now came rapidly. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Gothic feeling as well as Gothic forms had disappeared altogether by the end of the fifteenth century, the last flicker of the instinctive art of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medievalism</a>, as distinguished from the premeditated artifice of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, appearing in the work of the Lombardi in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and in such structures as the church of Sta Maria dei Miracoli and the Scuola di San Marco (1480- 95). In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> something of Gothic romance and intrinsic beauty continued down to 1550 in the <em>manoirs</em> and <em>ch&acirc;teaux</em>, while in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> it dragged along a few decades longer in some isolated instances. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the superb central tower of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> was built as late as 1567, though already full-fledged <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> work was in process in other parts of the Peninsula. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the sumptuous Perpendicular of the Chapel of Henry VII at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> hardened rapidly into the formalities of later Tudor when, and ceased wholly as a definite style when the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the separation of the English Church from the Roman obedience and the imposition of the principles of the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation of Germany</a> on the English people brought church-building to an end. With the final submission of the English during the reign of Elizabeth to a dogmatic revolution they had not invited, but were powerless to resist, came an influx of German influence that rapidly wiped out the very tradition of Gothic, except in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and in that of the minor domestic building, substituting in its place the most unintelligent used classical forms anywhere to be found in the history of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. At Oxford and Cambridge the cultural tradition was strong enough to withstand for a century the complete acceptance of the new fashion, and down to the middle of the seventeenth century the elder tradition persisted in such work as St. John's, Cambridge, and Wadham, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, while its compulsion was so strong as to coerce even <a href="../cathen/08500b.htm">Inigo Jones</a> into building the fine garden front of St. John's, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in a style at least reminiscent of what had been universal two centuries before. The same instinctive impulse continued in the case of manors and farmsteads even to a later date, and to this day in certain portions of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the stone-mason, carpenter, and tile layer preserve the old rules and traditions of the craft that have been handed down from father to son for centuries.

<p>From the year 1000 to the year 1500, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had slowly worked out its own form of artistic expression, largely through "the most consummate art of building which the world has achieved" (Prior, "History of Gothic Art in England", I, 7). As <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> had done in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, so, and equally, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> wrought in the North. Primarily it was an art of church-building and adornment for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was the one concrete and unmistakable fact in life. "While all else was unstable and changeful, she, with her unbroken tradition and her uninterrupted services vindicated the principle of order and the moral continuity of the race . . . . . . The services of monastic and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> alike, their offices of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, charity and labour in the field and the hovel, in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> as well as in the church were for centuries, the chief witness of the spirit of human brotherhood (Norton, "Historical Studies of Church Building in the Middle Ages", I, 16). Therefore, on the heels of the tenth-century triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> came the eleventh-century passion for church-building; as says Rudolphus, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Cluny, writing in the midst of it all, "Erat enim instar ac si mundus ipse excutiendo semet, rejecta vetustate, passim candidam ecclesiarum vestem indueret" (It was as if the world, shaking itself and putting off the old things, were putting on the white robe of churches). The old vesture was indeed cast away and the new "white robe of churches" was of other make. The underlying <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the new style were identical with those of all other great styles, the vision of beauty was no different in any respect, the forms alone were absolutely new. For five centuries the artistic mode of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> went on its way without a pause, one in spirit wherever it was found.<blockquote>

<p>The motives which inspired these great buildings of this period, the principles which underlay their forms, the general character of the forms themselves were in their essential nature the same throughout Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The differences in the works of different lands are but local and external varieties (Norton, op. cit., I, 10).</p></blockquote>

<p>This universal mode was universally destroyed, and in the space of a few years. With the opening of the fifteenth century the victory of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> was definitely assured, while it was brought to its completion just a century later. Of the product of these five centuries of activity comparatively little remains intact. As Mr. Prior says, "Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> up to the middle of the sixteenth century might be called a treasure house filled with gems of Gothic genius. The <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrations</a> and revolutions of two centuries wrecked one half, swept Gothic <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> clear of their ornaments and then levelled to the ground many of the fabrics which they furnished. Of much that was not actually destroyed, carelessness and neglect and the necessities of rebuilding have since made equal havoc . . . . At its worst this re-building, re-painting re-carving has been wanton and causeless substitution . . . . For the next generation to us any direct acquaintance with the great comprehensive Gothic genius, except by means of parodies, will be difficult" (A History of Gothic Art in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, I, 3, 4). Enough remains, however, to enable us to reconstruct, at least in <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, an unique artistic product of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization of which it is possible for Professor Norton to say that "it advanced with constant increase of power of expression, of pliability and variety of adaptation, of beauty in design and skill in construction until at last, in the consummate splendour of such a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as that of Our Lady of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> or of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, it reached a height of achievement that has never been surpassed" (op. cit., I, 13).
