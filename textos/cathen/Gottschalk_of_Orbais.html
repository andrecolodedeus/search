<h1>Gottschalk of Orbais</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; b. about 800, d. after 866, probable 30 October, 868 (or 869), in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hautvilliers near <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>; son of a noble Saxon count named Berno, who presented him when still a child, as an oblate in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. When Gottschalk came of age, he felt no vocation for the religious state, and asked to leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, following the prevailing opinion of the age, held that a child, who had been presented as an oblate by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, was bound to become a religious, and in consequence, Gottschalk was made a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> against his will. Before receiving major orders he fled from <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and obtained <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at the Council of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in June, 829. <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, however, appealed to the emperor and defended his position in a special treatise: "De oblatione puerorum" (P.L., CVII, 419-440), whereupon Gottschalk was compelled to live the life of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> but was granted the privilege of exchanging the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> for that of Orbais, in the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a>. In order to make his enforced life in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> more bearable, Gottschalk, who had brilliant talents, gave himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He found great pleasure in the works of St. Augustine whose <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> attracted him in an especial manner.

<p>If we may believe his opponents, Gottschalk misinterpreted some difficult some passages in the writings of St. Augustine and developed a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> of double <em>complete</em> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and for eternal reprobation. He left his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> without permission, and under the pretence of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, traveled through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, spreading his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> wherever he went. In 840 Noting, the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, informed <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> of the rapid spread of Gottschalk's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and asked him to write a treatise against it. The treatise is found in P.L., CLXII, 1530-53. After his return from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Gottschalk had himself <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, to whose diocese he belonged, but by the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> Richbold of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and again returned to ltaly. In 846 <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> warned Count Eberhard of Friuli against Gottschalk, who was enjoying the count's hospitality. Gottschalk now returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, Pannonia, and Noricum. On 1 October, 848, he appeared at the Council of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> was condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and he was delivered for punishment to his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a>. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in Quierzy in the spring of 849, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to burn his writings, was deposed from his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office because he had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by a <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> without the consent or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and was whipped in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a>, which prescribes such punishment for refractory <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. He was then <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for life in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hautvilliers where he died obstinate and mentally deranged, after an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of about twenty years.

<p>Most of Gottschalk's writings have been lost. There still remain two short treatises in defense of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, in the form of two confessions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (P.L., CXXI, 347-366); some fragments of a work against Rabanas Maurus (P.L. loc. cit. 365-368); and some well-written poems (Traube, loc. cit. below).

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether Gottschalk's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> was <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. There is nothing in his extant writings that cannot be interpreted in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense. He, indeed, taught that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not wish all men to be saved, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died only for those who were <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to be saved; but these doctrines are not necessarily <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. He may have meant (and certain passages in his extant writings warrant the assumption) that, in consequence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowing that that some men will die on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He does not wish these to be saved; and that <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's death</a> was of no avail to those who will be damned for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Gottschalk's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the Trinity scarcely admits a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpretation. He appears to hold that the one and common nature of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">three Persons in God</a> is merely an abstract universal, which becomes individualized and receives concrete existence in the three Persons and that, hence, each Person has its own separate deity (see Hinckmars's "De una et non trina deitate" in P.L., CXXV, 473-618).
