<h1>Grace at Meals</h1>  

<p>In Apostolic times <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> counsels the faithful: "Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). This precept did not cease to be observed. "Before taking nourishment", says <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, "it is fitting to praise the Creator of all things, and it is fitting also to sing His praises when we take as nourishment the things created by Him" (<a href="../fathers/02092.htm"><em>The Pedagogue</em> II.4</a>). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, a contemporary of Clement, shows us the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the beginning of the third century making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on taking their places at table (De cor. milit., iii). "Our repasts", says he, refering to the Agape, "are in nothing vile or immodest. We do not recline until we have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In like manner <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> concludes the feast" (Apol., xxxi). <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian archaeology</a> has collected a large number of cup-bases on which may be read a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, e.g. "Drink in Christ", "Drink piously", "To the worthiest of friends, drink and live with all thine and in thy turn make a toast".

<p>One of the most ancient formulae of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at meals is found in a treatise of the fourth century, attributed without foundation to Saint Athanasius. Having made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> followed: "We give Thee thanks, our Father, for the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> which Thou hast manifested to us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Thy Son; and even as this bread which is here on this table was formerly scattered abroad and has been made compact and one, so may Thy Church be reunited from the ends of the earth for Thy Kingdom, for Thine is the power and glory for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." Apart from its intrinsic interest this formula possesses a certain importance because it reproduces in part the formula of the "Didache". The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said on raising from table is a little longer: <blockquote> The merciful and compassionate Lord has given nourishment to those who fear Him. Glory be to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and forever and throughout the ages. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whose name is above all things, we give Thee thanks and praise Thee because Thou hast deigned to give us a portion of Thy goods and nourishment for our body. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech Thee to give us in like manner heavenly nourishment. Make us fear and reverence Thy law and Thy terrible and glorious name, and grant that we may never disobey Thy <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. Write in our hearts Thy law and Thy <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Sanctify our mind, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and our body through Thy dear Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ Our Lord</a>. To Whom with Thee belongs glory, dominion, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and adoration for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </blockquote>

<p>It is not difficult to find examples in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, in the collections of canons, and in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, notably in the Gelasian Sacramentary and the Bobbio Sacramentary (Muratori, "Liturgia Romana vetus", I, col. 745; II, col. 949).

<p>In the Roman Liturgy the Benedicite and the Graces are compositions in which Psalms <a href="../bible/psa149.htm">149</a> and <a href="../bible/psa033.htm">33</a> are utilized, several versicles being omitted. From the most ancient times <a href="../bible/psa033.htm">Psalm 33</a> has been pre-eminently the communion psalm. At the midday meal <a href="../bible/psa001.htm">Psalm 1</a> is recited, in the evening <a href="../bible/psa116.htm">Psalm 116</a>. The origin of these formul&aelig; is monastic, hence the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> commemorations of benefactors.

<p>On the chief <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> feasts: <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, etc., a selection of verses recalling the solemnity of the day is substituted for the formul&aelig; in use at ordinary times. See also THANKSGIVING.
