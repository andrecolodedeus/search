<h1>Graf von Frankenberg</h1>  

<p>JOHANN HEINRICH, GRAF VON FRANKENBERG.

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> (Malines), <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; b. 18 September, 1726, at Gross-Glogau, Silesia; d. at <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Breda</a>, 11 June, 1804. He belonged to an ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> devotedly attached to the House of Hapsburg, and which remained so after the conquest of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1740). Although he was the sole male heir of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and assured of the protection of the <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a>, he decided, when quite young, to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He attended the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of his native city, went later to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and thence to the German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he obtained the degrees of Doctor of Theology, and of Canon Law, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 10 August, 1749. On his return to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, he was made coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> in Carniola (1750-54), dean of the collegiate church of All Saints at Prague (1754), later of that of Sts. Cosmas and Damian at Alt-Bunzlau in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1756), an finally <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the Austrian Low Countries on 27 May, 1759. In this exalted post, as in those which he had previously occupied, his life was an example of every private and public <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It was not long before he was called on to defend the dignity and independence of his office against the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, which, even under <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, was foreshadowing the petty tyranny of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. Despite his great devotion to <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, he more than once resisted the improper exactions of her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, who wished him to grant <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> according to their pleasure, and interfered in the most annoying manner in matters that pertained exclusively to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. He enjoyed, however, the personal favour of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, who sought to have him made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and in 1778 exerted herself to the uttermost to obtain for him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. The situation changed with the accession of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, a disciple of the "philosophers" and imbued with the principles of an "enlightened despotism". This emperor began that politico-ecclesiastical system, known as Josephinism, which meant substantially the absolute supremacy of the State. Each imperial encroachment on the inalienable <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was opposed by Frankenberg with commendable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and yet in a gentle manner and with such respect for the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> brought upon himself the bitter reproaches of such unflinching zealots as the ex-Jesuits, <a href="../cathen/06034a.htm">Feller</a> and Dedoyar. His protests, however, were met by the Government in an ill-humoured and disdainful way. It affected, indeed, to pay no attention to them. The most serious of the conflicts was that which broke out with regard to the General Seminary, founded at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1786 by the emperor, and to which he ordered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to send their students, closing at the same time their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching of the professors in this new institution, and the avowed purpose of using it as an instrument of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform and a weapon against "ultramontanism", soon provoked among the students an agitation that ended in a general dispersion. The irritated emperor, forthwith, summoned the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to intimidate him by means, as he wrote to <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a>, "of those vigorous and unanswerable arguments of which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so well how to make use". Ill, bereft of his advisers, threatened with indefinite detention at a great distance from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; reared, moreover, in those principles of respect for the sovereign power, which to us seem so exaggerated, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> consented to sign a rather equivocal declaration, in which he stated that he was convinced of his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to conform to the imperial decrees "relative to the General Seminary", but reserved to himself the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appeal to the emperor in cases where the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> appeared to him to be imperilled.

<p>On his return to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, Frankenberg regained his former energy. He felt himself upheld by the ardent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit of the nation, and announced to the Government that his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> would not permit of him to concur in the establishment of the General Seminary. Despite all threats, he thenceforth remained firm. The emperor called on him to express on his opinion on the doctrines then taught at the General Seminary, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> condemned that teaching in his "Declaration" &#151; a document which created a profound impression throughout <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The country was already disturbed by insurrectionary movements, and the Government was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to close the General Seminary. It was too late, however, to repress the rebellious agitation. The Government sought, therefore, to make the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> responsible for it, and wished to place him under arrest. From his place of refuge, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> protested against the accusation: "I take heaven and earth to witness", said he, "that I have had no share or influence whatever in this insurrection. The entire <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> will bear witness to this fact and do me <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in this respect." The Government, finding it to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to abandon the criminal process it had begun against the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, exhibited a conciliatory temper. In the meantime, however, the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> broke out. The new administration found him friendly, and he was henceforth officially a member of the States-General. At the same time he held aloof from purely political discussions and confined himself to recommending political union. He received with submission and respect the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, to which he had always been attached. On the arrival of the French he had to undergo new trials. He refused the pension which the Government wished to grant him in compensation for the suppression of his revenue, declared his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> exacted of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and was finally brutally expelled from <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (1797). He retired to Emmerich in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, where, aged, sick, and poor, he lived on the charity of his flock, and continued to warn them against those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who had taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. His apostolic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and his constancy in these trials elicited solemn eulogies from both <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. In deference to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> request and to render possible the execution of the concordat, he resigned, 20 November, 1801, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. Driven from Emmerich by the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> at the instance of the French Government, which affected to regard him as a conspirator, he retired to Borken in the territory of M&uuml;nster (1801), and, after the suppression of this principality, to <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Breda</a>, where he died. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, self-abnegation, and patience in the face of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and adversity make him one of the noblest figures of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> episcopate during the eighteenth century.
