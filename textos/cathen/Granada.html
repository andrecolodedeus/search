<h1>Granada</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> of Granada (Granatensis).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, founded by St. Cecilius about the year 64, was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, 23 Jan., 1493. The history of this city, the long line of its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (uninterrupted until the twelfth century and restored in 1437), its illustrious men, and its famous monuments can hardly be summarized within the limits of this brief article. In the Roman period this city appears as Municipium Florentinum Eliberritanum. On its Iberian <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, minted in the Roman republican period, the city is called Ilurir; on Latin <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, Iliber and Florentia; on <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, Iliberri, Eliberri, and Liberri. Pliny calls it Eliberri; Ptolemy, <em>Illiberis</em>; Herodioan, <em>Illiber</em>. Oler&oacute;n and Elna, on the other side of the Pyrenees, were similarly called; the name seems derived from the Basque language, in which <em>iri-berri</em>, or <em>ili-berri</em>, signifies "new town". In the eighth century, under <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> domination, this name was changed to <em>Granada</em>, originally the name of that particular quarter of the city inhabited since the third century by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Musselman</a> conquerors entrusted the custody of the city; it is worthy of note that several Palestinian peoples in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are called <em>Rimmon</em>, "pomegranate" (in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> <em>granada</em>).

<p>The famous codex of San Millan (St. Emilian), written in the tenth century, and now preserved in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> Library, supplies us with a catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Elliberis, sixty-two in number, from St. Cecilius to Agapius (64 to 957). The names of many of these and the periods of their reigns are also established by the Acts of councils, by their own writings, and by other authors, native and foreign. St. Cecilius, whose feast was kept by the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> and Mozarabic Church on 1 May, was one of the seven Apostolic men sent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to preach the Gospel in Hispania Baetica, where they suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. On 15 May, 301, the famous synod known as the Council of Elliberis assembled at Granada (see <a href="../cathen/05395b.htm">COUNCIL OF ELVIRA</a>), forty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being present, among them, besides Flavian of Granada, the great <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a>, Liberius of <a href="../cathen/10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a>, Melantius of Toledo, Decentius of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and Valerius of Saragossa. The eighty-one canons of this council reflect the state of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and church discipline in a time when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and antagonism were aroused by Roman imperial authority, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and schismatics. St. Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Elliberis, who assisted at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> and <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, and was the constant antagonist of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a>, bears witness to the purity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which this see always maintained. Bishop Stephanus (Esteban) assisted at the Third Council of Toledo (589), which extinguished the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Bishop Bisinus at the Second of Seville (619); Bishop Felix at the Fourth of Toledo (633); the signatures of successive Bishops of Elliberis in later councils attest the accuracy of the aforesaid San Millan catalogue. In 777 Bishop Egila was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by letters of praise from <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>. St. Leovigild, who, in the year 852, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, was a native of Granada; and, not long after (858), the See of Granada was occupied by the wise Recesmund, memorable for his <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> and literary achievements, as well as his embassies on behalf of Abd-er-Rahman III, Caliph of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, to the Emperors of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and of Constantinople. It was to him that <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand</a> dedicated his history of the kings and emperors of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>The See of Granada remained inviolate until the middle of the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> (Mozarabic) population having called to their aid Alfonso the Fighter (<em>el Batallador</em>), King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and Navarre, and conqueror of Saragossa, he led his hosts within sight of Granada; but the expedition being defeated, some of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> departed with the king, and the Almohades carried off the remainder by force to Marrucos. Thenceforward the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population consisted of captives and foreigners, and no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> held the title of Granada. <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>, in his "Series Episcoporum", makes St. Pedro Pascual (d. 6 Dec., 1300) a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Granada in the second half of the fourteenth century, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which has been corrected since the publication of the "Regesta" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (Paris, 1884). The new list of Bishops of Granada begins 13 Sept., 1437, and continues until 1492, according to the researches of Eubel in the Vatican registers.

<p>With the surrender of the city to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella (2 Jan., 1492), began a period of splendour for the See of Granada. A few days after that event, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns there ratified with <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a> the compact which was to result, before the end of that year, in the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. On 30 Jan. they issued the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of expulsion against all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> inhabiting their dominions in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>It is to be noted that the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Granada, the queen's confessor, transferred from the <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">See of Avila</a>, was not hostile to <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, but his constant friend, as Don Antonio Sanchez Moguel, Member of the (Spanish) Royal Academy of History, has promised to demonstrate. In this modern period of more than four centuries' duration, Granada has been ruled by many <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> eminent for learning and virtue, e.g. Cardinal Gaspar de Avalos, who founded the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (1531), Pedro Guerrero, a distinguished member of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and Manuel Bonel y Orbe, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Indies; it has given birth to innumerable writers, among whom the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Luis de Granada</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Francisco Su&aacute;rez are conspicuous; it was the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Order of St. John of God</a>. Indeed, it has long been a centre of vigorous spiritual life, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which is abundantly furnished by its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, its conventual buildings, and the vast material resources there devoted to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Ferdinand and Isabella, and the Empress Isabella, wife of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. Early in the present century, that famous monument of Spanish art, the Cartuja (Chartreuse) of Granada, from which its austere <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> had been driven by the barbarous <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of exclaustration (1835), was acquired and restored by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who have established in it their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for New Castile, Estremadura, and Andalusia, also a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, and a seismological and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory which publishes a periodical bulletin highly valued in scientific circles both in the Old and the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>.
