<h1>Gratian</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor; son of Valentinian I; born at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, 359; died at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 383. Before he had attained his ninth year he received the purple robe and diadem, with the title of Augustus; and on the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (375) he became Emperor of the West. His half-brother, <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a>, an infant, was associated with him in the title. He fixed his residence at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and devoted himself to opposing the advance of the Alamanni, whom he routed in the great battle of Colmar (378). His colleague in the east, <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, was, however, defeated and slain by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in the same year at the battle of <a href="../cathen/01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>. Gratian, feeling himself unequal to the task of governing the whole empire alone, assigned the eastern portion to <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>. Up to this time he had shown himself to be a wise ruler and a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> and skilful general, but now he began to neglect his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and to devote himself to hunting and other sports. A rebellion which arose in Britain under Maximus, one of his generals, spread into Gaul. Gratian, who was residing at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, fled to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and was there treacherously slain (25 Aug., 383). Gratian's reign marks a distinct epoch in the transition of the empire from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. At the time of his accession (375) he refused the insignia of pontifex maximus, which even Constantine and the other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors had always accepted. At the instance of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, who became his chief adviser, he caused the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Victory to be removed from the senate house at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (382). In this same year he abolished all the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> pontiffs and the grants for the support of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship. Deprived of the assistance of the State, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> rapidly lost influence. Gratian did not go so far as to confer upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the privileges and emoluments which he took from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, but he gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> by undoing the effects of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and by taking measures for the suppression of various forms of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Though in general his policy was one of toleration, he made apostasy a crime punishable by the State (383). It was for Gratian that St. Ambrose wrote his great treatise "De Fide".
