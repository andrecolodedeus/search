<h1>Great Falls</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF GREAT FALLS (GREATORMENSIS).

<p>Created by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>, 18 May, 1904; comprises the following counties in the <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">State of Montana</a>: Carbon, Cascade, Chouteau, Custer, Dawson, Fergus, Park, Rosebud, Sweet Grass, Valley, and Yellowstone. It is in the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">State of Montana</a>, U. S. A.; total area is 94,158 square miles.

<p>The titular city, Great Falls, is most appropriately named, as the Missouri River at this point falls 533 feet in a series of cascades, giving an equivalent of 340,000 h.p., and thus ranking next to Niagara, both in scenic beauty and mechanical value. This cheap power is utilized by large manufacturing plants &#151; flour mills, plaster mills, iron works, smelting and reduction works, etc. The annual output of one smelter alone is over 100,000,000 pounds of copper, with large quantities of silver and lead as by-products. Over 5,000,000 acres of rich farmland are tributary to the city; 1,000,000 acres being irrigated by the U.S. Reclamation Service and private enterprises. The region adjacent to the city is also rich in minerals &#151; copper, sapphires, gold, silver, lead, iron, gypsum, limestone, and bituminous coal (the output of this last for 1907 being 1,240,000 tons). Besides its importance as a manufacturing centre, Great Falls ranks next to Butte as most populous city in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, and is generally regarded as pre-eminently the home city of the Rocky Mountain region.

<p>In the year 1850 <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet, S.J.</a>, and his companions were the first missionaries to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> in the territory now covered by the Diocese of Great Falls. This notable event took place at Fort Benton, the head of navigation of the Missouri River, 2600 miles from its junction with the Mississippi. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> established missions to the Indians in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> as early as 1841, and most of these missions are still in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. At St. Peter's Mission, which is now the mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Order of <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, 2732 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of Indians were recorded in the Baptismal Register from 1855 to 1879. The early missionaries made many converts among the different tribes of Indians, and established among the white settlers a healthy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influence the effects of which are still noticeable. The non-Catholics are respectful, and most generous in contributing towards the erection of churches and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are well represented in different sections, in the social, commercial, and professional life if the community. The Very Rev. Mathias Clement Lenihan, vicar forane and missionary <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, of Marshalltown, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Great Falls, 20 May, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 21 September, 1904, at Raphael's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>. He was born 6 October, 1854, at <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, U. S. A., was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at St. Joseph's College, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, where he was a charter student, and at St. John's College, Prairie du Chien, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and made his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the Grand Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 21 December, 1879. Bishop Lenihan was the first native of the <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">State of Iowa</a> to be raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. His first appointment was at Vail; his second, at Marshalltown, where he built, besides a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and church, the St. Thomas Hospital in memory of his, brother, the late Rt. Rev. Thomas M. Lenihan, D.D., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a>. Immediately after his installation Bishop Lenihan devoted his energies to temperance reform, to the installation of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system, and to the erection of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The fine cut-stone edifice which now serves as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Great Falls was completed and dedicated, 15 December, 1907, to <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, the mother of the Blessed Virgin. Two more churches are now building at Great Falls, as well as a large <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans'</a> home that will be conducted by the Sisters of Charity of Providence, who also have charge of Columbus Hospital and Maternity Home. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is in a prosperous condition, both spiritually and materially. New <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are being created and new churches are being erected in nearly every city.
