<h1>Greek Catholics in America</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> churches of the Byzantine or <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> were almost unknown to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> some twenty-five years ago [1884]. Occasionally a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of that rite from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> came to America to ask assistance for his people who were struggling amid the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, but while his visit was a matter of curiosity, his rite and the peoples who followed it were wholly unknown to American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Today, however, emigration has increased to such an extent and is drawn from so many lands and peoples that there are representatives of most of the Eastern rites in America, and particularly those of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. These have lately arrived in large numbers and have erected their churches all over the country. The chief races which have brought the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> with them to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are the various <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of Austro-Hungary, and they are now approaching such a position of material well-being and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development as to be reckoned with as one of the factors of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Other races have also brought the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> with them and established it where they have settled. The advent of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> really commenced about 1879-1880. Those of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> came from the north-eastern portion of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> monarchy, where they inhabited chiefly the northern and southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, which form the boundary line between Galicia and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The first of the new-corners were miners in the coal districts. During the troublous times in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, from 1871 to 1879, when the "Molly Maguires" terrorized the mining districts and practically defied the authority of the State, the various coal companies determined to look abroad for foreign labour to replace their lawless workmen, and so they introduced the Austrian <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> to the mining regions of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. His success in wage-earning induced his countrymen to follow, and the coal companies and iron-masters of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> were quick to avail themselves of the new and less costly labour. This was before any of the present contract labour <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were enacted. The <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> was willing to work for longer hours than the English-speaking labourer, to perform heavier work, and to stolidly put up with inconveniences which his predecessor would not brook. He came from a land in which he had originally been a serf (serfdom was abolished in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> in 1848, and in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1861), then a degraded poverty-stricken peasant with hardly anything to call his own, and it was no wonder that America seemed to offer him boundless opportunity to earn a living and improve his condition. At first he was a cheap man; but in the course of a very short time the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> became not a mere pair of strong hands, but a skilled worker, and as such he drove out his competitors, and his success drew still more of his countrymen across the sea. In the anthracite coal region of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> there were in 1880 but some 1900 <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>; in 1890, over 40,000; and in 1900, upwards of 81,000. The same proportion holds good of the bituminous coal-mining districts and of the iron regions in that and other states. Taking simply the past four years (1905-1908), the immigration of the Slovaks and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, both of the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rite, has amounted to 215,972. This leaves out of consideration the immigration (147,675) of the Croatians and Slavonians for the same period, though a considerable portion of them are also of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. These <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> brought with them their Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rites and practices, but they were illiterate, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, the poorest of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of the English language. Herding together in camps and settlements, and working like serfs at the most exhausting labour, they had but little opportunity to improve themselves or to learn the language, customs, and ways of the Americans around them, while both American and foreign-born <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> failed to recognize in them fellow-Catholics, and so passed them scornfully by, and the American of the older stock and anti-Catholic prejudices too often held them in supreme contempt. Yet as soon as they gathered some little substance and formed a. settled community they sent for their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. When these arrived, they, too, were often imbued with national and racial prejudices, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> too little of the English language and American <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and customs to initiate immediately the progress of their people, yet they created for them churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a branch of their native literature upon American soil, and gradually brought them into touch with the people around them. In this they were seconded by many <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who also followed their countrymen, and the result has been that the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> has now been established in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> much more solidly and with greater virility than it is in many of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in south-eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Other races and nationalities have also established themselves besides the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>; and there are in America also the Rumanians, the Syrians, and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> who follow the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. But the people who have been foremost and most enthusiastic inthe support of and devotion to their Oriental Rite are the so-called <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, a name used to designate the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> proper and also those Slovaks who are their immediate neighbours. In order to understand fully their position and relations in America, some of their history and peculiarities should be given.
<h2 id="section1">Ruthenian Greek Catholics</h2>

<p>The word <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> is derived from the later Latin <em>Ruthenia, </em>the former name for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and of course the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> might well be called Russians. Indeed, the present <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> declare that they are the original Russians, and that the present <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Russians owe their name and nation to the accident of successful conquest and assimilation. Their own name for themselves is <em>Rusini, </em>and it is probable that <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> was merely an attempt to put this word into Latin. The word <em>Rutheni </em>is first found in the writings of the Polish <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a>, Martinus Gallus (1190), and the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> historian, <a href="../cathen/13497a.htm">Saxo Grammaticus</a> (1203). The original word <em>Rusini </em>is derived from <em>Rus, </em>the abstract word for Russian fatherland or dwelling-place of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> people; and the English word "Russian" may therefore mean a derivative from the word <em>Rus, </em>as denominating the race, or it may mean a subject of the Russian Empire. The former is <em>russky </em>the latter <em>rossiisky, </em>in the Russian and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> languages, and hence, while the first word is translated either as <em>Russian </em>or <em>Ruthenian, </em>it carries no special reference to the Russian Empire. These people are also called "Little Russians" (an expression chiefly used for them in the Russian Empire), originally an allusion to their stature as contrasted with the Muscovites. Their language is known as <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> or Little Russian, and is spoken in Northern <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Galicia Bukowina, and in the Provinces of Volhynia, Podolia, Chelm, and Kiev in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. It is quite similar to the Russian language of the Russian Empire (sometimes called Great Russian), bearing about the same relation to it as Lowland Scotch does to English, or <em>Plattdeutsch </em>to German, and rather closer than Portuguese does to Spanish. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> (in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>) and Little Russians (in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>) use the Russian alphabet and write their language in almost the same orthography as the Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> of St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, but they pronounce it in many cases very differently, quite as the French and English might pronounce differently a word written the same in each language. This fact has led in late years to a recension of the Russian alphabet in Galicia and Bukowina by the governmental authorities, and by dropping some letters and adding one or two more and then spelling all the words just as they are pronounced, they have produced a new language at least to the eye. This isthe "phonetic" alphabet and orthography, and as thus introduced it differentiates the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> language of these provinces more than ever from the Russian. The phonetic system of orthography is still fiercely opposed at home and in America, and as an <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> governmental measure it is regarded by many as an effort to detach the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> from the rest of the Russian race and in a measure to Polonize them. This battle of the reformed phonetic spelling rages as fiercely in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Indeed the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> here has found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to issue his official documents in both the phonetic and the etymologic spelling (as the older form is called), so as to meet the views of both parties. The phonetic spelling has never been introduced among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and their section of the language is still written in the customary form, there and in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> there are also the Slovaks who live in Northern and North-western <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, close neighbours to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, who are Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and who speak a language almost like the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, yet similar to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>. It is written, however, with Roman letters, and the pronunciation follows the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> more than the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>. These people seem to have been originally <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, but became gradually changed and moulded by the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> and their language and for a long time wrote their language in the same manner as the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, however, are in the Austrian part of the empire, while the Slovaks are in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. They have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in large numbers, and are about equally divided between the Greek and Roman Rites. This again necessitates the publication of church matters, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> books, journals, etc., in the Slovak language. It illustrates the difficulties of the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> since they are likely to have in their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> (of the old and new orthographies), Slovaks, and even those who speak only Hungarian, having lost their <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tongue. It is no uncommon thing to find a Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> capable of speaking five languages: <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, Slovak, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a>, German, and English. It is these people as a whole who are comprehended under the term <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, although that term applies strictly to those speaking Russian and using the Russian alphabet. After the eleventh century the larger portion of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> fell away from the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Constantinople, while a minority continued faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and later many more returned to unity. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, therefore, made use of the ancient word <em>Ruthenian </em>to designate those Russians who followed the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in unity with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in order to distinguish them from the Northern Russians who adhered to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Later on, those Russians who joined the union under the Polish kings received the same name, and the word <em>Ruthenian </em>is today used exclusively to designate the Russians of Austro-Hungary, who are Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in contradistinction to the Russians of the Russian Empire, who are of the Greek Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.



<p>The language of the Mass and the other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services according to the Byzantine Rite is the ancient Slavonic <em>(staroslavianski), </em>and the Greek Liturgy was originally translated by Sts. Cyril and Methodius about the year 868, and it has remained substantially the same ever since. It is curious to notice that the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> language is much closer, both in spelling and pronunciation, to the church Slavonic than the present Russian language of St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. The letters in which the church books are printed are the Cyrillic, or <em>Kirillitsa </em>said to have been invented or, rather, adapted by St. Cyril from the Greek alphabet, together with some additional letters of his own invention. It consists of forty-three letters of archaic form as used in the church books, but has been altered and reduced in modern Russian and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> to thirty-five letters. In the year 879 <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> formally authorized the use of the Slavonic language forever in the Mass and in the whole liturgy and offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, and its use has been continued ever since by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the Orthodox (schismatic) Greeks of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> races. This is the language used in the <em>Sluzhebnik </em>(Missal), <em>Trebnik </em>(Ritual), <em>Chasoslov </em>(Book of Hours), and other church books of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in America.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Constantinople (1054) most of the Russians became estranged from the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. (See under <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">GREEK CHURCH</a>, Vol. VI, pp. 760-62.) In 1595 the Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lithuania and Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> determined to return to unity with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and held a council at Brest-Litovsk, at which a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of union was adopted, and where they chose two of their number, Ignatius Potzey and Cyril Terletzki, to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. They declared that they desired to return to the full <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> as it existed before the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Photius and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a>, so as to have in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> one united <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> again. No change in their rites or their calendar was required by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the whole of the ancient Greek Liturgy, service, and discipline (excepting a few <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days and practices) was to go on as before. In December, 1595, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> solemnly ratified the union of the two Churches in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Magnus Dominus". On 6 October, 1596, the union between the Eastern and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> was proclaimed and ratified in the Russian part of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. A large number of the Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> immediately went over to the union. In <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a> the Russian Bishop Zbiruiski led the way with his whole diocese, and his successor, Methodius Terletzki, was a valiant champion of the Uniat Church. This Greek Uniat Church even produced a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the Faith, St. Josaphat, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Polotzk, who was slain by the Orthodox partisans in 1633. In Galicia, however, the union was slower. While <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and congregations became <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a>, the Bishops of Peremysl and Lemberg stood out for nearly a century. But on 23 June, 1691, Innocent Vinnitzki, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peremysl, joined the union, and in 1700 Joseph Shumlanski, Bishopof Lemberg (it was afterwards restored to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> dignity by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1807), also took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. From that time till now the Russians on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains and on both sides of the River Dniester have been united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the southern side of the Carpathians the Russians also accepted the union. In the year 1636 Vassili Tarasovitch, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634a.htm">Munk&aacute;cs</a>, acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and for it he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and forced to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. But union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> could not be stayed by such means, and on 24 April, 1646, it was accomplished in the city of Ungvar by Peter Rostoshinski; the then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634a.htm">Munk&aacute;cs</a>, and George Yakusitch, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Agri (Erlau). These two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in solemn council, with sixty three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and confessed themselves Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> holding the Faith of Sts. Cyril and Methodius in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Since that time the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> people (including the Greek Slovaks) in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> have acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the visible head of the undivided <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> have continued to practise their ancient Greek-Slavonic rites and usages, and their forms of worship introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> seem strange to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> accustomed only to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and have made them objects of distrust and even active dislike, so that a few of the most salient differences may be pointed out, although a full statement will be found in the various articles on the Eastern rites, ceremonies, and vestments. The Mass itself is said in ancient Slavonic, the altar is separated from the body of the church by a high partition called the <em>iconostasis, </em>upon which the pictures of Christ and His Mother, as well as various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, are placed, and the vestments of the Mass are quite different. The stole is a broad band looped around the neck and hanging straight down in front, the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> is cut away at the front and closely resembles the Roman cope, and instead of the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> two broad cuffs are worn, while a broad belt takes the place of the girdle or <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>. Married men may be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; but <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must be <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a>, nor can a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> marry after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Priests impart the Sacrament of Confirmation to children immediately after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and Communion is given to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> under both forms, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> species being mingled together in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and administered to the communicant with a spoon. Organs are not used in their churches, and their church year follows the Julian Calendar, which is now thirteen days behind the Gregorian calendar in use in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Besides this, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> (and the Russian Orthodox likewise), display the so-called "three-armed" (or Russian)&nbsp;<img alt="Image" src="../images/06744aat.jpg" height=23 width=25>cross fashioned in this manner upon their churches and use it upon their <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-books</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and banners, as well as other objects. They make the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> in the reverse direction to the Roman method, and in their religious services the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are segregated from each other upon different sides of their churches.

<p>It is from these people, inhabiting Galicia, Bukowina, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population has come. Their earliest immigration to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> began in 1879, from the western portion of Galicia near the Carpathian Mountains, the so-called Lemkovschini, and then spread throughout the Galician and Hungarian sides of the mountains. At first it was hardly noticed, but it grew year by year, the earliest immigrants coming from Grybow, Gorlice, Jaslo, Neu Sandec, Krosno, and Sanok in Galicia, and from <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Szepes</a>, Saros, Abauj, and Ung in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, until finally the governmental authorities began to notice it. At the post offices in many of the mountain places in the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> portion of Galicia it was observed that the peasants were receiving large sums of money from their fathers, sons, or brothers in America. The news spread rapidly, the newspapers and officials taking it up, and so emigration was at once stimulated to the highest degree. Every year it has increased, and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are formed here to assist their newly-arrived brethren to find employment and to give information to those at home about America. It is impossible to tell exactly how many <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> and Slovak Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have come to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, because no statistics have been kept by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Government in regard to religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of immigrants, and not always accurate ones in regard to race or nationality. Still the immigration reports show that immigration from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> from 1861 to 1868 was annually in the hundreds; and from 1869 to 1879 it ranged from 1500 to 8000 annually; and in 1880 it suddenly rose to 17,000. From 1880 to 1908 the total immigration from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> amounted to 2,780,000, and about twenty percent of these were <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and Slovaks. Within the last four years (1905-1908) the immigration of the Slovaks and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> has amounted to 215,972. To this must be added the Croatians and Slavonians (117,695), a large proportion of whom are of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. It is estimated that there are at present in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> between 350,000 and 400,000 Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, including as such the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Slovaks and Croato-Slovenians. The largest number (over one-half) are in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, while New York, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> have each a very large number of them, and the remainder are scattered all through the New England and Western states. From the best information obtainable in advance of the coming census of 1910 their distribution is as follows:-- <center><table summary="Table" BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="389"> <tr> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="27%">Pennsylvania <br>New York <br>New Jersey <br>Ohio <br>Connecticut <br>Illinois <br>Massachusetts <br>Rhode Island <br>Missouri</td> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="18%">190,000 <br>50,500 <br>40,000 <br>35,500 <br>10,000 <br>8,000 <br>7,500 <br>1,500 <br>6,500</td> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="37%">Indiana <br>Minnesota&nbsp; <br><a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, Dakota, <br>Nebraska and&nbsp; <br>Montana, about <br><a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>,&nbsp; <br>Virginia and the&nbsp; <br>Southern States,&nbsp; <br>about</td> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="17%">6,000 <br>3,000 <br>&nbsp;

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> immigration had begun in considerable numbers, it was but natural that they should desire to establish a Church of their own rite. At Shenandoah, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> settlement had so increased that towards the end of 1884 they sent a petition to <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Sylvester Sembratovitch, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that a Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> might be sent to them to found a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> at that place. The petitioners promised to build a church for him if he were sent. In the following year (1885) Rev. Ivan Volanski, of the <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Diocese of Lemberg</a>, arrived in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the first Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to take up work among his people here. On his arrival he presented himself in Philadelphia with his letters but being a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he encountered great difficulty in being recognized as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in good standing. However, he proceeded to Shenandoah, where under great difficulties and discouragements he organized his congregation and for about a year celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and other services in a hired hall, for he was unable to obtain the use of the local Latin churches for Greek services. The matter of his regularity and his acceptance as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> was finally arranged through Cardinal Sembratovitch. Early in 1886 he completed at Shenandoah a little frame church dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, the first Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in America. He then organized there the first Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Society, that of St. Nicholas, built and organized &amp; small <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and then proceeded to form congregations and to found churches in other places where the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> were thickly settled. During his stay he organized congregations and started churches at Hazleton (1887), Kingston (1888), and Olyphant (1888) in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, at Jersey City, New Jersey (1889), and at Minneapolis, Minnesota (1889). Finding his <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> people without any reading-matter in their own language, he sent to Galicia for Russian type, and in the latter part of 1886 he obtained a few fonts from the Shevchenko printing office at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. He then commenced the publication in "phonetic" <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> of a small paper issued every two weeks at Shenandoah under the name of "America". This paper lived until about 1890, but got involved in the labour troubles in the mining districts which destroyed much of its usefulness. In the spring of 1887 the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> sent him another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Rev. Zeno Lakovitch (unmarried), and a lay teacher, Volodimir Semenovitch from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. Father Lakovitch laboured at <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a> and at Wilkesbarre, where he died a year later. In 1888 Rev. Constantine Andrukovitch was sent from <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, and, in addition to his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, he, with Father Volanski, undertook to establish a series of stores in several towns in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> to sell goods to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and thus avoid the enormous prices which the mining companies charged them. The business venture was unsuccessful, and, with other matters, it caused the recall of Father Volanski to Galicia. He remained there some time, then was sent as a missionary to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, where his wife died, when he returned to Galicia, where he was a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> until his death in 1905. This business venture also caused the suspension of Father Andrukovitch, who returned to Galicia in 1892. The next three Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> were Rev. Theophan Obushkevitch (of Galicia), Rev. Cornelius Laurisin, and Rev. Augustin Laurisin (of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>), who took up their missionary work energetically. The first two are still Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in this country. Since their coming there has been a constant accession of <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from Galicia and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and the building of churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> has gone on with increasing success. Even quite costly churches have been built. In Jersey City the old church has given way to a fine stone and brick church, which is an excellent specimen of Russian architecture, while at Homestead and Shamokin, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, there are quite costly churches erected. Many of the Greek churches are purchases from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> altered and rearranged for the necessities of their rite, while one or two are churches brought over from the schismatics. The first Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mass in New York City was celebrated in the basement of St. Brigid's church on Avenue A (which was put at the disposal of the Greeks by the late <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>), on 19 April, 1890, by the Rev. Alexander Dzubay, who is still in active <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work in America. This Greek congregation afterwards bought a church in Brooklyn (St. Elias, 1892), and there was no <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> church in Manhattan until the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George was opened in 1905. In February, 1909, the Greek Bishop Soter bought a <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Protestant Episcopal</a> church in Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, refitted it, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it as the Greek Cathedral of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception, and in the adjoining <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> house and rectory will also open a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of American <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. Of course many <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> settlements in various localities are too poor to build and maintain a church, nor are there just at present sufficient <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in America to attend to their spiritual needs. Still there are at present (1909) about 140 <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and there are also ten more new ones projected for waiting congregations. Their churches are distributed as follows:-- <center><table summary="Table" BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="281" > <tr> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="38%" HEIGHT="144">Pennsylvania New York <br>Ohio <br>New Jersey <br>Connecticut <br>Illinois <br>Massachusetts</td> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="11%" HEIGHT="144">80 <br>14 <br>12 <br>10 <br>4 <br>4 <br>4</td> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="39%" HEIGHT="144">Indiana <br>Missouri <br><a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a> <br>Minnesota <br>Rhode Island <br>Virginia</td> <td VALIGN=top WIDTH="13%" HEIGHT="144">3 <br>3 <br>2 <br>2 <br>1 <br>1</td> </tr> </table></center>

<p>Several of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are converts from the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. As has been said, men who are already married are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and so it naturally followed that married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were sent to America. While a married <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> seems repugnant to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, yet it is strongly adhered to by the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as vaguely a part of their nationality and Eastern Rite. All American Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> will hereafter be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> from <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a> candidates only, according to the provisions of the Apostolic Letter "Ea semper", which will be referred to later. The growing importance of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in America, the dissensions arising out of old-country political factions among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, which will be mentioned later on, and which occasioned serious interference with the normal growth of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and the increasing intensity of the efforts of the Russian Orthodox to detach the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in America from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and unity (see <a href="../cathen/06772a.htm">GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH IN AMERICA</a>) caused the Holy Father in 1907 to provide a Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for America. Previous to this (1902) the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had sent the Right Rev. Andrew Hodobay, titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and canon of the Greek <a href="../cathen/05484c.htm">Diocese of Eperies</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15483a.htm">Apostolic visitor</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in America, who examined the conditions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in all parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1906 with his report. The choice of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> fell upon the Right Rev. Stephen Soter Ortynski, a <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, hegumenos of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Paul, Michaelovka, Galicia. On 12 May, 1907 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04638b.htm">Daulia</a> by the Most Rev. Andrew Roman Ivanovitch Scheptitzky, Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, and the other Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Galicia, and he arrived in America on 27 August, 1907. Shortly after his arrival (September, 1907) the Apostolic Letter "Ea semper", concerning the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> his powers and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and the general constitution of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in America was published. It created considerable dissatisfaction among the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> inasmuch as it did not provide for any <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> power or authority for the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but placed him as an auxiliary to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and as it modified several of their immemorial privileges in various ways. The Sacrament of Confirmation was thereafter to be withheld from infants at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and was not to be conferred by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but was reserved for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> only (as in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> and among the Greeks in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), and married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were not thereafter to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in America or to be sent thither from abroad, while the regulations as to the marriage of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the two rites were also modified. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Greek Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> saw in it an attack upon their <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> nationality and Eastern Rite, an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> eagerly fostered and magnified. They were told by the Orthodox that the whole letter was a latinization of their <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in regard to confirmation and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and was a nullification in America of the Decrees of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> that their rite should be kept intact. This resulted in some losses (about 10,000) from the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> to the Russian Church, but already many of them are coming back. Matters, however, adjusted themselves, and the work of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is having good results. The whole matter of a Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in America is so far in an experimental stage, and it rests upon the extent of the current and future immigration, the stability and solidarity of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in their adherence to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and rite, as to what powers and authority their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall ultimately have. Where there is an evident and actual need for it the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has always granted the erection of Oriental <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but where a minority of a population seems bound to become assimilated with, and eventually absorbed into, the surrounding population the case may be entirely otherwise. The newly appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has had success in establishing churches and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in inducing his <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> flock to become American citizens and identify themselves with American life while not abandoning their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and their Eastern Rite. He aims to establish English-Ruthenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in each Greek <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and to open a <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> American <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Philadelphia for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of American-born <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. There is already one American-Ruthenian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, lately <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. In purely <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matters they will be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> as in Latin <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, if not actually sent there for lectures, but in the Oriental church rites, discipline, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language, music, and customs the proposed <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> will fill a place for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> which our present <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> do not fill. The number of church or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> is about fifty, where instruction in English, <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, church <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, and the elements of a general <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is given. No organized Sunday-school system has as yet been established amongst them, nor are there any <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> or religious engaged in teaching in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>In order to understand somewhat clearly the situation of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in America, account must be taken of their national home politics, which they bring with them and fight out often quite bitterly in this country. As already said, they are from the northern and southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains. The northern <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> derisively call their southern brethren "Hungarians" <em>(Madyari), </em>while the latter return the compliment by calling the former "Poles" <em>(Poliaki). </em>The point of this lies in the fact that each of the nationalities named is cordially detested by the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> on either side. But these are merely surface divisions between the two bodies of the same race. Their actual factional differences are much deeper. There may be said to be, broadly speaking, three <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> parties or factions in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>: (1) The <em>Moscophiles, </em>or <em>Moskalophiles (Moskal </em>is the Little Russian word for a Great Russian), who aim at an imitation, if not an actual adoption, of all things Russian as found in the present Empire of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> looking towards <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> as the seed and kernel of Russian or <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> development, and who are strong supporters of Panslavism; (2) the <em>Ukraintzi, </em>or <em>Ukrainians </em>(the Ukraine is the adjoining border-land provinces of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Galicia), who stand for the interests of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> people in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and of the Little Russians in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, as distinct and apart from the Great <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, and who desire to develop the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> (Little Russian) language, literature, and race along their own lines, entirely distinct and apart from that of the present-day Russian Empire; and (3) the <em>Ugro-russki, </em>or Hungarian <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, who keep all the old Russian racial traditions, reverencing their Russian language, literature, and ancestry as models to follow in their development, but at the same time refusing to follow the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and St. Petersburg in such development, either in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The first two parties are Galicians, the last one Slovaks and Hungarian <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. These parties are sometimes divided into smaller factions, perplexing for an outsider to understand, such as those who desire to introduce the Hungarian language and customs, even using Hungarian in the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is needless to say that none of these larger parties ever agree upon any one subject other than their <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> nationality and <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. The Moscophiles often unite with the Greek Orthodox and Russian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> upon the slightest pretext when Russo-Slavic ideals are to be proclaimed, and are fiercely against everything that does not look Russiaward, for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is their big brother. On the other hand the Ukraintzi will have nothing to do with modern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; it is behind the age and lags in the march of civilization; and they have besides offended both the other parties by adopting the "phonetic" style of spelling. This offence seems to be intensified because the new Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is somewhat of their way of thinking. The Ugro-russki are <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> opposed to whatever does not accord with the racial views and traditions of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> and Slovak people within the borders of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and do not agree with the views and actions of either of the other two parties. Consequently, the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has to publish his official communications in <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, both phonetic and old-style, and in Slovak, in order to reach all his people.

<p>Of course these Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of such varied views have organized into <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. Each church has its own local religious and singing <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, but there are other and larger bodies known as "brotherhoods" or lodges <em>(bratstva), </em>which have been of great assistance in building up the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> churches. They are usually of the nature of mutual benefit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, assist in finding work, helping in religious matters and the like, having always the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> race as their main inspiration. Some of them provide that their members must show that they have made their <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> communion or forfeit membership, and provide for the dropping of a member when he ceases to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. These brotherhoods or lodges are combined into a general federation or union which takes in the whole <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. It has its annual convention composed of delegates from the various brotherhoods and always has some well-known Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as its <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. The largest and oldest of these federated <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> is the "Soyedineniya Greko-Kaftolicheskikh Russkikh Bratstv" (Russian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union), which was founded in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> in February, 1892. It is almost wholly composed of Slovaks and South-Carpathian <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. It now (1909) has 542 brotherhoods and 22,490 members, and has besides a junior organization for young people in which there are 163 brotherhoods and 5400 members, and is in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> in every way. It also publishes a weekly Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper at Homestead, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> &#151; the "Amerikansky Russky Viestnik (American Russian Messenger), printed both in the Russian and the Slovak languages. In <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> politics it is the representative of the Ugro-russki party. The second of these federations is the "Russky Narodny Soyus" (Russian National Union), which was founded in 1894 and is a Galician offshoot from the preceding <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. It is chiefly composed of Galicians who are Ukrainians, and who express themselves strongly against the Russian Empire and the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. It now has 249 brotherhoods and 12,760 members, and it likewise publishes a weekly newspaper, the "Svoboda" (Liberty), which is printed in New York City, in "phonetic" Little Russian. The third of these federations is the "Obshchestvo Russkikh Bratstv" (Society of Russian Brotherhoods), which was founded 1 July, 1900. It is composed almost wholly of Galicians of the Moscophile party, and a small minority of its membership is also made up of Galicians who are either Greek Orthodox or of Orthodox proclivities, for it is quite pro-Russian and opposed to the Ukrainians. It has now 120 brotherhoods and 6530 members, and publishes its weekly newspaper, Pravda (Truth) at Olyphant, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> old-style spelling. There is also the "Rimsko a Greko Katolicka Jednota" (Roman and Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union) of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> organization which has some 175 brotherhoods and about 9000 members, and it is estimated that about one-third of these are Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. This federation also publishes a weekly paper, "Bratstvo" (Brotherhood) in the Slovenian language. Besides these publications there is also the "Dushpastyr" (The Pastor), published in New York which is exclusively a religious periodical and devoted solely to the affairs of the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in America. In it the official utterances of the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are usually published. There are also many other American <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> papers and periodicals which have nothing whatever to do with church matters, but are devoted to labour questions, national issues, and to Socialism. Unfortunately, many of these publications, even the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ones, exhibit too much of a tendency to attack their opponents in strong language and to belittle the efforts of those not of their party, and their usefulness for good is thereby lessened. From time to time various religious works and a number of booklets on church and national topics have been published in Slovak and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, and every year there are issued a number of year-books or <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> containing a variety of information and illustrations concerning the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in America and abroad.

<p>The immigration of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and the organization of their churches and rite has been too recent to properly speak by name of any distinguished representatives of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Nearly everyone who took a prominent part in their settlement and development is still alive and engaged in active work, while a vigorous younger generation born on American soil is now growing up. Among the Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> here in America are several who are authors of learned works upon the church language and ritual, others who have filled posts of considerable distinction in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and Galicia whence they came, and many who have constantly employed their tongue and pen in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and improvement of their fellow-countrymen in this country. There is, however, no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, nor an association whatever of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> devoted to church service in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> nor has any attempt been made so far, either on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, to establish here anything of the kind.

<p>In addition to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> there are a large number of them in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. They are principally settled in the provinces of <a href="../cathen/09602a.htm">Manitoba</a>, <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Alberta</a>, and Saskatchewan, where they have devoted themselves to agricultural pursuits. It is said that a <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> often works hard in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> saves up his money, and emigrates to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where he can obtain cheap land under the homestead acts. There is besides a considerable direct immigration from Galicia and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, but the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> are Galicians. Their first church (St. Nicholas) in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was built about 1900 at Winnipeg by the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who are in charge of the Greek missions of the northwest. The Very Rev. Platonides Filas, O.S.B.M., who is now (1909) the superior of the order in Galicia, was the first missionary sent there. Afterwards, in 1905, another church (St. Josaphat) was built at Edmonton. Later on a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was established in Winnipeg, with a branch at Monaster, Alberta. From these central points, there are now (1909) over sixty missionary stations established with small Greek <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> at Oaknook, Swan River, Barrows, Ethelbert, Garland, Grand View, Minatonas, Yorkton, Beaverdale, Rabbit Hill, Star, Lamont, Nundare, and Skaro. In this section the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> have to contend with the Russian Orthodox missions, which are well provided for, and with certain schismatics from the Russian Orthodox known as the "Seraphimites", or independent Gr&aelig;co-Russian Church. There are three missionary communities of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>: at Winnipeg, Edmonton, and Monaster. The Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> consist of eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and four <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is between 45,000 and 50,000, widely scattered through these northwest territories. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a> (14 in number), whose mother-house is in <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, Galicia. They have <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Winnipeg, Edmonton, Monaster, and in some outlying districts. The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> publish a small paper (Canadian Farmer) and have several <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> on the pattern of those in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Rumanian Greek Catholics</h2>

<p>These people come from the eastern provinces of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> known as <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. They are of a nationality which claims to come down from the Roman colonists who were settled there by the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a>, and hence they still call themselves <em>Romani.</em> These <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvanians</a> are really of an older political order and settlement than the independent country known as Rumania, which bounds <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> on the east. The inhabitants of both lands are of the same stock, but those in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> were organized and in possession of a fair amount of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> under Hungarian rule whilst the present Kingdom of Rumania was still oppressed under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> rule. The latter only obtained its independence after the Russo-Turkish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1878, and in turn began the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and enlightenment of its people. The Rumanian language is a Latin tongue, some-what similar to Italian, but with a considerable mixture of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a>, Greek, and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> words in it. It is also the language of the Mass and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices according to the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> among the Rumanians, and is an instance where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has made a modern tongue the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language. Owing to Slavonic influences, the Rumanian language was formerly written in Slavonic or Russian characters, and this continued until about 1825, when the Roman alphabet was adopted, first by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rumanians and then by the Orthodox, and it has been used for the Rumanian language ever since. Even for church books the Slavonic letters (the Cyrillic alphabet) had to give way to the Latin letters, just as the Slavonic Liturgy in the church services had given away to the Rumanian, and now both the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the Orthodox Mass-books and Office-books are printed beautifully in Latin letters and modern Rumanian, whether for use in the churches of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> or Rumania. The Rumanian Church, although Greek in rite, was originally under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> up to the ninth century, when Constantinople assumed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over it, and later on, when Constantinople fell into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the Rumanian Church went with it. Frequently, however, during the centuries that followed, partially successful attempts were made towards reunion. At the time of the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> endeavoured to persuade a portion of the Rumanian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and their flocks to embrace the new doctrines. This naturally led to an examination of matters wherein the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> differed from the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, and also to the points wherein it was in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and later to a desire for union with it. The union of the Rumanian <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (for the other Rumanians were subjects of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>) with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> dates from 1700. The preliminaries for union had been in progress for several years before, and once or twice had been on the eve of success. In the year just mentioned the Metropolitan <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> held a general synod of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> at Alba Julia (Gyulyafehervar), which declared, on 5 September, 1700, that "freely and spontaneously moved thereto by the impulse of Divine Grace, we have entered upon a union with the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> church". This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was signed by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, 54 arch-priests, and 1563 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The act of union was confirmed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the following year, and the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was for a long time the only Greek <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. Towards the middle of the last century the Greek Orthodox Rumanian <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was also established. The Rumanian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are very proud of their union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and church documents are often dated not only by the year of our Lord <em>(pre anul Domnului), </em>but also by the year of the union <em>(pre anul de la santa unire).</em>

<p>The Rumanian immigrant does not seem to have begun to come to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> until about the beginning of the present century. In the year 1900 Rumanian immigration from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> and Northern <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> began to flow towards the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and lately has been followed by immigration from <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> itself. It has steadily increased until now (1909) there are between 60,000 and 70,000 Rumanians in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Nearly all these have come from <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; only a small minority are from the Kingdom of Rumania. Those from <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> are from the southern and western counties of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, chiefly the counties of <a href="../cathen/14419b.htm">Szatm&aacute;r</a>, Szilagy, <a href="../cathen/06123a.htm">Fogaras</a>, Bihar, and Temes. The Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> among them number about 45,000, and they are scattered through the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The chief places where the Rumanian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are settled are <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, Youngstown, <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a>, <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, and Cincinnati, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; Sharon, <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, Windber, and Scalp Level, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; Aurora, <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> Harbor, and Terre Haute, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>; <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton, New Jersey</a>; St. Louis, Missouri; and <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>. They are all quite poor and are generally found, like all recent immigrants, in the humblest and poorest walks of life. They lack sufficient missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own rite, and at present many additional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> would be welcome. The Rev. Dr. Epaminondas Lucaciu was the first Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rumanian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to come to this country. He was sent here in 1904 by the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09419a.htm">Lugos</a>, at the request of the late Bishop Horstmann of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, who was asked for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of their own rite by the Rumanians settled in <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>. When he came, he set about forming a congregation and building a church for his people of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. His energy and ability among his countrymen led to the erection and dedication, on 21 October, 1906, of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Helena in Cleveland &#151; the first Rumanian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in America. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> also led to the formation of congregations in other localities which he visited regularly. In 1908 the second Rumanian church was built and dedicated at Scalp Level, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, which serves as the central point for missionary work among the Rumanians of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. In 1909 the third Rumanian church was completed and dedicated at Aurora, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and it serves in its turn as the centre of Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> work among the Rumanians of the Western States. A fourth has just been constructed at Youngstown, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. There are now (1909) four Rumanian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and more are shortly expected to arrive. Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregations have been formed in many localities, and they are regularly visited by the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are here, and regular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> will be formed and churches erected as soon as possible. A Rumanian Greek <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is now in course of formation in New York City and awaits a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. While they have a small <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church paper "Catholic American", they also publish a fine eight-page weekly, "Romanul", at <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> and New York, which gives a great deal of church news, and they also publish a little monthly magazine and an illustrated year-book in which many details of their churches, <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and progress are given. The weekly paper was originally founded by Father Lucaciu to provide reading-matter and general news for his people, but it has since passed into other hands. Their <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are not strictly speaking church organizations, but are rather mutual benefit <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for Rumanians, and some even have a limited membership of the Orthodox, for the Rumanians of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, whether Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Greek Orthodox, are very closely united upon racial and national feelings, and do not exhibit the hostility sometimes shown between the two Churches elsewhere. The principal <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are "Dacia Romana", "Ardealana", "Unirea Romana", and "Societatea Traian", numbering altogether about 3000 members, and generally identified with the church congregations.
<h2 id="section3">Syrian (Melchite) Greek Catholics</h2>

<p>About 1886 the first immigration from the Mediterranean coasts of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> began to reach the shores of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, Greeks, and Syrians began to swell the numbers of our immigrants. Among them came the Syrian Greeks, or those Syrians who were of the Byzantine Rite, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Orthodox. The name <em>Melchite </em>(see under <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">GREEK CHURCH</a>, Vol. VI, p. 755), is occasionally used to designate a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> of the Greek Orthodox Faith, but now it rarely has that meaning, since the schismatics prefer to be known as Syro-Arabians, at least in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> where they are largely under Russian influence, for it is nearly always applied to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> followed the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> of Constantinople. When it separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they also gradually became separated, merely through inertia. Occasionally a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and there were sporadic attempts to reunite them with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Cyril V, who was elected <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> about the year 1700, decided to come back to unity and made his submission and profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a>, and his example was followed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. From that time on the Syrian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have had a restored <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> line of Patriarchs of Antioch. Strangely enough, the word <em>Melchite, </em>which had been used to designate those who adhered to the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople when it was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and in unity, and who even followed it when it left the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, came eventually to mean, after the union of Cyril V and his fellow-bishops, almost exclusively those Syrians of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> who were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and united with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Their rite, of course, is the same as that of the other Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but the language used in the Mass and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and in the church offices is the Arabic, with the exception of certain prayer-endings and versicles of the Mass, which are still intoned in the original Greek. Still a <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may celebrate entirely in Greek if he so desires, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is printed in parallel columns in each language as to the parts which are to be intoned or said aloud.

<p>At first these Syrians were in small numbers and were not distinguishable from the Arabic-speaking <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> or from the Syro-Arabian Orthodox Greeks, all of whom began to come to this country about the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. This Syrian immigration, as compared with that from other lands, has never been very large. The Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> came at first from the same localities as the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> &#151; Beirut and Mount Lebanon; but now they come from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and other parts of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> as well. In 1891 Rev. Abraham Bechewate, a <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Congregation of the Holy Saviour, from Saida in the Diocese of Zahleh and Farzul, Mount Lebanon, was sent to this country by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to take up missionary work among his countrymen. So far he has been instrumental in establishing missions and congregations in various cities and in having other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sent to assist him. His first efforts were confined to New York City, and at present the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> in New York City use the basement of St. Peter's church on Barclay Street, but they have bought ground in Brooklyn with a view to erecting a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church there. After Father Bechewate other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were sent to take up the work at various places throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. At the present time (1909) there are altogether fourteen <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> churches or congregations in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and just across the border in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Besides these there are many mission stations which the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> visit periodically. These churches are situated at the following places: New York City; <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> and Lawrence, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>; Omaha, Nebraska; Cleveland, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; Dubois and Scranton, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> and Joliet, Illinois; Rockley, <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>; La Crosse, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>; Pawtucket, Rhode Island; and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and Toronto, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. So far they have erected four fair-sized churches in Lawrence, <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, Dubois, and <a href="../cathen/08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>. The cost of land in the large cities has prevented them from building, so that their congregations in the other places are assembled either in the Latin churches or in rented premises. The number of the Syrian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (1909) is between 8000 and 10,000, and they are to be found chiefly in the New England States, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and Illinois. For their spiritual needs there are thirteen Syrian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seven of them <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Congregation of the Holy Saviour from the Diocese of Zahleh and Farzul, four of them <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Congregation of St. John (Soarite) from the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a> and Zahleh, and two <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Diocese of Beirut</a>. Owing to the poverty of most Syrian congregations, they have not maintained any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and have no Sunday-school instruction, and the majority of the Syrian children attend the nearest Latin <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, if there be one. They have a small Arabic paper "Al-Kown" (The Universe), published in New York City, and have the church <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of St. George.
<h2 id="section4">Italian Greek Catholics</h2>

<p>In the extreme southern part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in the Island of Sicily the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> has always flourished, even from Apostolic times. Three of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (5th. <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Agatho, and Zacharias) were Greeks from that region. Many of the Greek <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> or <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a>, and the great Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07040b.htm">Grottaferrata</a> near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a> in Calabria. The <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> never fell into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or separated from unity with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the time of the great Schism of Constantinople. Although they held to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and rite, yet the fact that they were not thereafter closely allied with their fellow-Greeks of Constantinople caused the followers of their rite to diminish. After the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> grew up among the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> that the Greek language and ritual were in some indefinable way identified with the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. This was intensified upon the failure of the Greeks after the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1428) to adhere to the union. Therefore, as the Greek language died out among the southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, they gradually gave up their <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> and adopted the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> instead. While the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> thus became gradually confined to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, and country towns, and would perhaps never have died out on Italian soil, yet it was reinforced in a singular manner by immigration from the Balkan peninsula in the period between 1450 and 1500. The Albanians, who were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and followed the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, using the Greek language in their liturgy, were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and, by reason of the many <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> victories over the Albanians under their chieftain, George Castriota, also known by his <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> name of Scanderbeg (Alexander Bey), were forced to leave their native land in large numbers. Scanderbeg applied to <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a> for permission for his people to settle in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, so as to escape the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> persecutions. From time to time they settled in Calabria and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and received among other privileges that of retaining their <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> wherever their colonies were established. Since that time they, like the Greek inhabitants of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, have become entirely Italianized, but, together with them, have retained their <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> quite distinct from their Latin neighbours down to the present day. All the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> who follow the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> are known as Albanese (Albanians), although only the elder generations of that race retain their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Albanian tongue. The Mass and all the offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are of course said in Greek according to the Rite of Constantinople, although a few Latinizing practices have crept in. The smaller churches do not have the <em>iconostasis, </em>priests de not confer confirmation, but it is given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and they follow the Gregorian calendar instead of the Julian calendar followed by all the other Greeks.

<p>When the immigration to America from the south of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> began in large proportions, the Italo-Greeks came also. They are from Calabria, Apulia, and Basilicata in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and from the Dioceses of Palermo, <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. They are settled in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> chiefly in New York, Philadelphia, and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and throughout the States of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and Illinois. It is claimed that the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> has sent a third of its number to America, and some well-informed Albanese have even declared that there are perhaps more. They estimate that there are 20,000 of them in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the greater part of whom are in the vicinity of New York and Philadelphia. As a rule they have not shown themselves in any wise as devoted church-attendants, but that may be because they have been in a measure neglected &#151; for everyone assumes that an Italian must be of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> and ought to go to a Latin church. They have neither the means to construct churches of their own rite nor do they care to frequent churches of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, although their <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> usually attend the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and celebrate their festivals according to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. In many places they attend the churches of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in some few instances some have gone to the Hellenic churches of the Greek Orthodox, where the language of the ritual is Greek. During the year 1904 the first (and so far the only) Italian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <em>Papas </em>(Rev.) Ciro Pinnola, was sent from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by Cardinal Celesia of Palermo to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, to look after the scattered flock of Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> here and he is now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Archdiocese of New York. He found that these <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, being accustomed to the language and rites of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, as well as infected by the inertia of so many of the newcomers to these shores, had not attended the Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, and that they had become the prey of all sorts of missionary experiments to draw them away from their allegiance to the Faith. Besides, they were among the poorest of the Italian immigrants and had been unable to establish or maintain a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> or church of their rite. He took energetic steps to look after them and on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>, 1906, had the pleasure of opening the first Italian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on Broome Street in the City of New York. This has progressed so far that he has now a larger missionary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (Our Lady of Grace) on Stanton Street, with a congregation of about 400, where the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> in the Greek language is celebrated. He has also various missionary stations in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> and on Long Island, which he visits at regular intervals, but he has been unable to do anything for the Italian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and elsewhere. Other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their rite are needed. There is a small <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in New York where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Catechism and Greek singing is taught, as well as several Italian and English branches, and children are instructed in their church <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. There is quite a large <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the "Fratellanza del Santissimo Crocefisso", a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for mutual benefit, religious instruction, and the building of an Italian <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek church</a>. There are some ten or twelve Italo-Albanese <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, having branches in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, but devoted mostly to secular objects. There is also a small weekly Italian paper, "L'Operaio", for the Italo-Albanese and their <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, but it is also devoted to Socialism and the wildest labour theories, so that its usefulness is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>.
