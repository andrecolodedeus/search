<h1>Greek Church</h1>  

<p>This subject will be treated under the following heads: <blockquote><p>I. Explanation of Terms; <br>II. The Greek Orthodox Church and Its Divisions; <br>III. Greek Uniat Churches; <br>IV. Greek-Church History, subdivided into: <br>(1) The First Five Centuries; <br>(2) Decay of the Greek Churches of the East and Rise of the Byzantine Hegemony (451-847); <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Internal Organization of the Byzantine Churches; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) The Emperor; Relations between East and West; Liturgy. <br>(3) The Greek Schism; Conversion of the Slavs (ninth to eleventh century); <br>(4) Efforts towards Reunion; the Crusades (eleventh to fifteenth century); <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Internal Organization; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Hesychasm. <br>(5) From 1453 to the Present Time &#151; Relations with the Catholic Church, the Protestants, etc.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Explanation of terms</h2>

<p>In the East, when a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is spoken of, four things must be kept distinct: the race to which the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belong; the speech used in their everyday life, and in their public <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotions</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> used in their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, and their actual <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or non-Catholic. It is because these distinctions have not been, and are not, even now, always observed that a great confusion has arisen in the terminology of those who write or speak of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern (Oriental) Churches</a> and of the Greek Church. As a matter of fact, the usual signification attached to the words <em><a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a></em> extends to all those Churches with a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rite differing from the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. Let them reject the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or accept it, they are none the less <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>. Thus the Russian Church, separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, is an <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>; in the same way the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who live in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and are known as <a href="../cathen/08206a.htm">Italo-Greeks</a>, make up an <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> also. The expression <em><a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a></em> is therefore the most comprehensive in use; it includes all believers who follow any of the six Eastern rites now in use: the Byzantine, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03559a.htm">Chaldean</a>, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, and Coptic.

<p>What, then, do we mean when we speak of the Greek Church? &#151; Ordinarily we take it to mean all those Churches that use the Byzantine Rite, whether they are separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or in communion with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whether they are by race and speech Greek or <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, Rumanians, Georgians, etc. The term <em>Greek Church</em> is, therefore, peculiarly inappropriate, though most commonly employed. For instance, if we mean to designate the rite, the term Greek Church is inaccurate, since there is really no <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> properly so called, but only the Byzantine Rite. If, on the other hand, we wish to designate the nationality of the believers in the Churches following the Byzantine Rite, we find that out of fifteen or twenty Churches which use that rite, only three have any claim to be known as <em>The Greek Church</em>, viz., the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Hellenic Kingdom, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. Again, it must be borne in mind that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople there are included a number of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, Rumanians, and <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albanians</a> who rightly refuse to be known as Greeks.

<p>The term <em>Orthodox Greek Church</em>, or even simply the <em>Orthodox Church</em>, designates, without distinction of speech, or race, or nationality, all the existing Churches of the Byzantine Rite, separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They claim to be a unit and to have the same body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which they say was that of the primitive Church. As a matter of fact, the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of these Churches is what we call <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>, since it rejects the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>, and the Papal Supremacy, the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, etc. However, by a polite fiction, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> give them the name of <em>Orthodox</em> which they have usurped. The term <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">Schismatic</a> Greek Church is synonymous with the above; nearly everybody uses it, but it is at times inexpedient to do so, if one would avoid wounding the feelings of those whose <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> is aimed at.

<p>The term <em>United Greek Church</em> is generally used to designate all the Churches of the Byzantine Rite in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church of Galicia, the Rumanian Church of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the Georgian Church, the Italo-Greek Church, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Greeks in Turkey or in the Hellenic Kingdom &#151; all of them <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> &#151; are often called the United Greek Churches. Again, the term is inappropriate, and belongs of right only to the last two Churches. As a matter of fact the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> are <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> who follow the Byzantine Rite, but use a Slavonic translation; whereas the Rumanians are Latins who follow the Byzantine Rite, but in a <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> translation, etc.

<p>Instead of <em>United Greek Church</em>, the term <em>Uniat</em> (or <em>Uniate</em>) <em>Church</em> is often used; and in like manner the word <em>Uniats</em> is used instead of <em>United Greeks</em>. These words are by no means synonymous. <em>Uniat Church</em>, or <em>Uniats</em>, has a much wider signification than <em>United Greek Church</em> or <em>United Greeks</em>, and embraces all the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but following another than the Latin rite, whether it be Byzantine, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, Chaldean, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, or Coptic. The <em>Uniat Church</em> is therefore really synonymous with <em><a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> united to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a></em>, and <em>Uniats</em> is synonymous with <em><a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a></em>.


<h2 id="section2">The Greek orthodox Church and its divisions</h2>

<p>The Greek Orthodox Churches are Churches separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and following the Byzantine Rite, i.e. the rite developed at Constantinople between the fourth and tenth centuries. In the beginning, the only language of this rite was Greek. Later, however (the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is uncertain), it was introduced among the Georgians, or Iberians, of the Caucasus and was translated into the Georgian vernacular of the country. In the ninth century, through the efforts of Sts. Cyril and Methodius and their disciples, the Moravians and the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and as the missionaries were <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> they introduced their own rite, but translated the Liturgy into <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a>, the mother tongue of those nations. From <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> this Byzantine-Slav Rite spread among the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> and the Russians. In recent times the Byzantine Rite has been translated into <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> for use by the faithful of that nationality. Lastly, the Orthodox Syrians of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have adopted a hybrid Byzantine Rite in which, according to the whim of the celebrant, either Greek or Arabic is used. Hence we have five divisions of the Byzantine Rite, and consequently five divisions of <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek</a> Churches: &#151; <ul><li><em>The Greek-Byzantine Rite,</em> which includes the pure Greeks subject <ul><li>to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, <li>to the Holy Synod of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, and <li>to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>.</ul> <li><em>The Arabic-Byzantine Rite,</em> which includes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> under the Patriarchates of <ul><li>Antioch, <li><a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <li>Alexandria, and <li>the Archbishopric of Sinai.</ul> <li><em>The Georgian-Byzantine Rite,</em> which, up to the beginning of the nineteenth century, included the Churches of the Caucasus Range now absorbed by the Russian Church and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use the Slavonic Liturgy instead of their own native Georgian. <br><li><em>The Slavonic-Byzantine Rite</em>, comprising <ul><li>the Russian, <li>the Servian, and <li>the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Churches.</ul> <li><em>The Rumanian-Byzantine Rite,</em> used by the Rumanian Churches.</ul>

<h3 id="A">Pure Greeks</h3>

<h4 id="i">Patriarchate of Constantinople</h4>

<p>This Church is governed by a patriarch, a Holy Synod consisting of twelve <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, and a mixed council of four <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and eight <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. It numbers in all 101 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, of which 86 have <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank, and 15 are suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Such were the official figures and were accurate until the month of October, 1908. As we write, however, this is no longer so. Since the proclamation of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> independence the five Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> in their country have been suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. Bosnia-Herzegovina had four <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> depending more or less on Constantinople, but since <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> has annexed that country they will no longer be dependent. Lastly, the Island of Crete is now almost independent of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, and in consequence its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and his seven suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have gone over to the Holy Synod of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. From the 101 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, therefore, we may deduct 17, viz., 10 <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> and 7 suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, which leaves a total of 84 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, 76 being <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and 8 suffragan. Of these 84 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, not including Constantinople, 22 are in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, 12 in the Archipelago, and 50 on <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> soil. For want of reliable statistics, it is difficult to form an estimate of their population. The Greeks in the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a> claim to number 6,000,000, but this figure is exaggerated. We shall be nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in computing 1,000,000 Greeks in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, 400,000 in the Archipelago, 1,500,000 in Turkey in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, including the Albanians and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. There are, moreover, 600,000 <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, either <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> or <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, who belong to the &oelig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. All this gives a grand total of 3,500,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In consequence of the independence of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, of the annexation of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a> by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, and the secession of Crete to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, the &oelig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> has recently lost nearly a million subjects &#151; namely, 700,000 in Bosnia, 200,000 in Crete, and from 70,000 to 80,000 in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>.

<h4 id="ii">The Church of Greece</h4>

<p>This Church dates back to 1833, when 36 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> proclaimed their independence of Constantinople and established a Holy Synod; its authority was not recognized until 11 July, 1850, by the &oelig;cumenical patriarch. At the present time this Church is controlled by a Holy Synod of five members: the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> as president and four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen in regular succession. The Hellenic Kingdom contains 32 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, of which one &#151; that of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> &#151; is a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>; it is not, however, rare to find one-third of the sees vacant for <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> reasons. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Greece numbers 2,500,000 members in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and many thousands of believers in other countries, especially in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. By an arrangement arrived at between Athens and Constantinople in 1908, all the Greek Churches of the dispersion, save that of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, must, look to Athens as their head.
<h4 id="iii">The Church of Cyprus</h4>

<p>Ever since the Council of Ephesus, in 431, recognized its autonomy, which was confirmed in 488 by the Emperor Zeno, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> has remained independent. The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> consists of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a> and his three suffragans, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, Cytion, and Cyrenia. Nearly ten years ago the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> died, and so far his successor has not been agreed on. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has about 200,000 adherents.
<h3 id="B">Arabic Byzantines</h3>

<h4 id="i">Patriarchate of Antioch</h4>

<p>The Orthodox population of this <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is hardly Greek any longer. They are a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> race whose speech is Arabic, and as a rule the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices are celebrated in Arabic. Since 1899 the Greek element, which had up to then monopolized the superior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> positions, has been definitively driven out of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The patriarch lives at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and governs with the aid of a Holy Synod and a mixed council. At the present time this Church has 13 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, all of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank, and numbers 250,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
<h4 id="ii">Patriarchate of Jerusalem</h4>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was cut off from that of Antioch in 451. If it were not for the sanctuaries of the Holy Places, which draw so many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and such considerable <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, its importance would be nil. All the superior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are Greek, and, in accordance with a rule made in the early part of the eighteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Syrian birth and Arabic speech are eligible for the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> positions only, although the whole membership of this Church is Syrian. There has been a revolt recently against this slavery, and it is not unlikely that before long the Greeks will be expelled from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as they have been already driven from Antioch. The only extant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and St. Jean d'Acre, but a number of titular <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> aid the patriarch in the administration of his Church. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages in use are Greek and Arabic; the number of subjects of this <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> cannot exceed 50,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
<h4 id="iii">Patriarchate of Alexandria</h4>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is made up of only one diocese under the personal care of the patriarch. According to decisions arrived at in 1867 he ought to be assisted by a Holy Synod composed of four members who were to be honorary Metropolitans of <a href="../cathen/11610d.htm">Pelusium</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, Pentapolis, and Lybia. This synod is being formed. Church-membership numbers about 80,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, made up mostly of strangers from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Greece, among whom far from harmonious relations prevail. The liturgy is celebrated in either Greek or Arabic, but for the most part in Greek.
<h4 id="iv">Archbishopric of Sinai</h4>

<p>The titular of this see has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Catherine and about fifty Bedouins. Its autonomy was proclaimed in 1575 and confirmed in 1782. At the present time the tendency is to consider it rather as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.
<h3 id="C">Orthodox Georgians</h3>

<p>The various national Churches of Iberia, Mingrelia, and Imerethia no longer exist since <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has extended her dominion over the Caucasus provinces. In the Liturgy the Georgian tongue has been replaced by the Slavonic. The number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was formerly twenty, but is now only four, all in the hands of the Russians. It has a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, with the title of Exarch of Georgia and three suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The number of the Orthodox in <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, including the Russian colonists, is reckoned at about 1,600,000.

<h4 id="i">The synodal Church of St. Petersburg</h4>

<p>This is but a continuation since 1721 of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, which had been established in 1589 by the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, Jeremias II, who up to that time had ruled the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The Holy Synod instituted by Peter the Great and composed of seven members, is the head of this Church. The Russian Church counts 63 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, ruled by 3 <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, 13 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and 47 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In many of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, where the distances are enormous, it is customary for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to take one or more <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a>, known as episcopal vicars, for the governing of parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. At the present time there are 44 of these episcopal vicars. The number of members of this Church must be about 70,000,000, or half the population of the Empire. There are at least 25,000,000 more believers who separated from the official church in the seventeenth century and make up the great Raskol <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (see <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">RUSSIA</a>). The remainder of the population of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> is made up of about 12,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> together with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>.
<h4 id="ii">The Servian Church of Servia</h4>

<p>It was not till November, 1879, that this Church secured its independence of the &OElig;cumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Since then it has been governed by a Holy Synod comprising the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a> and the four suffragan Bishops of Nich, Uchitz&eacute;, Timok and Chabatz. Its members number about 2,500,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is the Slavonic. &#151; The Servian Church of Montenegro. &#151; It is ruled by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Cettinj&eacute;, who goes to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Until 1852 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <em>Vladika</em>, was temporal as well as spiritual head of the principality. Since then the authority has been divided. The membership is about 250,000. &#151; The Servian Patriarchate of Carlovitz in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. &#151; This Church was founded in 1691 by Servian emigrants from <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>. It became a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> in 1848. Besides the patriarchal diocese, there are six others: Bracs, Buda, Carlstadt, Pakray, Temescaz, and Versecz. Its membership numbers about 1,080,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. It is governed by a Holy Synod and a national Parliament, or Assembly, of which one-third of the members are <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and the remainder <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. It meets every three years. &#151; The Servian Church of Bosnia-Herzegovina. &#151; Theoretically this Church still belongs to the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople, but since the annexation of these provinces by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> (6 October, 1908) it may be looked on as autonomous. It has four <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>. Seraiero, Mostar, Doinja-Touzla, and Banialouka, and numbers 700,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. &#151; Two other Servian groups have not yet acquired autonomy. That in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> belongs to the Rumanian <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Tchernovitz; it has two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> and Cattaro, and numbers 110,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The other group, in Turkey, in the vilayet of Uskub, acknowledges the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. It has two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, Prizrend and Uskub, and numbers 250,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
<h4 id="iii">The Bulgarian Exarchate</h4>

<p>After having concurrently two <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>, one at Tirnovo, suppressed in 1393, and another at Ochrida, suppressed in 1767, the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> have organized an independent Church, recognized by the Sublime Porte, 11 March, 1870. The <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, head of all <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in Turkey and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> who may be disposed to admit his authority, resides in Constantinople. He has subject to him in Turkey 21 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, of which about two-thirds are still waiting for the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> 11 <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The faithful of the exarchate number about 4,000,000, of whom 2,900,000 are in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and 1,000,000 in Turkey in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The proclamation of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> as an independent kingdom will bring about modifications in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domain, for it is hardly likely that <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a> will accept an outsider as spiritual head of its Ottoman subjects.
<h3 id="E">Orthodox Rumanians</h3>

<h4 id="i">The Church of Rumania</h4>

<p>This church has existed since 1864, though it was not recognized by the Phanar as independent until 13 May, 1885. It obeys a Holy Synod composed of two <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; its whole episcopate. Its membership numbers 4,800,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
<h4 id="ii">The Rumanian Church of Sibiu</h4>

<p>This Church, formerly under the Servian Patriarchate of Carlovitz, secured its independence in 1864. It is governed by a national Assembly composed of 90 members (30 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and 60 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>) who meet every three years. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Sibiu has two suffragans, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/01677a.htm">Arad</a> and of Karambes. Its computed membership is 1,750,000. (c) Servo-Rumanian Church of Tchernovitz. &#151; This Church secured independence in 1873. It comprises three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; Tchernovitz, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, situated in Bukovina, <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> and Cattaro in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> (its two suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>). The population of this Church, which in Bukovina is mainly Servo-Rumanian and in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> Servian, is about 520,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>To sum up, there are seventeen Orthodox Churches of various tongues and nationalities, knit together more or less by a common Byzantine Rite and a vague basis of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that becomes more and more imbued with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Their total membership does not exceed 100,000,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; the exact figure is 94,050,000, of whom about three quarters (70,000,000) are in the Russian dominions.
<h2 id="section3">Greek Catholic Churches</h2>

<p>Nearly every one of the Orthodox Churches of the Byzantine Rite has a corresponding Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As we saw in the majority of the Orthodox Churches, so in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Churches</a>, they are Greek only in name. Altogether eight divisions are recognized: <ul><li>(1) Pure Greeks, <li>(2) Italo-Greeks, <li>(3) Georgians, <li>(4) Gr&aelig;eco-Arabs (or <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>), <li>(5) <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, <li>(6) <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, <li>(7) <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and <li>(8) Rumanians.</ul>

<p>The total membership of these various Churches does not exceed 6,000,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; the exact figure is computed at 5,564,809, of whom 4,097,073 belong to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, 8488 to the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, 1,271,333 to the Rumanians, 138,735 to the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, and 49,180 to the Italo-Greeks and Pure Greeks. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Georgians is unknown, but it is small. These are the figures furnished by the 1907 edition of "Missiones Catholic&aelig;", published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (p. 743).
<h3 id="A">Pure Greeks</h3>

<p>Their Church has not yet been organized, it is under the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> at Constantinople. Parishes and missions exist at Constantinople, Cadi-Keui, Peramos, <a href="../cathen/03183c.htm">Gallipoli</a>, Malgara and C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia. The faithful number about 1000, under the care of a dozen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom seven are <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>. There are also <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this rite in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>. They are subject to the Delegation at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>.
<h3 id="B">The Italo-Greek Church</h3>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are of Greek or Albanian origin, and use the Byzantine Rite. They live mainly in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Calabria, and have some fixed colonies in <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and Carghese in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. Their number is not more than 50,000. Ecclesiastics in Calabria and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by two Italo-Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is Greek, but for the most part the vernacular of the faithful is Italian.
<h3 id="C">Georgian Churches</h3>

<p>Russia, unwilling to tolerate within her dominions an Orthodox Georgian Church distinct from the Russian, is all the more opposed to the creation of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Georgian Church. Out of from 30,000 to 35,000 Georgian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, about 8000 follow the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite, the remainder having adopted the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Georgian organization in existence is at Constantinople.
<h3 id="D">Gr&aelig;co-Arabs (or Melchites)</h3>

<p>All these are under a patriarch who bears the titles of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and who, moreover, has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all the faithful of his rite in the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>. Their number amounts to about 140,000 and they are subject to twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is either Arabic or Greek.
<h3 id="E">Ruthenians</h3>

<p>The Uniat Church of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has disappeared. Its last two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a> and <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, were suppressed in 1869 and in 1875 respectively. Since the disorders of 1905 many have availed themselves of the liberty of returning to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but as a precautionary measure they have adopted the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>.
<h3 id="F">Servians</h3>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> the ancient <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church has survived with a little more than 4,000,000 members. It has six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, of which three are in Galicia (the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Przemysl and of <a href="../cathen/14247a.htm">Stanislawow</a>) and three in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634a.htm">Munk&aacute;cs</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05484c.htm">Eperies</a> under the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Grau, and the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/04490a.htm">Crisium</a>, or Kreutz, in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">archiepiscopal province</a> of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a>, and of which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is mainly Servian).
<h3 id="G">Bulgarians</h3>

<p>The movement for union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, very strong in 1860, was, owing to political reasons, not a success. Today there are hardly 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> between the two Apostolic vicariates of Thrace and <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Thrace is under the care of the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>.
<h3 id="H">Rumanians</h3>

<p>The Rumanian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> uses the Byzantine Rite, but the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is Rumanian. It is established only in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and counts four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, viz., the <a href="../cathen/06123a.htm">Archdiocese of Fogaras</a> with the suffragan Dioceses of Armenopolis, Gross-Wardein, and Lugos, having in all 1,300,000 members.

<p>The Uniat-Rumanians of the Kingdom of Rumania have no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. In this summary I have omitted the other <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, the Coptic, the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a>, the Syriac, the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, the Chaldean and Malabrian Churches, because they do not use the Byzantine rite, and have no claim to be considered as Greek Churches, even in the wider meaning of the word.
<h2 id="section4">Greek-Church history</h2>
<h3 id="A">The first five centuries</h3>

<p>The Gospel, preached by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and by their disciples, who were converts from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, spread first of all among the Jewish communities of the Roman Empire. These Jewish settlements were mainly in the towns, and as a rule spoke the Greek tongue; and thus it came to pass that the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities were in the towns and used the Greek tongue in their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services. Gradually, however, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> converts from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> began to increase and, as the author of the so-called <a href="../fathers/1011.htm">Second Epistle of Clement</a> says, "The children of the barren <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> outnumbered those of the fruitful one". The original differences between the Jud&aelig;o-Christian and Helleno-Christian communities quickly disappeared, and soon there existed only <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, with a certain number of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which either held aloof of their own accord or were constrained to do so. At the end of the fourth century, at least in the East, nearly all the cities were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but the villages and country places, as in the West, offered a more stubborn resistance to the new religion. The government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was monarchical; as a rule every city had its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were his assistants; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and lower <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> attended to the ceremonial and to charitable works. Even before the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) ecclesiastical provinces had begun to appear, each having a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and several suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The size of these provinces generally corresponded to the extent of the civil provinces.

<p>The fourth canon of Nic&aelig;a expressly refers to such provinces. But were there also Churches whose high <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was recognized by a number of ecclesiastical provinces, and did they correspond with the future <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> and exarchates? We must reach the third century before we find conclusive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this. At that time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was looked up to as the Primate or <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In a somewhat similar way, though in a lesser degree, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> had authority in the provinces of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. For instance, at the end of the second century Serapion of Antioch exercised his authority at Rhossos, a town of Cilicia, and this same Serapion appears to have <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> Palout, the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. During the latter half of the third century we see assembled at Antioch the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and eastern <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, soon to become the civil diocese of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. As early as 251. we know of a synod that was to be held at Antioch because Fabius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that town, seemed to be leaning towards <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianism</a>. The promoters of this meeting were the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, C&aelig;sarea in Palestine, and C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia. A few years later, in 256, <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, treating of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> that had been disturbed by this quarrel, mentions Antioch, C&aelig;sarea in Palestine, &AElig;lia (Jerusalem), <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, Laodicea in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia. Somewhat later, again, from 264 to 268, the affair of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> was the occasion of many meetings of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and in the interests of that Church. They always came from the same provinces, viz., those extending from Polemoniac <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> (Neo-c&aelig;sarea) and Lycaonia (Iconium) to Arabia (Bostra) and Palestine (C&aelig;sarea and &AElig;lia). "Immediately after the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Galerius and <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximianus</a> a celebrated council was held at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, at which some fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the same countries, were again present; this time, however, the Provinces of Galatia, Bithynia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia are represented, but <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, properly so called, still remained outside the group" (Duchesne, "Christian Worship", London, 1904, p. 20). On the other hand, in Proconsular <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> no Church had yet succeeded in asserting authority over the others; Ephesus, the most famous of them, had merely a primacy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> over its rivals in influence and wealth, <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>, Sardis, and others.

<p>To sum up, then, during the opening years of the fourth century we find three principal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> groups in the Eastern Empire: <ul><li>(1) that of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, with authority over the whole of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; <li>(2) that of Antioch, with a more or less recognized <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the whole Greek world, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> proper, and even over lands beyond the frontiers of the Roman Empire, e.g., <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; <li>(3) Proconsular <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, forming a group apart.</ul>

<p>The Councils of Nic&aelig;a (325), Constantinople (381), Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon (451) legalized the existing state of things, created new Churches and established the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> as it has remained ever since. But in order to understand the situation properly, we must first briefly review the civil organization of the Roman Empire, which had such an influence over early Church organization.

<p>From <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> to the accession of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> (379) the Empire of the East included the civil <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (after its separation from Antioch), <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and the two Mysias, or Thrace. The remaining <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> formed part of the Empire of the West. On 19 January, 379, Gratian, Emperor of the West, ceded to his colleague, <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>, the Prefecture of Eastern Illyricum, which included the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Dacia and <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. Soon afterwards, between 424 and 487, Western Illyricum, or the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Pannonia, became part of the Empire of the East.

<p>Among the canons of Nic&aelig;a (325) that do not specifically deal with the ordinary ecclesiastical provinces, canons 6 and 7 confirm the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> accorded by immemorial custom to certain great Churches, such as Alexandria, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the other eparchies. It is not easy at first sight to determine what <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> the council referred to. Nevertheless it is a general opinion that the sixth canon aimed at securing to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> an exceptional rank, and at endowing him with powers over the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the four civil provinces of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, Libya, and Pentapolis, as ample as those exercised by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> over the various provinces of the Patriarchate of the West. Thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> all the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and from this some historians and canonists would have us conclude that he was, as a matter of fact, the only <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and that his entire <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was a single diocese. This is an evident exaggeration. At the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> there were four <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, one for each of the civil and ecclesiastical provinces; later their number rose to nine, or even ten, according as the emperors increased the number of civil provinces. The number of suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> rose at one time to a hundred. The organization of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Church really followed the same lines as the others. But the Patriarch, or Bishop, of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> had the right of consecrating all his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, once their election had been confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, whereas in the other greater Churches the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> himself discharged this function.

<p>Although the sixth canon, in as far as it refers to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, is far from clear, it would seem that the Nicene Council recognized and granted to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> the same <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the provinces of the civil diocese of the East (<em>Di&oelig;cesis Orientis</em>) that it had recognized and granted to the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> over the Provinces of the West and of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> respectively. Therefore it attributes to Antioch a supremacy over many provinces, each having its own <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, in such a way as to constitute them into a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. It is thought that the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Patriarchate of Antioch was coextensive with the aforesaid civil diocese of the East, but it may very likely have extended also over certain provinces in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>.

<p>The same canon requires that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the other eparchies be maintained. The meaning of the word eparchies is not clear and has been variously interpreted. According to some, it refers to ordinary ecclesiastical provinces, but this is hardly probable, seeing that the council had already dealt with them in its fourth canon. Others are of opinion that the council intended to grant the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>, Ephesus, and C&aelig;sarea the same privileges and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the provinces of the civil <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Thrace, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> that the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch enjoyed over the provinces of the civil <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the East. The second canon of the Council of Constantinople (381) seems to support this interpretation, where it says: "The Bishops of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> must watch over the concerns of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> only; those of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, over what concerns <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and those of Thrace over what concerns Thrace." Perhaps the council simply meant to enfranchise the provinces of these three civil <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, or any other Church, without, however, raising any particular see &#151; Ephesus for instance, or C&aelig;sarea &#151; to a particular rank like that of Antioch or Alexandria.

<p>As for <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, or &AElig;lia, according to the seventh canon, it remained a simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of C&aelig;sarea Maritima, its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, but enjoyed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to certain honours on the occasion of &oelig;cumenical councils, when its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sat next to those of the greater Churches of the empire.

<p>The Council of Constantinople (381) confirmed and defined, in its second canon, what the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> had attempted to outline. It was understood that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> should be the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the East. As for the remaining two <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, the ambiguous phrases of the second canon, and the interpretation thereof given by the historian <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.8</a>), do not permit us to infer the supremacy of any one Church over all the other Churches of a civil diocese. That Ephesus in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and C&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> held privileged positions is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, but that either Ephesus or <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> was at the head of the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> or of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, as Antioch was at the head of the Eastern episcopate, is a position which we have no documentary evidence to support. The third canon of this council of Constantinople brings another Church on the scene, that of the imperial capital itself, to which Nic&aelig;a had made no reference. The silence of the First &OElig;cumenical Council is easily understood when we remember that in 325 Byzantium, or Constantinople, was still an undistinguished <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, with Heraclea, in Thrace, as its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and that its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Metrophanes, had died as recently as 314. In consequence of the transfer of the seat of imperial government to Byzantium, the city increased in importance, even from an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> point of view; in 339 and 360 we find two <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Eusebius and Eudoxius, leaving their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Sees of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and Antioch to occupy this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, which they had already begun to consider the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of the Empire. The Council of 381 encouraged this attitude, and its third canon asserts that "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople ought to have a pre-eminence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> next to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, for that city is the new <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>".

<p>It would be hard to protest too strongly against the spirit of this canon, which attempts to measure the <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a> of a see by the civil importance of the city. But although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> refused to recognize it, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East accepted it, and Constantinople considered itself henceforward as the premier see of the Empire of the East.

<p>Novella cxxxi of Justinian approved this decision of the council: "Ita sancimus . . . . veteris Rom&aelig; papam primum esse omnium sacerdotum . . . . archiepiscopum Constantinopolis, nov&aelig; Rom&aelig;, post sanctissimam apostolicam sedem veteris Rom&aelig; secundum locum habere." Did this honorary pre-eminence carry with it a wider <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>? and can the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople be henceforward looked on as a patriarch? We have no juridical text in support of such a thing, but <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.8</a>) assures us that Constantinople did exercise authority over Thrace, while Theodoret of <a href="../cathen/04597a.htm">Cyrrhus</a> (<a href="../fathers/27025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.28</a>) attributes to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (398-404) a superior's authority over twenty-eight provinces. Now the <a href="../cathen/11124a.htm">"Notitia dignitatum"</a>, a document <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from about 410, reckons six provinces in Thrace, eleven in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and eleven in that of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. Constantinople was actually at the head of these three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, whose twenty-eight provinces officially made up its <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> in 451. In any case, if a superior <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over these twenty-eight provinces did not belong <em>de jure</em> to the Bishops of Constantinople from 381 to 457, it is quite certain that <em>de facto</em> they exercised such <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. (For a number of instances in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this see the article "Constantinople" in Vacant and Mangenot, "Dictionnaire de th&eacute;ologie catholique", II, 1323-25.) Furthermore, their aim at this time was to have only one <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, only one <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, of which they should be the chiefs, and this was to be brought about by the annexation of the provinces of Illyricum, subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Antioch and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Thus, on 14 July, 421, the Emperor Theodosius II issued a law whereby Illyricum was brought under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Byzantium (Cod. Just., I, ii, vi; Cod. Theod., XVI, ii, xlvi), but in consequence of the protests of <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface I</a> and of Honorius, Emperor of the West, this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> never was enforced.

<p>Again, according to <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26017.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.28</a>), Bishop Atticus of Constantinople obtained from Theodosius II a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> forbidding the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a single <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the East without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, but, owing to the opposition it encountered, this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was hardly ever observed, except in the civil <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Thrace, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. The struggle undertaken against the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a> brought nothing but disaster for Constantinople. In less than fifty years three of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> in 403, Nestorius in 431, <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a> in 449, were deposed by the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Theophilus, St. Cyril, and <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>. On the other band, in the Patriarchate of Antioch the Byzantine interference became more and more successful, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the case of Ibas, in the partition of Ph&oelig;nicia, and at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the Patriarch Maximus. In 431, at the Council of Ephesus, a fourth Greek Church, that of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, took its place side by side with Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and Antioch. Its subjection to Antioch never having been clearly defined, it had profited by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> disputes and the famous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Antioch (330-415) to proclaim its own autonomy. Once the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> ended, the Patriarchs of Antioch tried to reassert their authority; <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> resisted and even took advantage of the absence of the Syrian patriarch to have its independence recognized by the &oelig;cumenical council. Later, this independence was reaffirmed by the Emperor Zeno and by a council held at Constantinople in 488. The head of the <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cypriot</a> Church has never had the title patriarch, but only that of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>. The acknowledgment of an independent <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cypriot</a> Church was a serious loss for the Patriarchate of Antioch; following on this blow came two others in quick succession, the one beyond the frontiers of the Roman Empire, the other within those boundaries, which greatly diminished the influence of Antioch and the extent of its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Beyond the frontier, in the Persian kingdom of the Sassanides, were many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Syrian speech, governed by a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The Gospel had come to them from many points, principally from <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and other Churches subject to Antioch. There was, therefore, a certain bond of affection and gratitude between these Syrian Churches of the Persian Empire and those of the Roman Empire. In order to impose his authority on all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Papa bar Agga&iuml;, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> Ctesiphon, the capital of the kingdom, had recourse to the Syrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Roman Empire during the early years of the fourth century. They hastened to aid him, and by methods whose nature is unknown to us succeeded in placing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> Ctesiphon at the head of the Persian Church, and in bringing that Church under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Antioch. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the other important sees in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> accepted very unwillingly the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, and there were continuous revolts against it. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> always fell back on the support of the western Syrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, especially in 410, when Marutas of Maiphergat in this way overcame all opposition. The Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> had had recourse to Antioch only as an expedient for imposing their supremacy upon their Persian brethren; that end once attained, they, in their turn, shook off the tutelage of Antioch. The Council of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, held in 424 laid down that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> "could bring no complaint against their patriarch before the patriarch of the Westerns (Antioch), and that every cause which could not be settled by their own patriarch was to be reserved for the tribunal of Christ". That ended the matter. By this council the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> cut itself off definitively from the Greek Churches. The pity is that a few years later, by adopting <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> as its national <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, it also cut itself off from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world.

<p>In 451, at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, another Church was set up to the detriment of Antiochene prestige, viz., that of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Holy City had obtained from the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) the purely honorary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which his successors had endeavoured to turn into tangible realities. <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, and especially Juvenal, tried to shake off the yoke of C&aelig;sarea Maritima, the religious capital of Palestine, and, after C&aelig;sarea, the yoke of Antioch, the patriarchal see of the East. Juvenal, elected in 424, acted, indeed, as if he were already independent. Afterwards he sought official <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> for the usurpations he had been guilty of. He applied first to the Council of Ephesus (431) and put forward forged documents, which <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> refused to admit. Next he turned to the "Robber Council" of Ephesus (449), and his demands were conceded. At the same time he extorted a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> from Theodosius II granting his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the three provinces of Palestine, also over Arabia, and a part of Ph&oelig;nicia. Two years later, at <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, through fear of losing more, Maximus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, came to an understanding with Juvenal whereby the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was to remain in possession of the three provinces of Palestine. In consequence of this agreement, which was ratified by the council, Juvenal became patriarch of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>The same <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, by its twenty-eighth Canon, drawn up in the absence of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, regularized the situation at Constantinople; it <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> anew the third canon of the Second &OElig;cumenical Council, which had made Byzantium the first see of the East and the second of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, giving it effective <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the twenty-eight provinces of the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Thrace, <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> it was to have the right of consecrating, and further authorizing it to ordain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for barbarian lands, which was the germ of its subsequent policy towards the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> nations. Moreover, the council reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the capital the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to decide on all appeals brought to his tribunal by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the three Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> and of the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>.

<p>Beginning from the year 451, then, we find four Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> (Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) and one autocephalous Church (Cyprus) under the rule of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Beyond and within the limits of the Roman Empire two other Churches had secured autonomy and broken with the Greek Churches; these were the Persian and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Churches, offshoots from the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>. Lastly, in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the majority of the Greek-speaking Churches looked to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as their patriarch.
<h3 id="B">Decay of the Greek Churches of the East and rise of the Byzantine hegemony (451-847)</h3>

<p>The definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) had curiously agitated the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. The condemnation of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, and their adherents amounted in the eyes of many to a condemnation of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> and of the Council of Ephesus, if not to a victory for Nestorius. It happened that these religious disturbances reached their climax in the remotest provinces of the empire, in those which, while willingly or unwillingly subject to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, had still retained a lively memory of their former national independence and glory, together with their own language, liturgy, art and literature. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> became for the most part <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>; Palestine also. Even the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Ephesus, who resumed, about 474, the title of Patriarch, was bitterly opposed to the new definition; in the end, however, order and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> prevailed in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Until the reign of Justinian (527-65) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> for or against the two natures in Christ was officially triumphant according as the emperor happened to be <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> or Dyophysite, and lent to the accepted <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the support of his sword. Justinian, the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, finally caused Dyophysitism to triumph, but the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> he had to use lost him the support of all the Eastern and African portions of the empire. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> and that of Antioch nominated <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and thus began the Coptic and Jacobite Churches which exist even yet. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> nine out of every ten of the faithful declared against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the imperial Court; in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> the proportion was not so great. It may be said that about one-half of the subjects of Justinian accepted the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Chalcedon. Efforts to impose a heterodox patriarch on Palestine were in vain; except in the region of Garza, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were powerful enough to successfully resist the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. To sum up, then, we find that, as early as the sixth century, of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> in the East, one (Alexandria) had lost nearly all its subjects, another (Antioch) retained but one-half, while the third (Jerusalem) was too inconsiderable ever to dispute the primacy with Constantinople. The latter thus became the only real Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, to which the other three, surnamed <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> (Imperialists), looked for favours and protection against <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> competition and later against the threatening domination of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>.

<p>This leads us to a consideration of the second cause that completely ruined the hopes of the three Greek Churches of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. It came from Arabia and spread like an oil-stain over Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It even made great efforts to cross the Taurus range and enter the Greek world, but in this was everywhere defeated. For the moment its conquests were limited to provinces where the country folk had remained for the most part aloof from Hellenic speech and civilization. Thus the Syrian <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> gladly welcomed the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquerors as their brethren in race and in speech, and, it would seem, often aided them in their conquests. Their complaisance towards the new r&eacute;gime brought them many favours not shown to the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, who, because of their origin, or at least because of their relations with foreign Byzantium, were everywhere watched, hunted down, and proscribed. Without the help of Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, from whom they begged help and assistance, it is very probable that these <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Churches would have disappeared. At the very time when the great <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion and the spread of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> was taking place, Byzantium was emerging from a disastrous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> which had almost brought about the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> power, and its emperor was occupied in rallying the various <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Churches to the official Church by means of the <em>ad captandum</em> formula of one will and one energy in Christ. The attempt failed owing to the splendid resistance set afoot by St. Sophronius of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/10078b.htm">St. Maximus of Constantinople</a>; its net result was a fresh loss for the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Patriarchate of Antioch, from which the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Maro on the Orontes seceded, to found, with the aid of the villagers of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and the Lebanon, the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church, <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but which at a later date accepted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.

<p>The growing weakness of the three eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> and of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, whose titular had for a while to take refuge in <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, soon forced them to seek the moral and material support of Constantinople. It was eagerly granted, and Constantinople, thus freed from a rival in the East, turned its attention towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the West. As we have seen, the civil diocese of Thrace was the only one in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople; the provinces of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, Thessalia, Epirus (old and new), which formed the civil <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, Dacia, and Pannonia, were included in the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Over these remote provinces the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> exercised his spiritual supremacy through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> about 380, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Justiniana Prima (Uskub), appointed in 535. Until the eighth century this arrangement worked without much opposition on the part of Constantinople, and the ecclesiastical provinces of Illyricum were considered as forming part of the Roman Patriarchate. The Emperor Leo III, the Isaurian, seems to have been the first to interfere with the custom, when, in 733, after his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he increased the tribute from Calabria and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, confiscated the patrimony of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in those regions, and aimed a blow at the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by depriving him of the obedience of Illyricum and Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which were thenceforth attached to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Such, at least, is the usual interpretation of an obscure text in the Chronicle of <a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">Theophanes</a> (Hubert in "Revue Historique" (1899), I, 21-22); it is confirmed by an observation of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> ecclesiastic Basil, who, in the ninth century, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> cities of Illyricum and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, asserts that they had been made subject to the authority of Constantinople "because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had fallen into the hands of the Barbarians" (Georgii Cyprii Descriptio Orbis Romani, ed. Gelzer, p. 27). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> protested against this high-handed <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, but no attention was paid to their protests, and since about 733 Illyricum has been attached to the Byzantine Patriarchate. In this way it gained about one hundred <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, nor was this all: starting with the principle that no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> could be in any way dependent on an outside patriarch, the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperors took away from the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, on the plea that he was a subject of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> caliphs, the twenty-four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of Byzantine Isauria, and from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope of Rome</a> the fifteen Greek <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople became co-extensive with the limits of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>.

<p>Besides this increase of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the establishment of a permanent synod (<em>synodos endemousa</em>) and the addition to his title of the adjective <em>&OElig;cumenical</em> rapidly placed the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Byzantium in the front rank. The permanent synod dates most probably from the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Nestorius (381-97). It was a sort of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal permanently in session at Constantinople, made up, as a rule, of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom business or <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> had called to the capital; the patriarch himself presided over the tribunal. It attended to the solution of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs submitted to the judgment of the emperor, so that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, as its president, became <em>ex officio</em> arbiter between the Court and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire; it was a privileged position due to the very force of circumstances, and in the last resort it subjected all the great <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, of the East, to the judicial authority of the Byzantine Bishop. The ninth and seventeenth canons of Chalcedon confirmed and consolidated this state of things, and the insertion of those canons in the Civil Code gave them thenceforward equal authority with any other imperial decrees. The title <em>&OElig;cumenical</em> was granted for the first time at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a> (449) to the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a>, and at the time it looked like a dangerous innovation, and was repudiated at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. Soon afterwards we find it applied to Popes <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a>, Hormisdas, and Agapitus, and to the Patriarchs of Constantinople, John II (518-520), Epiphanius (520-535), Anthimus (536), Menas (536-552). It was in 588, on the occasion of a council, that the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/08493a.htm">John IV</a>, surnamed the Faster, seems to have restricted the use of the honorary title to his own see. This gave rise to a fresh quarrel with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which saw therein a new evidence of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pope Pelagius II</a> annulled the acts of this council and his successor, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604), began a lengthy correspondence on the matter with the Byzantine Patriarchs <a href="../cathen/08493a.htm">John IV</a> and Cyriacus, but nothing ever came of it. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> went on protesting, but the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, supported by the Court, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, also by the other Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, refused to forego the title, which they have borne ever since, and which has given them a colour of honorary supremacy over all the Churches of the East.
<h3 id="A">Internal organization of the Byzantine Churches</h3>

<p>The superior <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of a Greek Church at the period we are treating of, viz., from the fourth to the tenth century, was composed of a patriarch, a <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, the greater <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, the autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The patriarch is at this period the highest <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, at the head of a whole Church, and, as we have seen, there were only four such: Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a> exercised <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over a portion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on an equality with the patriarch, save for the fact that he must originally have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the patriarch. Such, we are told, was the position of the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and of the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, with reference to the See of Antioch, and towards the same see, but at a later period, of the Catholicoi of Romagyris, of Irenoupolis, and of <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>, except perhaps Alexandria, never had such an ecclesiastical dignitary.

<p>The greater <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> ruled each an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> and had under their authority a certain number of suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Their position was similar to that of the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. The number of these <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> varied in the various <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> according to the actual number of ecclesiastical provinces. For a long period <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had three, in the sixth century Antioch had twelve, in the fifth century Alexandria had ten, in that same century Constantinople had twenty-eight, which rose to thirty-two about 650, and to forty-nine about the beginning of the tenth century. The "autocephalous" <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> had no suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and depended directly on the patriarch. Latin canon law knows no such dignitary. These <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> had each his own diocese; they were not <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a></em>. The number of these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, small at first, increased in the East to such a degree that at the present time one rarely meets with any of another rank. In the sixth century there was only one, that of Chalcedon, in the Patriarchate of Constantinople; in the tenth century only two, those of Chalcedon and <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>. We have no documentary evidence as to how things stood in this respect in the Patriarchates of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> do not differ from autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, except as being inferior to them in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. They depend directly on the patriarch, and have the real government of a diocese. This title, which corresponds to the exempt archbishoprics, was formerly very common in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. About 650 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople reckoned thirty-four <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> of this sort; in the tenth century, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, on the evidence of three documents, it had fifty-one; at the end of the eleventh century the number stood at thirty-nine, and since then it has gone on decreasing in the East, so that at present the Greek Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> alone possesses this institution.

<p>The position of suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is too well known to require any explanation. In the sixth century there were fifty-six of them in the three provinces of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, one hundred and twenty-five in the twelve provinces of Antioch. About 650 there were three hundred and fifty-two in the thirty-two provinces of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and in the early part of the tenth century, when the number of its provinces rose to forty-nine, Constantinople had five hundred and twenty-two suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. As in the West, the number of suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> in a province was not always the same in the same <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Thus, in 650 the provinces of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and of Lycia had each thirty-six such sees, but the province of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, or Rhodope, had only two. In the sixth century, again, in the Patriarchate of Antioch, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Dara had three suffragans, while the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> in Isauria had twenty-four. To gain a collective <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of this <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> it should be remembered that in 650 the Patriarchate of Constantinople counted thirty-two metropoles, or capitals of ecclesiastical provinces, one autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, thirty-four autocephalous archbishoprics, and three hundred and fifty-two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> &#151; a grand total of four hundred and nineteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. A century earlier the Patriarchate of Antioch could boast of twelve <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, five autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, two exempt <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> (a peculiar institution of this Church), and one hundred and twenty-five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> &#151; a grand total of one hundred and forty-four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. For want of accurate information it is impossible to give similar details for the Patriarchates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>.

<p>Below the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came the other ecclesiastical dignitaries &#151; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, cantors, and others. Ecclesiastical functionaries were very numerous. After the patriarch in the capital, and in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> after the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the chief dignitary was the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, a sort of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> having direct control over the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, if not over the faithful of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The title soon disappeared and was replaced by that of protosyncellus, which has remained to our own times. There were, moreover, referendaries who carried important messages and looked after the business of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> name; <em>apocrisiarii</em> (in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> <em>responsales</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>), or representatives of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> at the emperor's Court, of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> to their patriarch, and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>; <em>&oelig;conomoi</em>, or bursars, who looked after <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and who entrusted the administration of such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in outlying districts to delegates of various names and titles: a <em>kimeliarchos</em>, in charge of the church treasury and also known as the skeuophylax; a <em>chartophylax</em> or archivist; a chancellor, or master of ceremonies, etc.

<p>During this period the Greek episcopate was, as a general rule, recruited by election. The notables united with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> drew up a list of three candidates which they submitted to the choice of the patriarch, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, according as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to be filled was a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> or a simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. In practice, the patriarch and, most of all, the emperor interfered in these elections. The <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a patriarch belonged in the first instance to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople, then to a committee of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; in reality the choice was always settled by the emperor. From the list of three candidates presented by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> he selected one as patriarch, and if none of the names presented was agreeable to him he put a new name before the electoral college, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could only confirm.

<p>The status of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was much the same as now. In the cities and populous centres there were many learned and often exemplary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who, for the most part, had been through the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; but in the rural districts they were generally <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> repute. Because of their exemptions and their civil privileges, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were numerous. Churches and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> abounded everywhere, especially in the cities; every <em>Basileus</em> (emperor), even the least religious-minded, was lavish with money for their construction. An <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the personnel employed at this time in serving a church may be gathered from two churches in Constantinople. A law of Justinian (535) fixed the number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> at St. Sophia and its three adjacent churches at 425 &#151; viz., 60 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 100 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, 40 <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, 90 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, 110 Lecters, 25 cantors, to which we must add 100 doorkeepers. From Justinian's reign to that of Heraclius this number increased, and in 627 the latter emperor was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to put a limit to the number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> serving this church. Unless subsequent endowments authorized otherwise, the regular number was to be 525, viz., 80 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 150 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, 40 <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, 70 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, 160 <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, 25 cantors, besides 75 doorkeepers, 2 syncelli, 12 chancellors, and 40 notaries. The little church of Blachern&aelig; had a personnel at this period of 75 members, viz., 12 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 18 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, 20 <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, 4 cantors, and 7 doorkeepers. From these two examples we may infer what the other smaller or larger churches must have required.

<p>Benevolent institutions claimed a proportionate number of functionaries and titles; in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity few social bodies were as much concerned with the diminution of social ills as was that of Constantinople. There were special <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> to succour every form of physical and moral suffering; from the emperor to the humblest citizen all were interested in their maintenance. Hospices and shelters were found everywhere; there were also <em>xenodochia</em>, or hostelries for strangers; <em>gerontocomia</em>, or homes for the aged; <em>ptochotrophia</em>, or asylums for the poor; <em>nosocomia</em>, or <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for the sick; <em>orphanotrophia</em>, or <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling hospitals</a>; <em>brephotrophia</em>, or cr&ecirc;ches; and even <em>lobotrophia</em>, or homes for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. These institutions were mostly conducted by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, which fact brings us to a consideration of the monastic system.

<p>If we consider their rules, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> may be divided into two classes: solitaries and cenobites. The solitaries had various names, according to their habitations or the exercises which they practised. They were known as <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> or <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluses</a> if they provided their own necessities of life or accepted them from strangers; <em>stylites</em> or <em>dendrites</em>, if they chose a pillar or a tree as the scene of their <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>; <em>lauriotes</em> or <em>kelliotes</em>, if they lived together in a <em>laura</em>. These last belong rather to the Eastern world properly so called (Egypt, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia) than to the Greek, or Byzantine, world. On the other hand, the Greek Christian world was famous for its cenobites, who always and everywhere followed a community life. Solitary and cenobite had each a special dress, the names and uses of which are well known. The <em>laur&oelig;</em>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, had each its own superior, sometimes called <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a>, and sometimes hegumenos, terms synonymous in the beginning, but soon differentiated. Gradually <em>archimandrite</em> came to mean the head of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of a city or of a diocese. Below him came the <em>deutereuon</em> or prior, at least until the sixth century; after that the place was taken by the <em>&oelig;conomos</em>, or bursar. In the ninth century every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (presumably the cenobites of every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>) or district formed a sort of federation under the presidency of a hegumenos known as the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> or <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a>. In the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> this presidency over the <a href="../cathen/09039a.htm">laurites</a> and <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> devolved on the Hegumenos of St. Sabas, and that of the cenobites on the Hegumenos of St. Theodosius. In the archdiocese of Constantinople the superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> exercised this function. As soon as peace was definitively granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and especially after the reign of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a> (378-95), the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> had its period of greatest splendour. Emperors, empresses, consuls, patricians, senators, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> vied in building conventual homes for "those who had put on the robe of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>" and who had become "citizens of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". As early as 518, we find a petition to Pope Hormisdas signed by fifty-four superiors of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> for men in Constantinople; in 536 no fewer than sixty-eight superiors of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> from the same city assisted at the council which deposed the patriarch Anthimos, while the neighbouring Diocese of Chalcedon alone sent forty more. In Palestine the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had at least 100 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. And it must not be imagined that the number of their inmates was small. The laura of St. Sabas had 150 inmates; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Theodosius, 400; the New Laura more than 600. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that all of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were not so populous, but if we place the average number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> for each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at 50 we shall not, be far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Let it not be forgotten that 10,000 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Palestine assembled at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 516 to demand that the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> be observed. It is worth noting that there never existed a religious congregation, properly speaking, in the Greek world; this Western form of monasticism was unknown to the East. There every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was independent of its neighbour, and where many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> had the same founder their union rarely lasted beyond his lifetime. Again, in spite of a still prevalent Western <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, the Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> never had a religious rule, in the canonical sense of the word. Even the Rules of <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">St. Basil</a>, St. Anthony, and <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> were not canonical rules. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> obeyed a whole series of <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, or monastic regulations, either written or, more often, preserved by oral tradition, which were the same everywhere. But if they had no rule properly so called, they had an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a> of <em>typica</em> or regulations. In the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices the customs of St. Sabas at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, i.e. the Palestine customs, were combined with those of the <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studium</a> at Constantinople or some other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and thus all desired variations were obtained. For the monastic life itself the "Typica", i.e. original charters or constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, were the guide. The most ancient of these "Typica" known to us is that of St. Athanasius the Athonite (or of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>), which dates from 969. In matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> all Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or to the patriarch; the latter known as <em>stauropegiac</em>, because the patriarch asserted his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by placing a wooden cross (<em>stauros</em>) behind the altar. It was in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> almost exclusively that the more eminent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of all ranks were trained, and to it dethroned emperors and disgraced courtiers fled for refuge. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were the historians, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the poets of that time; the leaders of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and their opponents were <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; councils were convened or prevented as the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> thought good. They assisted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by their learning and disturbed the empire by their quarrels. In short, they held the whole foreground of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> stage, and absorbed all the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the Greek Church. And while their extensive possessions, exempt from taxes, drained the finances of the empire, the thousands upon thousands of young men who flocked to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> robbed the land of its agricultural class and the army of its recruits. As it existed in the Greek world, the monastic life caused perhaps more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than good, and it is undoubtedly to it we owe that narrow pietism, that formalism and ritualism in devotion, consisting altogether in the externals of religion, which is even now so characteristic of the East.
<h3 id="B">The emperor; relations between East and West; liturgy</h3>

<p>In the foregoing sketch of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> body the Byzantine emperor has not appeared. Yet no one has a greater right to a place in that body: Heir of the Roman emperors, the Basileus had inherited also the office of <em>pontifex maximus</em>, and, though after the fifth century that title no longer appears on public documents, yet every Greek looked up to the Basileus as the head of the national religion. Moreover, the emperor was the chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who had raised him above humanity in order to draw him nearer to Himself. As <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a> tells us, "His intelligence is a reflexion of the Divine intelligence, he is a partaker of the power of the Almighty." In his "Instruction" to the "most divine" Justinian, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Agapetus reproduces under another form these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> so prevalent at Byzantium: "It was a sign from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that pointed out the Basileus for the empire; he was predestined in the designs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to rule the world, even as the eye is set within the head to control the body. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has need of no one; the emperor needs only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Between the Deity and the emperor there is no intermediary" (P.G., LXXXVI, 1177). The Divine call to the empire gave the emperor a sacred character, and the anointing, the sign of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, became his by Divine right. To take the life of the Basileus or attack his authority was to resist the will of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and to commit a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>, unless the one who did so happened to be, like <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> of old, also the chosen one and the anointed of the Lord. This anointing and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> which it conferred gave the emperor a high place among the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the altar. He became the <em>Isapostolos</em>, the equal of the Apostles, or even the thirteenth Apostle. Hence he held a special position between lay <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> body. He dominated, and belonged to both, uniting in himself both elements of the social order, the civil and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. Moreover, this special <em>sacerdotium</em> reserved for the emperor secured him special <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and powers. "I also am a bishop", said Constantine to the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of his day. "You are the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assigned to look after the domestic affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; I am appointed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to oversee all that lies outside." And Leo III, the Isaurian, wrote to <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>: "Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and king?" &#151; Priest, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <em>Isapostolos</em>, Apostle himself, the Basileus was placed there to guard the purity of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; he gave legal sanction to the decisions of councils and inserted their canons in the public code. He convened <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, was present at their sessions, or sent his representative to them; he controlled their discussions, and only permitted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to leave when they had defined and legislated according to the Faith and the canons, or even according to his own wishes. If he frequently chose <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he was not remiss in deposing them as soon as they stood in his way. Orthodox and virtuous <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were the victims of wicked emperors, while immoral or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ones were cast out by <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> emperors. But it was always a matter of politics, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was merely a pawn in the despotic hands of the State. This condition has been happily described by an expressive barbarism as the rule of C&aelig;saropapism.

<p>The relations that grew up between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Greek Churches during the long period from the death of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> to the end of the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast persecutions</a> (337-843) were far from cordial. In principle East and West were united; in fact they were separated during most of that time. During those 506 years the Greek Church was in open <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during seven periods aggregating at least 248 years. The sum total is reckoned thus: <ul><li>(1) The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in connexion with St. Athanasius and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343) to the accession of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> to the See of Constantinople (398) &#151; 55 years; <li>(2) in connexion with the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> by the episcopate of the East (404-15) &#151; 11 years; <li>(3) in regard to the Byzantine patriarch Acacius and the Emperor Zeno's <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">"Henoticon" edict</a> (484-519) &#151; 35 years; <li>(4) arising out of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> movement of Sergius and Heraclius (640-81) &#151; 41 years; <li>(5) arising out of the first <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic conflict</a>, begun by Leo III, the Isaurian (726-87) &#151; 61 years; <li>(6) arising out of the adulterous marriage contracted by the Emperor Constantine VI (795-811) &#151; 16 years; <li>(7) in connexion with the second <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic persecution</a> (814-43) &#151; 29 years.</ul>

<p>This gives a total of 248 years of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> out of a period of 506 years, i.e. nearly one-half the time. Again, it must not be forgotten that divisions vexed certain individual Churches &#151; e.g., the Schism of Antioch (330-415), which had its effect not only on the Churches of the East but also on those of the West. It must also be confessed that when circumstances demanded strength of will and determination the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were very often culpable. Of all these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> they might at least have lessened the duration and importance, if not altogether avoided them, had they better understood and realized their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. In the patriarchal See of Constantinople, the premier see of the Greek Empire, we find nineteen <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, whom the first seven &OElig;cumenical Councils, all held in the East, condemned by name, or who vehemently opposed the decisions of such councils. These nineteen were: <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, Macedonius, Eudoxius, Demophilos, all four <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; Nestorius, Acacius, Timotheus, Anthimus, of whom the last three were <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>; Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul, Peter, John VI, all <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>; Anastasius, Constantine II, Nicetas, Theodotus Cassiteras, Anthony, John VII Lecanomantos, all <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>. And this list might be increased, if we were to include the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> who, though not formally <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, would not condemn their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> predecessors, and because of this weakness were unable to obtain communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. If in the two <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch the number of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> is less, it is because there an almost immediate rupture took place between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> or <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>. Hence we meet fewer <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in these patriarchal sees for the very good reason that in these places the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> quickly set up their own separate churches, whereas in Byzantium, the seat of the central power, both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> either could not or did not dare set up <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies distinct from the State Church, but were constrained to accept <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> or heterodox teaching according to the bias of the emperors. Often were the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> constrained to stifle the voice of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Probably no Church can furnish so many examples of the kind. In 449 more than two hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Synod of Ephesus</a> defined <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> as a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, while two years later, at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, six hundred and thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> approved the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the two natures. In 476 the Basileus made five hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sign a retractation of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, while in 458 Emperor Leo I obtained an equal number of signatures in favour of that same council. The same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> said Yea and Nay within a few years of each other with a facility that, to say the least, is disconcerting. In 681 at the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council the whole Greek episcopate pronounced itself in favour of the two wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, yet, in 712, the same episcopate, with the exception of a few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, solemnly approved the condemnation of the former council pronounced by the Emperor Philippicus, and retracted its disapproval one year afterwards. In 753, at the conciliabulum of Hi&eacute;ria, near <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, 388 Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> applauded the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> edicts of Constantine Copronymus, and in 787, at the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a>, they condemned his memory and restored the cultus of images.

<p>Degradation of will, and slavery of the whole episcopate to the whims of the emperors &#151; such are the main causes of these wretched tergiversations. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there were some noble, though rare, exceptions among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Be it understood, their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not in question. On this score <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, as a rule, were ahead of their brethren in the West. This is one of the things that startle the student of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature of the two Churches during this same period. In the East there is no such suspension of literary activity as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have lasted in the West from the period of the Germanic invasions to the magnificent efflorescence of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> had one incontestable superiority over its rival: it had one centre of gravity, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and always recognized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as the visible head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The ecclesiological <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, on the contrary, is very rudimentary; they do not appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and recognize its imprescriptible <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> only very rarely and in extreme cases. With the exception of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, St. Theodore the Studite, and a few other rare examples, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Greek Church never touch on the primacy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, except when they are imploring the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> help to bring a dangerous adversary to reason. The danger past &#151; the shock avoided &#151; they have forgotten everything.

<p>The primitive Church, Gr&aelig;co-Syriac in speech, as we have said, adopted the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, which consisted of readings from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on some subject furnished by the reading, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. To this was added the sacred banquet of the Supper instituted by Christ, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ritual forms borrowed for the most part from the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a> and from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. We first find somewhat precise indications of this liturgy in the "Teaching of the Apostles", the Epistle of Pope St. Clement, and the First Apology of St. Justin. "From these", says Duchesne (Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien, p. 53), "we must descend at once to the fourth century. It is about this period that we come upon documents, of a kind that may be made use of, bearing upon the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> usages which were afterwards completed and diversified until they became what we see them." This same author adds that from that period it is possible to classify all known <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> under "four principal types: the Syriac, the Alexandrian, the Roman, and the Gallican. . . . The Syriac had already given way to many sub-types, each having its distinct characteristics." We shall here deal only with the Syriac and Alexandrian types, the only ones used in the East.

<p>The Syriac type, properly so-called, followed in the Patriarchates of Antioch and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, is mainly represented by the Greek or Syriac Liturgy of St. James and other analogous <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. Up to the Arabic invasion Mass was said in Greek, except in the country churches, where Syriac was used. This latter speech was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> as their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language when they separated from the official Church. In our day these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Syrians are the only ones who retain the Syriac rite, with some modifications especially noteworthy in the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church.

<p>A sub-type of the Syriac rite is represented by the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> used in the Syriac Churches of Mesopotamia and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; the liturgy of Sts. Addeus and Maris, still in use among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Chaldeans, is another example. Another sub-type is represented by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Liturgy, also derived from that of Antioch, but modified since 491, when the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> separated from the Greek Churches and marked the separation by adding to the divergencies of their rites. Lastly, a third sub-type is represented by the Cappadoco-Byzantine liturgy which is in the main a copy of the Syriac. It was by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were natives of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> or Cappadocia &#151; <a href="../cathen/05614c.htm">Eusebius</a>, Eudoxius, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Nectarius, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">John Chrysostom</a>, and Nestorius &#151; that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople was governed at the time of its foundation and definite organization, and it is this Byzantine liturgy that has survived in all Greek Churches, whether Orthodox or <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a>, in the Patriarchates of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the Churches of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, and others, just as the Roman Liturgy has predominated in all the Latin Churches. It should be noted, however, that in the majority of these Churches Greek is not the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language, but Arabic, or Slavonic, or Rumanian, into which the text of the Greek Liturgy has been literally translated. For the Byzantine liturgy there exist, besides the Mass of the Presanctified, known to have existed since the year 615, two complete <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>: that of St. Basil, in almost universal use in the East about the year 520 (P.L., LXV, 449), and that of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, which is the one mainly followed at present.

<p>Of the Alexandrian Liturgy, omitting certain later or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> copies, we have three complete texts: the Greek Liturgy of St. Mark, which seems to have been drawn up by St. Cyril; the Coptic Liturgy, said to be by <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>. Each of these represents a different group of the same rite, and all are fundamentally alike.
<h3 id="C">The Greek Schism; conversion of the Slavs (Ninth to Eleventh Century)</h3>

<p>The Greek Schism, about which space permits us to say very little (see PHOTIUS; MICHAEL CALUBARIUS), was caused by something that must have seemed trivial at Constantinople. On 23 November, 858, the Patriarch Ignatius was deposed, and on 25 December in the same year Photius succeeded him. Ignatius was deposed because he had refused Communion to the Emperor Bardas, who was living openly in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with his daughter-in-law. It was not the first time at Byzantium that for more or less lawful actions an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> patriarch had been deposed and another appointed in his place. Thus, among other examples, Macedonius II had succeeded Euphemius in 496; John III had succeeded <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutychius</a> in 565; Cyrus had succeeded Callinicus in 706, and John VI had replaced Cyrus in 712, without causing any great commotion. Ignatius might then have let things take their course and waited in his retreat till fortune turned his way once more. This he did not do, and, if he was somewhat lacking in suppleness, his right was incontestable. Once he had refused to consent to his deposition, <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> was bound to uphold him and to condemn Photius, who was an outright usurper. Photius was clever enough to see that a rupture with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on this point would not satisfy even the Greeks, so he cast about for another issue. He took, one by one, the many causes for separation that had been in the air for centuries and united them into a body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; then, confident in his learning and prestige, he decided to give battle. The insertion of the "Filioque" clause in the Creed, the procession of the Holy Ghost <em>ab utroque</em>, etc., were so many reasons which were bound to have their effect upon the leading minds when the question of the separation came up. Then again the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes'</a> acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings as Emperors of the West was bound to carry weight in Byzantine political circles. Moreover, it was evident by this time that between the Latin and Greek worlds there existed a chasm which must grow broader with the years. However, the Photius affair was arranged. Ignatius forgave his rival and, it appears, on his death-bed designated him as his successor. <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> sanctioned this choice, and if subsequent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Photius it was for special reasons not yet sufficiently known.

<p>In 886, Photius was deposed by the Emperor Leo VI, who disliked him, and, between 893 and 901, a reconciliation of the two Churches was effected by <a href="../cathen/08425a.htm">Pope John IX</a> and the Patriarch Antonius Cauleas. During the entire tenth century, and the first part of the eleventh, relations between the Roman and the Greek Churches were excellent. There were, no doubt, occasional difficulties, always unavoidable in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> different in customs, speech, and civilization, but we may almost go so far as to say that the union between the Churches was as deep and sincere as it was during the first three centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a>, however, desired a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> for no other reason, apparently, than to satisfy his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and in 1054 he succeeded in making one at the very time when everything seemed to promise a lasting peace. For this purpose he brought forward, besides the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> reasons stated by Photius, many others that Photius had neglected or merely hinted at, and which were judged particularly fitted to catch the popular fancy. The use of <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">azymes</a>, or unleavened bread, in the liturgy, the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> imposed on all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the West, the warlike manners of Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the shaven face and the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, the Saturday fast, and other such divergencies of practice were used to discredit the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. Thoughtful men may not have been misled by these specious arguments, but the mass of the people and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were certainly influenced, and at Constantinople it was they who made up public opinion. For this very reason the policy of <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a>, petty and superficial as it was, was better fitted than that of Photius to bring about permanent results. Indeed, so thoroughly did it cut off the Greek peoples from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that since then she has never won them back.

<p>Unfortunately, this movement of separation under Photius and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> was on foot at the very time when the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> were being <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, a fact in the history of the evangelization of the nations second only in importance to the conversion of the Germanic races. The <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> and Croatians, settled by the Emperor Heraclius (610-41) on the lands they still inhabit, had adopted the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching of Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But the progress of the new religion was so slow that a second conversion was deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. It took place under the Emperor Basil the Macedonian (867-86); as it was entrusted to Byzantine missionaries the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> of Constantinople was adopted. This had no small weight in detaching from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> whole provinces that were formerly subject to it, and when these numerous Servian Churches broke away from Byzantium, it was to organize autonomous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies independent of both <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople. In this way a whole region was lost to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, who had crossed the Danube about the same time as the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, formed a more or less homogeneous nation with the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> and became a warrior people that more than once struck terror into the heart of the Byzantine Basileus. Towards the end of 864, or in the opening months of 865, their king, Boris, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by a Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and took the name of Michael after his godfather, the Emperor of Byzantium. Photius, who was patriarch at the time, did not see his way to granting all the demands of King Boris, so, like a cunning politician, the latter turned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and succeeded in obtaining successively several missionaries to organize the new-born Church within his territory. His next step was to send away all the German and Byzantine missionaries whom he found there. His real <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to have a patriarch of his own who would anoint him emperor just as the Greek patriarch anointed the Basileus at Constantinople, and as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> anointed the Germanic emperor of the West. Whether he got his patriarch from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or from Constantinople mattered little; the main thing was to have one at any cost. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not fall in with his plan, and Boris turned again to Constantinople, thereby initiating a serious misunderstanding between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople which considerably added to the strain occasioned by the affairs of Ignatius and Photius. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> claimed the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> as inhabitants of ancient Illyricum (her former <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory) and as having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by her missionaries; Constantinople claimed that its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had converted the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, that the land was once imperial territory, and that the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> had given Constantinople the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for all barbarian countries. Between the two Churches the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which way to turn. They retained the Byzantine Rite, which, with its elaborate ceremonial, made a deep impression upon their child-like imaginations, and, formally, they submitted to Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, until they should have <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and a patriarch of their own. When, in 886, the disciples of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, expelled from <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> by King Swiatopluk, took refuge in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, they were received with open arms. The newcomers introduced into <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> the Byzantine Liturgy, but in the Slavonic tongue, whereas hitherto the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had used the Greek language. From <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> this Byzantino-Slavonic Liturgy spread among the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, the Russians, and all the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> peoples.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was originally established at Pereiaslaf, then was transferred to various centres in Western <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, finally to Ochrida (see <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">ACHRIDA</a>). In 1019 it was suppressed, when the town of Ochrida fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, or rather it was converted into an independent <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. As such it lasted until 1767 when it was definitively suppressed. However, independent <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> or autonomous archdiocese, the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church was from its foundation powerfully influenced by Constantinople; the long series of its Greek or Hellenistic <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> shared at all times the anti-Roman feelings of that city. The Russian Church is also a spiritual daughter of Constantinople (see <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">RUSSIA</a>). We need not relate here the conversion of that nation; it probably took place about 853, perhaps a little earlier, and both Latins and Greeks probably participated in it. Progress was very slow, however, and when the Czarina Olga wished to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> she had to go to Constantinople for instruction and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, on which occasion she took the name of <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a> (c. 956 or 957). Olga's conversion had no great influence; the czar, Sviatoslav (964-972), refused to yield to her wishes that he should also be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. It was not till 989 that Prince Vladimir allowed himself to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and ordered that his subjects should ever afterwards receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p>The Russian Church was probably organized at this time, and a Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> sent by the Byzantine patriarch was installed at Kiev, the Russian capital. Unfortunately, we have no <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notitia Episcopatuum"</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> contemporary with this event. The "Notitia" of 980 naturally makes no reference to Kiev, and the next "Notitia" goes from 1081 to 1118 only; in that year the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Kiev appears as number 60; similarly, in the "Notitia" of Manuel Comnenus which appeared about 1170. In this document Kiev appears as presiding over eleven suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, and this is the earliest information we have concerning the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the Russian Church. The head of this Church had a rather inferior place in the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, but exercised the prerogatives of an <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> and, once installed, administered freely his <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. He <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> its czars, and he usually resided at Kiev. Generally, a Greek was chosen for the office so that the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Russian Church was but an extension of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, sharing the liturgy, the dogmatic teaching, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antipathies of the latter.
<h3 id="D">Efforts towards reunion; the Crusades (eleventh to fifteenth century)</h3>

<p>In spite of the emperor and the Court, who favoured an understanding with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the West, <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> proclaimed his <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in 1054. He was followed by most of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, also by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the Greek people. Peter, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, held aloof from this violent measure, but died soon afterwards, and his successor went over to <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, usually resident at Constantinople, sided with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the capital; the Greek <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Ochrida was devoted to <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a> and was one of the first to stir up the question of the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">azymes</a> as a grievance against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Lastly, the head of the Russian Church was only a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> dependent on the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>. Therefore, with the exception of the insignificant <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who at first tried to agree with both parties, all the Greek Churches had taken sides against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> about the end of the eleventh century. In the years that elapsed from the death of Photius (891) to the fall of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> (1453) the anti-Roman <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Greek Church took definite shape. Photius was the first who attempted to co-ordinate all possible reasons of complaint against the Latins. He enumerated seven chief grievances: the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, the insertion of the "Filioque" clause in the Creed, the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the reconfirmation of those confirmed by Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Saturday fast, the use of milk foods during the first week of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The last three do not in any way affect <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and as much might be said of the second. The reconfirmation of those already confirmed seems to have been a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusation, unless some Latin missionaries <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> through excess of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. The primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had always been recognized by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the East, and by Photius himself, as long as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was willing to condescend to their wishes. The first letter of Photius to <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> does not differ from those of his predecessors, save for its more submissive tone and more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> diction. Appeals to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from the East between the second and ninth centuries are very numerous. And as for the Greek theory of the procession of the Holy Ghost, it was no new thing in the ninth century; <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> and St. Maximus of <a href="../cathen/03743a.htm">Chrysopolis</a> had favoured this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> long before Photius and were never accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. It would, therefore, have been easy to find a common ground or compromise that would have harmonized the teaching of both <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Passing from Photius to <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a>, we find only one new complaint directed against the Latins, and that <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>: the use of unleavened bread (see <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">AZYMES</a>). On this point the dispute was impossible of settlement, since each Church had been using its own particular kind of bread from time immemorial. Fresh differences in the meantime arose: the placing (about the thirteenth century) of the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiclesis</a> before the Consecration; <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, which the Greeks would not admit, although they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the dead and mortified themselves in their behalf; the full glorification of the just prior to the general judgment; the general judgment itself, which they rejected, as did also some Latin <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; the giving of communion to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> under one species; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by infusion. To all these differences were to be added in the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception and that of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>. Merely for the sake of recording them, we may mention <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> differences, as the manner of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, the adoption of a new calendar, the manner of making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> &#151; causes of offence which the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> took pleasure in keeping alive, and which made a deep impression on a people devoted to trifles and, generally, very <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.
<h3>Papal efforts at reunion</h3>

<p>The breach declared in 1054 has never been repaired. Yet this has not been the fault of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. As early as 1072 we find <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> eager for reunion. This attempt failed because of the unflinching opposition of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Michael Psellos, the Patriarch Xiphilinos, and their fanatical friends. Thenceforth until the fall of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> (1453) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> multiplied letters, embassies, and paternal advice to win back the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> Greeks to the fold of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and to keep them there on their return. All in vain. The two reconciliations effected by the Councils of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (1274) and of Florence (1439) were solely due to the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the Byzantine emperors. At Lyons Michael VIII, Pal&aelig;ologus, a clever politician, proclaimed himself and his people <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in order to save his crown and to stay the formidable armament of Charles of Anjou. At Florence John VII, Pal&aelig;ologus, came to beg men and arms from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to save his capital from the threatening <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. It would be difficult for an impartial historian to affirm the sincerity of their desire for religious union. One thing is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> followed them with the greatest reluctance, and at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> kept aloof from any union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and would not listen to it at any price. Michael Pal&aelig;ologus was hardly dead (1282) when his son Andronicus undid all that he had accomplished, and even denied religious burial to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>; moreover, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> patriarch, John Veccos, was deposed together with all his friends.

<p>John VII, Pal&aelig;ologus, who had agreed to the union at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, either could not, or did not dare, proclaim it in his capital. He feared either the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> or the intrigues of men like Mark of Ephesus, or George Scholarios. His brother, Constantine Dragases, the last of the Byzantine emperors, died heroically for his country. He, also, feared at the beginning of his reign to impose the union on his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. He had to wait until 12 December, 1452, hardly six months before the entry of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> into the capital, when Cardinal Isidore solemnly proclaimed the union of Florence in the church of Saint Sophia. Admiral Notaras cynically observed that the Greeks preferred the turban of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It must, however, be acknowledged that the seeds of union sown by the missionaries and by the envoys of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> have never been completely stifled. There have always been Greeks who were sincerely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, even in the darkest days of their country's history. Among them some have always defended with their pens, and often at the risk of their lives, the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and the primacy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Demetracopoulos, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has published a lengthy list of the principal anti-Roman writers among the Greeks, but it would be easy to prepare another very large work of the same kind exhibiting the pro-Catholic activity of many Greeks. John Veccos (Beccos), George Acropolites, Isidore of Kiev, <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, Arcudius, <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Allatius</a>, are names that carry weight with any unbiassed historian, and they had many disciples and imitators.

<p>With few exceptions the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have always leaned to the religious policy of recovering the East by every means of pacification and, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversy. This last means, however, was as a rule foredoomed to failure. Polemics have rarely converted anyone, and when carried on, as in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, with syllogisms and, above all, with insults and outrages, then, instead of conciliating and calming angry <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, they leave behind them only bitterness, asperity, and sometimes hate. If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, however, were misled in their choice of weapons, or rather, if their religious representatives in the East abused controversy and polemic, it must be conceded that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> stopped there. The violent solution of the Eastern question by the sword &#151; the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> which was to profit only the Westerns &#151; was no doing of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. In his stirring appeal at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont-Ferrand</a> that set afoot the first armed enterprise, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> exhorted the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Christians of the West</a> to save their brethren in the East, even before undertaking to free <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the Holy Sepulchre. Moreover &#151; it is almost too well known to need repeating here &#151; <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> denounced vigorously the diversion of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a> to an attack on <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> and Constantinople for the almost exclusive profit of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. From 1261 to 1282 (the <a href="../cathen/15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a>) Charles of Anjou was hindered from making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on Michael Pal&aelig;ologus and recapturing Constantinople solely by the influence of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>. It would therefore be an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to blame the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> for the abortive issue of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Had they been supported earnestly by East and West alike, <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> would have fared immeasurably better. Unfortunately, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> States, especially the Italian Republics, were too selfish to grasp the high moral and religious significance of the conduct and aims of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. As a rule, the only success of contemporary politicians was in embarrassing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The East, moreover, it must be admitted, did its share in frustrating the work of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Far from assisting the generous West in its sublime effort to save <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, the Greeks saw in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> only sources of profit for themselves or attempted to hinder their success. While their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and polemical writers showed more rudeness and spleen in controversy than did the Latins, their princes and emperors were likewise less disinterested than the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. It is to be carefully noted that the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> movement was by no means a complete failure. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>, in the eleventh century, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were in possession of Nic&aelig;a, within a stone's throw of Constantinople. Before the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> retreated, or at least ceased its conquests, in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and even in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And if in the fourteenth century it was enabled to resume its conquering march and cross into <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, a menace to <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian civilization</a>, it was in consequence of the cessation of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Nor must the foundation of the many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions in the East, which long outlasted the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, be reckoned as useless. It was their slow but continuous efforts that paved the way for the emancipation of many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> yoke, and brought about in those countries that increasing influence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion which we now behold. "More important perhaps", says M. Br&eacute;hier in "L'&Eacute;glise et l'Orient au moyen &acirc;ge: les Croisades" (Paris, 1907), p. 354, "are the results which the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> never dreamed of and which sprang from the contact of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> and the Orient. The very complex question as to what <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> civilization owes to the East cannot be discussed here; yet every day we find traces of the charm which the culture of the East exercised on <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> before and during the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. What we are most concerned with is the advance thus made in geographical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and, in consequence, in the spread of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> civilization by expeditions and travels in the East. <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> was really discovered in the thirteenth century by those Italian missionaries and merchants who were the guests of the Mongolian Khans. For the first time since the expedition of Alexander, countries which until then had remained in the penumbra of legend appeared as a reality." Literature, finally, owes much to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, which, by the literary relations they established between the Latin and Greek worlds, called forth the magnificent movement of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>.
<h3 id="A">Internal organization of Byzantine Churches</h3>

<p>We have already spoken of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Patriarchate of Ochrida, which about 1020 was changed into an autonomous Gr&aelig;co-Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> more or less Hellenized, and which, until its suppression in 1767, remained under the influence of Constantinople. Another <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, that of Tirnovo, was established in 1204 by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> from <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> for a long time. Gradually, however, it began to lean towards the Greeks, till it finally disappeared in 1393, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> all passed under the authority of the &oelig;cumenical patriarch. Something similar happened to the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>. Up to about 1204 they were on the most cordial relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, although it is probable that they recognized the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Constantinople. In 1217 Sabas the Younger <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his brother king in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name, and established a <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> Church which was at first composed of six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. It was recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> in 1219. In 1346 King Stephen Douchan threw off all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dependence on Constantinople and set up the Servian Patriarchate of Ipek, which, after many changes of fortune, was suppressed in 1766 and incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>. The Russian Church continued to depend on Constantinople through its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> at Kiev and at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> until 23 January, 1589, when the Byzantine patriarch, Jeremias II, publicly recognized its autonomy, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Job the first patriarch of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. From that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the Russian Church passes out of the purview of this article. It was not till the fourteenth century that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople succeeded in imposing upon the Rumanian people, who occupied the north bank of the Danube, a Greek <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> subject to itself. This was done through the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> of Alania and Bitzinia, or Soteropolis, with the later sees of Hungaro-Wallachia, Mauro-Wallachia (Moldavia), and Wallachia.

<p>During that troubled period which saw the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> in the East, the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> suffered especially. As long as the Latins remained undisputed masters of these regions, their Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> stubbornly opposed the coexistence of Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, so that the latter had no choice left but to take refuge in Constantinople at the Byzantine Court and to govern their Churches from there as best they could. This method soon became customary, and even after 1453 the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> continued to reside at the Phanar. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> alone returned soon afterwards to his own territory. In the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> ventured into Palestine, but it was not till the nineteenth century that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> left the shores of the Bosphorus. It must also be remembered that <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Crete (the latter being directly under Constantinople) were unable to have Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the long centuries that those islands remained in the hands of the Latius. It would be impossible within the limits at our disposal to give an exact description of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Constantinople from the tenth to the fifteenth century. A <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notitia Episcopatuum"</a> drawn up soon after 1453 reckons 72 <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>, 8 autocephalous archbishoprics, and 78 suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> divided among 21 ecclesiastical provinces or a grand total of 158 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. This relatively small number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is explained by the fact that <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> was then but an immense ruin, and that in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, in the majority of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> or <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> possessions, the presence of Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was not tolerated.

<p>Space forbids us saying more than a few words on the domestic history of the Greek Church. The election of the patriarch belonged by right to the Holy Synod; <em>de facto</em>, as we have seen, it was the Basileus or emperor, who elected him. Limited as was the authority of the Holy Synod, it could not always exercise what authority it had, and, on the death of a patriarch, the Basileus often appointed his successor without any previous consultation with the Synod. Nicephorus Phocas attempted to nullify any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> not approved by him, an abuse of power which lasted during his lifetime only. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> were elected by the Holy Synod, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and his suffragans, if they were sufficiently numerous, or, if not, with the assistance of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from another province. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had undergone no change since the earlier period, except that after the twelfth century we hear of no more <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, though some religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> hear that title without any right to it. Moreover, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> and B&oelig;otia, religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> no longer wore a lay habit or dress. "Commendation" and "charisticariats" were as common as in the West, with their train of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and vices still more hideous. The <em>mensa episcopalis</em> often found its way to the officials of the treasury or some other court functionary, and servility towards the State was the order of the day in all the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were obedient tools of the emperors. Yet there were not wanting <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> formed in the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> who had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to defend their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachment of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>.

<p>Monasticism was more and more popular throughout the Greek world. In Constantinople there were hundreds of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and every provincial town tried to rival the capital, so that the Byzantine empire became one vast <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>. Outside of Byzantium the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> formed into groups which surpassed the fame of the ancient solitudes of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and of Palestine. Without speaking of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, rich in Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, we must not omit to mention the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Mount Ossa, of the Meteora, of Phocis, and of the Peloponnesus. On Mount Olympus in Bithynia (the neighbourhood of Broussa, Nic&aelig;a, and Ghemlek) many religious centres sprang up. On a little corner of land, with a maximum length of 63 miles and a width of from 12 to 20 miles, a veritable oasis of monasticism came into existence, comprising at that time more than a hundred <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. These <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, usually very well filled, sheltered a number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> celebrities. Beginning from the tenth century, the peninsula of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> saw the rise of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> properly so called, and saw the cenobitic usage (community life) supplant the hap-hazard methods of earlier days. Then it was that vocations abounded, and the holy mountain was transformed into an earthly <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> known to have existed at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> between the tenth century and the thirteenth numbered more than a hundred. It was at this period, too, that the holy mountain played a preponderating part in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of Constantinople, and in the fourteenth century the <a href="../cathen/07301a.htm">Hesychastic</a> controversy, stirred up by its religious, became the dominating preoccupation of the time. There were many other active, though not so well-known, monastic centres &#151; e.g. Mount Latrus near <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, Mount Ganus, and Mount Galesius, Mount St. Auxentius near <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, the islands of the Archipelago and of the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, the region of <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, and especially the vicinity of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, with its picturesque laur&oelig; clinging to the slopes of the hills.

<p>The constant controversies with the Latins did not prevent the rise of other controversies that sometimes divided the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> into opposing camps just as in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> conflicts. We shall mention but a few. In 1082 a council condemned the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Italos, a subtile <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logician</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> had been refuted by the Emperor Alexius I, Comnenus. Four years later, Leo, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Chalcedon, was accused of giving to images the cultus of <em>latria</em>, due only to the Deity. In reality he had merely defended the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of his Church and prevented the emperor from carrying off the ornaments of beaten gold and silver from the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and images. After Leo came Nilos, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who had expressed some heterodox views concerning the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ. In a council of 20 August, 1143, the Bogomiles were condemned, together with many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who favoured them. In 1156 and 1157 two councils <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> Sotericus Pantengenius, Patriarch-elect of Antioch, who maintained that the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> was not offered up to the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, but only to the Father and to the Holy Spirit. Two other councils, held in 1166 and in 1170, explained the text, "The Father is greater than I", apropos of which many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were again falling into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Irenicus, suspected of various dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> was condemned in 1170. The thirteenth century is filled with the quarrel of the Arsenites or partisans of the Patriarch Arsenius, who had been deposed for condemning the <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">assassination</a> of young <a href="../cathen/09010b.htm">Lascaris</a> by Michael VIII, Pal&aelig;ologus. Originally a personal affair, it grew eventually into a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and canonical controversy.
<h3 id="B">Hesychasm</h3>

<p>With the fourteenth century we come upon <a href="../cathen/07301a.htm">Hesychasm</a> (<em>hesychia</em>, "quiet"), the greatest <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conflict of the Greek Church since the old times of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>. Gregory Sinaita first spread this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which he had learned from Arsenius of Crete.

<p>Intrinsically, it offers nothing very remarkable. It is based upon the well-known distinction between the practical <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, which purifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by cleansing it from its <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04329a.htm">contemplative life</a>, which unites the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and is thus the ideal and end of religious perfection. Four or five successive stages lead the disciple from the practical to the contemplative mode of life. But while there was nothing startling in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> principles of the new teaching, the method pointed out for arriving at perfect contemplation recalled the practices of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> fakirs, and was no more than a crude form of auto-suggestion. The alleged Divine splendour which appeared to the hypnotized subject, and was identified with that which surrounded the Apostles on Thabor, was really nothing but a commonplace illusion. Yet this Thaboric brightness, and the omphalopsychic method of inducing it, gave a widespread reputation to the <a href="../cathen/07301a.htm">Hesychasts</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the leaders of the party held aloof from these vulgar practices of the more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, but on the other hand they scattered broadcast perilous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> theories. Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine <em>propria</em> making it something uncreated and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. These monstrous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Palamas and the official recognition of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. He was declared the "holy doctor" and "one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church", and his writings were proclaimed "the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> guide of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>". Thirty years of incessant controversy and discordant councils ended with a resurrection of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> the most famous are the ninth-century Photius, well-known for his anti-Latinism; Michael Psellos, in the eleventh century, an all-round capable writer, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, philologist, historian, scientist, poet, and, above all, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; Euthymius Zigabenos, who composed, at the request of Alexius Comnenus, his "Dogmatic Panoply, or Armoury, Against all Errors"; Nicholas of Methona, Andronicus Cameterus, anti-Latin polemical writers, particularly <a href="../cathen/01239b.htm">Nicetas Acominatus (Akominatos)</a>, noted for his "Treasure of Orthodoxy". John Veccos (Beccos) and George Acropolites tried to reconcile the teachings of both Latins and Greeks while other Greeks opposed the Latins with all their might. Among the opponents of Palamas were Barlaam, Gregoras, Akyndinos, John the <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cypriot</a>, and Manuel Calecas. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conflict went on both before and after the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1439); Mark of Ephesus and George Scholarios repudiated the Roman <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which on the other hand, was adopted and upheld by <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, Isidore of Kiev, Joseph of Methone, and Gregory Mammas.

<h3>Relations with the Catholic Church, the Protestants, etc.</h3>

<p>The capture of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> marks the apogee of the &oelig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and the Greek Churches subject to it. By establishing <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Gennadius Scholarius</a> as the only patriarch of the Orthodox Churches within the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>, Mohammed II placed all the other peoples &#151; <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, Rumanians, <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albanians</a>, and Anatolians &#151; under the exclusive domination of Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the Servian and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Churches of Ipek and Ochrida still existed, but; pending their final suppression in 1766 and 1767 respectively, they were hellenized and under Greek control, so that they were in reality but an extension of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople. Moreover, the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> by Sultan Selim in the sixteenth century enabled the Greeks to control the honours and emoluments of the Patriarchates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Antioch. In the seventeenth century the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was hellenized, and that of Antioch in the opening years of the eighteenth century. As for Alexandria, where the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were very few, its Greek titular always resided at Constantinople. In this way the Greek Church gained gradual possession of the immense <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>; as the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> extended their conquests the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> extended with them. This situation lasted until the first half of the nineteenth century. The whole Orthodox world was at that time Greek, save in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, whose religious autonomy had been recognized in 1589, and in the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Empire, where <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> and Rumanians constituted, from the end of the seventeenth century, autonomous Churches, either <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or Orthodox. During the greater part of the nineteenth century the principle of nationality &#151; long cherished at Constantinople, which had employed it against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> when robbing them of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Illyricum and at one time over Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> &#151; was turned against the Greeks themselves, especially against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. Every province or kingdom that shook off the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> suzerainty freed itself at the same time from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> yoke of the Phanar. Curiously enough, it was the Greeks of the Hellenic Kingdom who first set up, in the nineteenth century, an autonomous Church. The <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> and Rumanians were not slow to imitate them. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> went farther and, while remaining Ottoman subjects <em>de jure</em> until October, 1908, they established about forty years ago an exarchate of their own, independent of the Phanar, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> not only over all <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, but also over <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in Turkey. It is to be expected that the recent proclamation of a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> kingdom will modify this state of things. A <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church may be established within the limits of that kingdom, and a second <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church within the limits of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The creation of a <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> Church for the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> in Turkey is also projected, so that the &oelig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> seems on the eve of dismemberment. In recent times, also, the rivalry of nationalities has passed over from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> into <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In 1899 the Greeks were ejected by the Syrians from the Patriarchate of Antioch; in the same way they may soon lose <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> similar divisions exist between the Greek- and Arabic-speaking elements; the latter, aided by their <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> fellow-countrymen, may eventually cast off the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control of the Greeks. In short, at no very distant date the Greeks, who have so long ruled the Orthodox world, will have to be content with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and the sadly weakened Church of Constantinople.

<p>If we look at the domestic situation of the Greek Church during the period from 1453 to 1901, the year of the present titular's accession, we find that, of a total of one hundred and two <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, only twenty-nine have died in possession of their see, and that the seventy-three others either resigned or were deposed. It is a strange phenomenon, seldom met except among the Greeks, that, whereas a patriarch was nominated for life, as a rule he was deposed or forced to resign. It sometimes happened that the same man became patriarch more than once. In this way, while between 1453 and 1901 there were only one hundred and two <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, there were some one hundred and sixty patriarchal elections; thirty-five <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> having been elected several times (twenty-one twice, nine three times, two four times, two five times, and one seven times). The last of these records is that of Cyril Lucaris, the famous seventeenth-century <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> patriarch. These continual changes gave rise to some amusing incidents. Thus on 19 October, 1848, Anthimus IV succeeded Anthimus VI, who was deprived of office the day before; at present Joachim III is &oelig;cumenical patriarch for the second time, twenty-three years after the death of Joachim IV who had succeeded him. This confusion is by no means peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. In the hellenized Church of Ochrida. we find between the years 1650 and 1700 no fewer than nineteen forced resignations or depositions of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. The two main causes of these sudden changes are the cupidity of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> covetous of the patriarchal throne. The cupidity of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> might never have been a factor, had it not been for the intrigues and cabals of the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> themselves, who put up their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> at auction. On 20 November, 1726, Pa&iuml;sios paid out 145,000 francs for the office of patriarch, and in 1759 the Sultan Mustapha III fixed the tax on the office at 120,000 francs. And yet in many instances the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> did not remain even a year in office. Later, when the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> had taken off the tax, depositions and resignations went on, and go on to this day as in the past, so much so that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> now come forward and ask that the duration of a patriarch's term in office be limited, e.g. to three or four years. However, in the Kingdom of Greece, where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> depends mainly on the State, these <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> do not occur. What has been said of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> might be even more truly said of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Though, according to Greek canon law, transfers from one diocese to another are forbidden or ought to be very rare, as a matter of fact every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has administered before his death four or five different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Either the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not find their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> suited to their dignity or the people did not find the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> suited to their taste. Of late the custom of lay interference in the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is growing, and hardly a year goes by in which seven or eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not removed at the request of their flocks. Nor must it be forgotten that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> busy themselves mainly with anti-Bulgarian or anti-Servian politics and other secular affairs. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government often has to request the withdrawal of some over-compromised <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>.

<p>It may be noted that the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; those of today at least-have received a fairly good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, followed by a very ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Halki or that of Santa Croce, near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Some of them have spent a few years in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academies of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is usually limited to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the points of controversy between Latins and Greeks from the beginning of their Church until recent times; they use it to bias the minds of their people against the missionary efforts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They are more tolerant of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. With the exception of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the towns, who aim at the higher offices, the Greek <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is very <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can hardly get through the Mass and the other services in a fitting manner. Although married, they retain great influence over the illiterate but <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> members of their flocks, who are attached to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by tradition or patriotism, and whose ill-instructed religious sense shows itself mainly in ritual observances and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices. With the exception of two or three <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, having about fifty pupils in all, there is no training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are divided, as with us, into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of various classes. Preaching is neglected and in many places is omitted altogether. For this reason in 1893 some <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> at <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> founded the Eusebia Society for the diffusion and explanation of the Word of God. This example has been followed in other places, especially at Serr&aelig;, <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, and Constantinople, where <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> preach in the churches as is the custom in some <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. The higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, far from favouring this movement, which is a reproach for them, do all they can to hinder it. Feast days are the same as in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>; so are the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, The latter are rarely received, and rather as a matter of custom than of genuine conviction. Communion is received four times a year after the four great <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>: at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, on St. Peter's day, on the Assumption, and at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. Confession ought to precede this solemn act, but as a rule it is omitted or treated so slightingly by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people that it is better not to speak of it. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> do not go to confession. Mass is heard on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Feast-days, or, rather, on those days the people go and say some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the icons, or <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a>, the services being generally so long that very few remain to the end. In any case there is no definite teaching on this point any more than on others, everything remaining vague and uncertain in the minds of the people.

<p>The music of the Greek Church began with the ecphonetic chant, a sort of recitative based on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of accent in prosody. Through the early melodists, or Syriac <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> poets, this musical notation may reach back to the ancient <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">liturgical chant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The musical characters or signs are Greek. The notation, known as that of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, is merely a development of ecphonetic notation. It increased the number of signs from nineteen to twenty-four. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> times a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>, John Koukouzeles, raised it to sixty or more; but in the early part of the nineteenth century Chrysanthos modified or simplified this excessively complicated notation; his "Theoretikon", a very instructive work, has become the basis or guide for all <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">liturgical chants</a> and scientific works thereon. Gregory Lampadarios and Chourmouzios aided Chrysanthos in his reform, which can hardly be called successful. It seems that all three misinterpreted certain old musical signs; moreover, they are responsible for the horrible nasal intonation so abhorrent to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>. However, musical reform is in the air; during the past thirty years it has been talked of, and plans have often been submitted, but so far without results. The <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">religious music</a> of the Russians is the only one that expresses any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Its gravity, unction, and sweetness are beyond question. If a <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">religious music</a> truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ever existed, the Russians have inherited it. Between Russian and Byzantine music there is no connexion whatever. (See also under <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">THE RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>.)

<p>Even after the taking of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the apostasy of the Greeks, the one aim of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> was to drive back the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> into <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and to save the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> in spite of themselves. Nicholas V, <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> all followed this policy. <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> sought to convert the Shah of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and to draw him into an alliance against the Sultan; the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> was the great concern of the whole pontifical life of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>. If the plan to drive back the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> into <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> finally failed, the fault lay not with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, but with the nations of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, jealous of each other and attentive to their own private gain rather than the interests of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It must not be forgotten that the victory of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (1571) was the work of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; that a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> worked for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/03244d.htm">Candia</a> (1669), and that, had it not been for another <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">John Sobieski</a> would never have relieved <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1683).

<p>From 1453 until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the relations between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were very different from what we find today. Cordial letters passed frequently between them; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of either rite were recommended to one another's care and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> often intervened in the internal affairs of the Greek Church. Many Greek Patriarchs of Constantinople &#151; among others, Cyril II &#151; and the Greek <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Ochrida, Porphyrius about 1600, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> in 1606, Abraham in 1629, Melecius in 1640, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> about 1660, professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; at different times many Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did in like manner. It would be impossible to say how far their conversion was sincere. Possibly the need of monetary help or the wish to make a stand against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was the motive power. It must at least be acknowledged that their conduct and attitude towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> gave evidence of genuine good will. Thus, to take some well-known examples, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were allowed to preach and hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> in the Greek Churches, by the express permission of the patriarch and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. That they made use of this privilege we learn from their correspondence. It is hard to explain the exact reason for the changed attitude of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries since the end of the eighteenth century. Perhaps the change came with the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> and the outburst of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, which led to the substitution of a new body of missionaries in the East. Today, as a matter of fact, missionaries of all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and every nationality observe rigidly the rules of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> concerning <em>communicatio in sacris</em>. They practically ignore the higher Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> &#151; not the best way, perhaps, to break down prejudice and win esteem. It is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that as a rule the higher Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are noted for their anti-Catholic fanaticism and are never weary of railing against Roman missionaries and of insulting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Then, too, the Greek people do not distinguish between religion and nationality, a confusion mainly due to the teaching of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; consequently, a Greek will refuse to become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lest he should cease to be a Greek. Yet great progress has been made during the past twenty or thirty years, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the French congregations which have been opened in nearly every town in Turkey. In spite of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> of the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, boys and girls flock to these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the consequence is a growing spirit of toleration and sympathy towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> everywhere.

<p><a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> tried to reopen official relations with the Greeks, but unsuccessfully. The reply of the Patriarch Anthimus VI to the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1848) was far from friendly; the invitation to assist at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> the Patriarch Gregory VI refused even to accept. During his long pontificate <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> was unceasing in his efforts to bring back the Greeks to unity, but they remained unmoved, and when, on 20 June, 1894, in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pr&aelig;clara", he invited the Greek Church in all charity to recognize the successor of Peter, the answering encyclical from the Patriarch Anthimus VII was remarkable for its rudeness. The present patriarch, Joachim III, opened a purely theoretical consultation with his subjects on the matter a few years ago, but his attempt was not well received.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> with whom the Greek Church sought to unite were the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. About 1560 the Greek <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Demetrius Mysos visited <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> to learn at first hand the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, but his visit had no result. In 1573 two professors of T&uuml;bingen, Andre&aelig; and Crusius, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Gerlach, opened a correspondence with the Greek patriarch Jeremias II, which lasted until December, 1581. The patriarch and his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> set forth over and over again very courteously and very fully the many dogmatic differences between their Church and that of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. At last Jeremias II refused to answer further letters and wrote to Pope Gregory XIII in June, 1582, that he "detested those men and their like as enemies of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church." Later on <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> doctrines found favour with the patriarch himself, Cyril Lucaris, who occupied the &oelig;cumenical throne seven times between 1612 and 1638. The French and Austrian Embassies sided with the Orthodox Greeks; Geneva and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> favoured the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinisers</a>. The conflict lasted through the greater part of the seventeenth century. The main quarrel was over Lucaris's confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, drawn up in Latin, which appeared at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> in March, 1629, and in the West stirred up both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Many councils of the Greek Church, especially those of Constantinople in 1638 and 1642, of <a href="../cathen/08325b.htm">Jassy</a> in 1642, and of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1672, extirpated the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from the Orthodox Churches. Through Peter Mohila, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kiev, the Russian Church took an active part in the controversy. The personalities that disfigured these disputes embittered the whole of the seventeenth century, and made it the most repulsive in the existence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. Four <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> at least were strangled, while in the space of one hundred years there were twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and fifty-four patriarchal elections, i.e. an average of one election every twenty-two months.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> came the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, or that section of them known as the <a href="../cathen/11099a.htm">Non-jurors</a>. Negotiations set on foot with the Greek and Russian Churches lasted from 1716 to 1725, but nothing ever came of them. Then came Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravian Brethren, 1740). Finally, in the nineteenth century we find the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Protestant Episcopalian Church of England</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> coquetting with the Greeks. In several <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> &#151; e.g., 1866, 1867, 1868 &#151; a desire for union with the Greeks was expressed, and the Patriarch Gregory VI showed sympathy, but did not hide the difficulties in the way of its immediate realization. At the Synod of Bonn (1874) the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> resolved to remove the "Filioque" from the Creed, to insert the formula "the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son", to recognize tradition as a source of revelation, to maintain that the Eucharist was a sacrifice, to admit <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>, and other points. But the Greeks would not make any concessions. In 1897 the 36th decision of the synod assembled at Lambeth Palace (London) charged the chief representatives of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a> to seek an understanding with Constantinople. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a> (who pays an annual visit to the &oelig;cumenical patriarch) were to be the principal negotiators. But the much-desired union is not yet a fact, the great drawback being the difficulty which both Churches find in defining exactly what they hold to be of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and what is only <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In 1902 the Patriarch Joachim III consulted the Orthodox Churches as to the usefulness of an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Churches</a>; nearly all those who thought it worth while to reply were opposed to the suggestion. Nevertheless there are several union <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in existence &#151; e.g., the Anglo-Continental Society, founded in 1862, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> Association, and others similar &#151; but so far they have effected nothing. On the other hand, Evangelical <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of various countries have been very active in the East, and have often called forth protests from the higher Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. While their success among the Greeks has not yet equalled their success among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, their unceasing propaganda in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> has ended by creating Greek centres of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, something hitherto unheard of.

<p>The Old-Catholics from the beginning aimed at union with the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. Theological conferences were held at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> in 1874 and 1875 with that object in view, and both parties made concessions, but nothing came of these efforts. Although frequent conferences have since been held, an Old-Catholic Committee instituted at Rotterdam, and the "Revue Internationale de Th&eacute;ologie," established at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> (1893), the negotiations for union have not made the slightest advance.

<p>With all the Orthodox churches, except the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> exarchate and the Syrian Patriarchate of Antioch &#151; both of them considered <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> for substituting a native episcopate to a Greek one &#151; the Greek Churches are on terms of union arising from a common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a common <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. By the canons of the &oelig;cumenical councils of 381 and 451 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople enjoys a sort of pre-eminence over the other Churches. But this must not be understood to mean a pontifical primacy so that the head of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> may command with authority the faithful of all other Churches. The Byzantine patriarch has a primacy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> but not of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; he is foremost among his equals &#151; <em>primus inter pares</em> &#151; and no more. This oft-repeated declaration was renewed at the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1867, which proclaimed that the Orthodox Churches recognized only an &oelig;cumenical council as their supreme master and sovereign judge. When Joachim III, in 1902, wished to consult the other Churches on matters concerning the whole Orthodox party &#151; e.g., union with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> or Old-Catholics, the reform of the calendar, and other matters &#151; out of thirteen Churches five were not consulted, being in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or manifestly unfavourable; two did not reply; six replied in the negative. Again in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, since 1900, the attempts of the &oelig;cumenical patriarch to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of that Church are resented; at the present time (1909) his authority is being overthrown at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, just as at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. There is therefore no unity of authority among the Orthodox Churches. Nor is there any unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or discipline. The <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and the Syrians of Antioch, who are looked on as schismatics by the various Greek Churches, are not such in the eyes of the other Orthodox Churches. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> uphold the validity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> administered by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; the Greeks say such <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is invalid. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> do not admit the deuterocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, but the Greeks, until quite recently, accepted them. It would be easy to multiply examples. Formerly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to send the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> to all Orthodox Churches as a sign of Orthodox unity and of their dependence on Constantinople. But since the seventeenth century, at least, the Russian Church <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> its own <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, and sends it in our day to the Churches of Montenegro, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and Antioch. The three Orthodox Churches within the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Empire <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> their own <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, as does also the Rumanian Church since 1882. So that the only Churches now receiving the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> from Constantinople are those of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and Servia. The moral authority of the &oelig;cumenical patriarch over the other Churches is null; consequently it stands to reason he has no dogmatic privileges. The decrees of the first seven &oelig;cumenical councils alone have force of law. As a rule, a number of creeds are also considered as instructive concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, e.g., the confession of the <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Patriarch Gennadius</a>, that of Peter Mohila, the decrees of the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1672, the confession of Metrophanes Critopoulos. At present these confessions are not held to be <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, but merely guides in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Greek religious literature since 1453 is mainly polemical, against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Literary interests, once so popular at Byzantium, have long been quite secondary. Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> re-edit continually the most fiery controversial treatises, accentuate the causes of separation between the two Churches, and on occasion invent others. Such, in the fifteenth century, are the writings of Maximus of Peloponnesus and George Scholarius; in the sixteenth century, of Maximus Margunius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cythera, and of Gabriel Severus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philadelphia; in the seventeenth century of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, Cyril Lucaris, of George Coresios, Theophilos Corydaleos, half <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and half <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, Meletius Syrigos, Doritheus of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Nicholas Kerameus of Janina, and Pa&iuml;sios Ligarides; in the eighteenth century the writings of the brothers Joannikios and Sophronius Lichoudes, who laboured especially in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Chrysanthus of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Elias Miniates, Eustratios Argentis, etc. Apart from this truculent <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, always fairly numerous among the Greeks, there are but few historians and chroniclers, e.g., Manuel Malaxos, who wrote a history of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from 1458 to 1578; Dorotheus of Monembasia, who drew up a chronological table from the creation to 1629, and Meletius of Janina or of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> (died 1714), their only historian of note. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were the most conscientious workers and tireless editors: Nicodemos the Hagiographer, of amazing productivity; Agapios Landos, his rival; Eugenios Bulgaris, the most learned Greek of the eighteenth century; &OElig;conomos, Meletius Typaldos, Gregory of <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>, and many others.

<p>There are few living <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writers of note in the Greek church. Philotheos Bryennios, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, who rediscovered and edited the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles", is the only one deserving of mention. It is no less strange than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that within nearly a century only one manual of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> has appeared in Greek, a volume of about 450 pages published at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> in 1907 by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, M. Androutsos &#151; an index of the esteem that <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> enjoys in the Greek Churches. They have, however, translations of Russian, German, or English works, and in this way <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are creeping in. The same might be said of other branches of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The only good manual of canon law is by a <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Milasch; the manuals of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> by an Athenian <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, Diomedes Kyriakos, and by Mgr. Philaretes, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Dimotika, are merely translations or adaptations of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> works. Among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> there are some learned men, e.g., Spiridion Lambros, C. Sathas, A. Papadopoulos-Kerameus, and M. Gedeon. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> take no interest in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, nor, as a rule, in anything <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>. Politics and dull personal intrigues are their only concern. In this respect the coming generation will perhaps differ from their predecessors. Two reviews have been started: the "Nea Sion" (New Sion) at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the "Church Beacon" at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, but both are carried on in a spirit of controversy, and the impartiality and scientific honesty of many of the editors are not above question. The Phanar review, "Ecclesiastical Truth", is only a church weekly.

<p>I have not touched on the religious spirit of the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, for as a rule it is sadly deficient; nor on its missions, for there are none; nor its present monastic life, confined to <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> and no more than a recitation of endless <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> interspersed with local intrigues. Other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> exist only in name; they are now, for the most part, farms managed by a so-called <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and supplying funds to <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a> or elsewhere. Owing to the energy of the lay element, who take an active interest in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, there are many well-conducted primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. We have only praise for the efforts of both sexes to create and support <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and of benevolence. On this score the Greeks are inferior to no people.
