<h1>Greek Orthodox Church in America</h1>  

<p>The name <em>Orthodox Church</em> is generally used to distinguish those of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> who are not in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It is a name common to the official designation of both Churches of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> or dissenting Churches lay great stress upon the word <em>Orthodox</em>, and its implied meaning of correctness of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Churches</a> lay equal emphasis upon the word <em>Catholic</em>. Hence these divisions of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> are respectively called the "Greek Orthodox" and the "Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" for convenience in designation. The Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> is now well established in America, and nearly every city of considerable size has one or more churches of the various nationalities belonging to that communion. There is no <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a> among them nor any obedience to a central authority; they conform to the general usages and discipline of the Byzantine Rite, but look to their respective Holy Synods in their home countries for governing authority and direction. Seven nationalities have their churches here, using the Old Slavonic, the Greek, the Arabic, and the Rumanian as their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages and of these the Russian is the oldest and best established.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Russian Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>The Russian Church has been established upon American (formerly Russian) territory for over, a century. In this connexion the word <em>Russian</em> refers to <em>rossiisky</em> (of the Empire of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>), and not <em>russky</em>, which may be translated either Russian or <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>. In 1793 a band of eight missionary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was sent out from St. Petersburg to <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>, and the first Russian church was built on Kodiak Island in 1794. In 1798 the first missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joasaph, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. In 1804 the fort and city of New Archangel (now Sitka) was founded on the island of Sitka. In 1812 the Russians made a settlement in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>; Russian Hill, in <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, is still a reminder of them. In Alaska they converted many of the <a href="../cathen/05539a.htm">Eskimo</a> and Indians, and the success of their missions was such that in 1840 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Ivan Veniaminoff was made the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of "Kamchatka, the Kuriles and Aleutians", and took up his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Sitka. In 1867, just before Alaska was sold to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, he was made <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> his advice was of great assistance in the negotiations for the transfer of <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>. After him the title of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was changed to "Aleutia and Alaska". In 1872 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was changed from Sitka to <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and a Russian <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> built there. The Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in America have been Paul (1867-70), John (1870-79), Nestor (1879-82), Vladimir (1883-91), Nicholas (1891-97), and Tikhon (1897-1907). In 1900 the title of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was changed to "Aleutia and North America", and an assistant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was appointed for Alaska. In 1905 Bishop Tikhon changed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> to New York City, and in the year 1906 the Russian Holy Synod raised him to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> with the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a> and a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>. In 1907 he was succeeded by the present Archbishop Platon, a former member of the Russian Duma.

<p>Until within the last twelve years the Russian Church was hardly known in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> being wholly confined to its Pacific shores. In New York between 1870 and 1880 there was a Russian Orthodox <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on Second Avenue, established by the Rev. Nicholas Bjerring, but it failed for lack of a congregation and support by the Russian authorities. Father Bjerring <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> before his death. The first great impulse to the establishment of the Russian Church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> on a large scale was given in 1891, when the late Rev. Alexis Toth, then a <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Minneapolis, disobeyed the instructions of Archbishop Ireland and, when threatened with a recall to his native country, left his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, turned Orthodox, and submitted to Bishop Nicholas, and on returning to Minneapolis took over his whole <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. He afterwards tried, in 1892, to take over the entire congregation and <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> of St. Mary's Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. The transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was prevented by the courts, but over half the congregation seceded. Toth became an able and energetic advocate of the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> of America, succeeded in arousing the Holy Governing Synod of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to the opportunity to spread Orthodoxy and Panslavism among the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in America, and became a most bitter opponent of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. He was made a mitred protopriest for his efforts and is said to have been the cause of nearly 10,000 secessions from the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. In 1900 the whole Orthodox movement was put under the direction of the "Orthodox Missionary Society of All-Russia", which, together with the Holy Synod, supplies extensive funds and numerous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for its development here. In 1902 a fine Russian <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (St. Nicholas) was built in New York City, and Russian churches have begun to spring up everywhere in the Atlantic States, particularly in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Numerous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were brought from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> opened in Minneapolis, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in South <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the rites of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> were celebrated with a magnificence and splendour before unknown in America, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself put on a solid basis. In 1908 the whole <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> were divided into five great <em>blagochinnia</em>, or deaneries: New York, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, the Western States, and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, each one having from ten to twenty churches, and there was besides the <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Diocese of Alaska</a>. In March, 1909, the Russian Church adopted an elaborate Constitution (<em>Normalny Ustav</em>) of sixty-four paragraphs, defining the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, thus creating a local canon law for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, subject to the Holy Synod in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. This is the more remarkable when there are but few Russians (from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>) in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The latest figures (1909) for the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> in America are: Russians, 7974; Galician <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, 11,045; Hungarian <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, 5820; Bukovinians, 4180; making a total of 29,019. Besides these there are in Alaska: Indians, 1891; Aleutians, 2149; Eskimo, 3666. The Orthodox Russian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (1909) consist of one <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, 2 protopriests, 2 hegumens, 15 monastic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 70 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and 40 cantors. Three of these are in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and fifteen in <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>. They have 60 churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 10 in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and 17 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>. They have a large church <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> very much like the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> ones, the "Pravoslavnoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi" (Orthodox Mutual Aid Society), with 133 brotherhoods and 3950 members. Two church journals are published, "Amerikansky Pravoslavny Viestnik" (American Orthodox Messenger), in Great Russian, and "Svit" (Light), in <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>. Their tone is bitter towards Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and in many <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> they excite dissension.


<h2 id="section2">Greek Hellenic Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>Greek immigration was confined to the hundreds until 1890; the immigration figures for 1905-08 are: Greece, 77,607; Turkey, 19,032. The first <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek church</a> (<a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>) was opened in New York City in 1891 by Rev. P Ferentinos from <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>. Subsequently the new church on East 72nd Street was acquired, in which they have erected one of the finest Greek interiors &mdash; the altar, iconostasis and throne being of Pentelic marble. The Greeks have begun to build fine churches. There are (1909) about 130,000 Greeks in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> chiefly in the Eastern and Middle States, and they publish eighteen newspapers, including two dailies. They have 32 churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and 2 in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, some &mdash; like <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> of Lowell, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a> &mdash; of considerable importance. Their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consist of 7 <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and 25 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, but the churches are in the main governed by the lay trustees and particularly by the president of the board. Of these Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 15 are subject to the Ecumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople and 20 to the Holy Synod of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. This circumstance and the fact that a part of the Greeks come from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire and the other part from the Kingdom of Greece have given rise to many dissensions and prevented the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, neither the patriarch nor the Synod wishing to cede such an appointment to the other. On the other hand, they both decline to admit or recognize the authority of the Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> here.
<h2 id="section3">Syro-Arabian Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>These are Syrians of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> who use the Arabic language in their liturgy. They are nearly all from the Patriarchate of Antioch, which just now is quasi-schismatic towards Constantinople but closely affiliated with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. They of course began to immigrate to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at the time that the other Syrians, <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, came. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> have greatly assisted them in building churches and establishing missions here, and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Raphael of <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The first Syro-Arabian church (St. Nicholas) was built in Brooklyn in 1902, and has since become their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consist of the Syro-Arabian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom three are <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. They have (1909) churches in the following localities: Brooklyn and Glens Falls, New York; <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and Lawrence, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>; Pittsburg, Johnstown, and Wilkesbarre, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kearney, Nebraska; Beaumont, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. There are said to be about 50,000 Orthodox Syrians in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but they are quite scattered. They have frequent dissensions with their fellow-Syrians, the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> and <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, who are Uniats. They publish two Arabic newspapers in the interest of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and have a number of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in New York and elsewhere.
<h2 id="section4">Servian Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>This is composed of immigrants from <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and Montenegro. They all speak that southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> language, the Servian, which is identical with the Croatian, except that it is written in the Russian alphabet to which are added two or three letters unknown to Russian, whilst the Croatian (used by, the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholics</a>) is written with Roman letters. The Russian, the Servian, and the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Churches use the Old Slavonic language in the Mass and church offices. The <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> are mainly in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and the West, and the first church was built by the Archimandrite Sebastian Dabovitch in Jackson, Cal. (1894). The Servian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> is closely affiliated to the Russian Church in this country, except that some of their churches do not recognize the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or authority of the Russian <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. There are about 70,000 or 80,000 <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, and Washington. Their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consist of one <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a>, five <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and four <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and they have churches in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Illinois; Pittsburg, McKeesport, Wilmerding, Steelton, and Johnstown, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; Kansas City, Kansas; <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver, Colorado</a>; Jackson and Los Angeles, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>; Butte, <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>; St. Louis, Missouri. They also publish three Servian papers, and have several church <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, the chief one "Srbobrar".
<h2 id="section5">Rumanian Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>About half the Orthodox Rumanians in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> come from <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> and half from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Their immigration has been all within the past decade, both in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. They are also under divided <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, those from <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> being under the Holy Synod of Rumania and those from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Hermannstadt. There are about 30,000 Orthodox Rumanians at the present time (1909) in America, including <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Their first church was St. Mary's, built in 1907 at <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. They have, besides several missionary stations, five churches situated at the following places: <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> Harbor, Illinois; Cleveland and Youngstown, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; Sawyer, <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North Dakota</a>; Regina, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> &mdash; one <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> and four <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> &mdash; three are from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> and two from <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>. It is a noticeable fact that these two branches of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Orthodox, have harmonious relations and attend all Rumanian celebrations together, where matters of their race and language are concerned.
<h2 id="section6">Bulgarian Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>Bulgarian immigration into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has only recently been in any considerable numbers. While the majority come from the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, a great many are also from <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, in Turkey. They dislike the Greeks very much, and while the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> contingent of them is nominally under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, they recognize only the Exarch of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. Neither will they affiliate with the Russian Church authorities here. While there are considerable numbers in New York City, yet they have settled chiefly in <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a> and Missouri, and are scattered also farther westward. The first <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church (Sts. Cyril and Methodius) was built in 1908 by the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Theophylact at Granite City, Illinois. There is also another one near St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, and one is being built at Madison, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, while there are several mission stations. There are about 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in this country. They publish two papers in their language and have several church <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, but have no national organization.
<h2 id="section7">Albanian Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>The Albanians use the Greek language in their liturgy, there having been no version into their very difficult tongue. They come from <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a> in the southern Balkans and from Epirus and northern Greece. They are also known as Arnauts and call themselves in their own language <em>skipetar</em>, "mountaineers" (see <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">ALBANIA</a>). They are, of course, the same race which formerly <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and whose descendants now form the majority of the Italian Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Albanian immigration to America has been quite recent, but there are now some 15,000 here, mostly settled in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a> and in New England. Although they use the Greek language in their liturgy and have attended the Hellenic <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, they have no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Greeks. In February, 1908, the Russian <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Aleutia and North America <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> the Rev. F. S.  Noli, a young Albanian, in New York City as an Orthodox <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and established him as missionary for his people in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Russian Holy Synod has taken steps on his initiative towards translating the Greek Liturgy into Albanian. They have a small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> and missions in New England, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and Missouri. Endeavours have been made by them to attract the Italo-Greeks from their <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> rite, on the ground of their being also of the Albanian race in America.
