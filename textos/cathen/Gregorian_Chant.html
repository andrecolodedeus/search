<h1>Gregorian Chant</h1>  

<p>The name is often taken as synonymous with <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain chant</a>, comprising not only the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> music of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, but also later compositions (elaborate melodies for the Ordinary of the Mass, sequences, etc.) written in a similar style down to the sixteenth century and even in modern times. In a stricter sense Gregorian chant means that Roman form of early <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain chant</a> as distinguished from the Ambrosian, <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican</a>, and Mozarabic chants, which were akin to it, but were gradually supplanted by it from the eighth to the eleventh century. Of the Gallican and Mozarabic chants only a few remains are extant, but they were probably closely related to the Ambrosian chant. Of the latter, which has maintained itself in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> up to the present day, there are two complete <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> belonging to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries respectively, and a considerable number belonging to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. An incomplete <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> belongs to the twelfth century. It is at present in the British Museum and has been published in the fifth volume of the "Pal&eacute;ographie musicale". All these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> contain the chants both for the Office and for the Mass. The Office chants are <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> and responses, as in the Roman books. The Mass chants are <em>Ingressa</em> (corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, but without psalm), <em>Psalmellus</em> (Gradual), <em>Cantus</em> (Tract), <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, <em>Transitorium</em> (Communion), and, in addition, two <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> having no counterpart in the Gregorian Mass, one <em>post Evangelium</em>, the other the <em>Confractorium.</em> There are, further, a few <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> verses and <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> <em>ante Evangelium.</em> Musically it can easily be observed that the syllabic pieces are often simpler, the ornate pieces more extended in their <em>melismata</em> than in the Gregorian chant. The Gregorian melodies, however, have more individuality and characteristic expression. Though it is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether these Ambrosian melodies date back to the time of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, it is not improbable that they represent fairly the character of the chant sung in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Gaul at the time when the <em>cantilena romana</em> superseded the earlier forms. The frequent occurrence of cadences founded on the <em>cursus</em> at all events points to a time before the latter went out of use in literary composition, that is before the middle of the seventh century. (See Gatard in "Dict. d'arch. chr&eacute;t.", s.v. "Ambrosien (chant)" and Mocquereau, "Notes sur l'Influence de l'Accent et du Cursus toniques Latins dans le Chant Ambrosien" in "Ambrosiana", <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1897.)

<p>The name <em>Gregorian chant</em> points to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (590-604), to whom a pretty constant tradition ascribes a certain final arrangement of the Roman chant. It is first met in the writings of <a href="../cathen/15629b.htm">William of Hirschau</a>, though <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> (847-855) already speaks of the <em>cantus St. Gregorii.</em> The tradition mentioned was questioned first by Pierre Gussanville, in 1675, and again, in 1729, by George, Baron d'Eckhart, neither of whom attracted much attention. In modern times Gevaert, president of the <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> music <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, has tried to show, with a great amount of learning, that the compilation of the Mass music belongs to the end of the seventh or the beginning of the eighth century. His arguments led to a close investigation of the question, and at present practically all authorities, including, besides the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, such men as Wagner, Gastou&eacute;, and Frere, hold that the large majority of <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain-chant</a> melodies were composed before the year 600.

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for a <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregorian</a> tradition may be summarized thus: <ul> <li>The testimony of <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> biographer (c. 872), is quite trustworthy. Amongst other considerations the very modest claim he makes for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, "antiphonarium centonem. . . compilavit" (he compiled a patchwork <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonary</a>), shows that he was not carried away by a desire to eulogize his hero. There are several other testimonies in the ninth century. In the eighth century we have Egbert and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> (see Gastou&eacute;, "Les Origines", etc., 87 sqq.). The latter, in particular, speaks of one Putta, who died as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 688, "maxime modulandi in ecclesia more Romanorum peritus, quem a discipulis beati papae Gregorii didicerat". In the seventh century we have the epitaph of Honorius, who died in 638 (Gastou&eacute;, op. cit., 93): <blockquote> . . . . divino in carmine pollens <br>Ad vitam <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> ducere novit ovis <br>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br>Namque Gregorii tanti vestigia iusti <br>Dum sequeris culpiens meritumque geris </blockquote>

<p>-- that is: "Gifted with divine harmony the shepherd leads his sheep to life . . . for while following the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">holy Gregory</a> you have won your reward." According to this it was thought in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, less than forty years after the death of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, that the greatest praise for a music-loving <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to compare him to his predecessor <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>. <li>The feasts known to have been introduced after <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> use in the main melodies borrowed from older feasts. See the detailed <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for this in Frere's "Introduction". <li>The texts of the chants are taken from the "Itala" version, while as early as the first half of the seventh century <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> correction had been generally adopted. <li>The frequent occurrence in the <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain-chant</a> melodies of cadences moulded on the literary cursus shows that they were composed before the middle of the seventh century, when the <em>cursus</em> went out of use. </ul>
