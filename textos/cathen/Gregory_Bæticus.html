<h1>Gregory B&aelig;ticus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Elvira, in the province of Baetica, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, from which he derived his surname; d. about 392. Gregory is first met with as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Elvira (Illiberis) in 375; he is mentioned in the Luciferian "Libellus precum ad Imperatores" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XIII, 89 sq.) as the defender of Nicean creed, after Bishop <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a> had given his assent in <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> to the second <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> formulation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, in the year 357. He proved himself at any rate an ardent opponent of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, stood for the Nicean creed at the <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a>, and refused to enter into ecclesiatical intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Bishops Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>. He took, in fact, the extreme view, in common with Bishop Lucifer of <a href="../cathen/03139c.htm">Calaris</a> (Cagliari), that it was unlawful to make advances to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who at any time had been tainted with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a>, or to hold any religious communion with them. This Luciferian party found adherents in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and on the death of Lucifer (370 or 371) Gregory of Elvira became the head and front of the movement. Such at least is the mention found of him in the "Libellus precum" above referred to, as well as in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> chronicle (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L. XXVII, 659). However, the progress made in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was by no means considerable.

<p>Gregory found time also for literary labours. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says of him that he wrote, until a very ripe old age, a diversity of treatises composed in simple and ordinary language (<em>mediocri sermone</em>), and produced an excellent book (<em>elegantem librum</em>), "De Fide", which is said to be still extant (Hieron., <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 105</a>). The book "De Trinitate seu de Fide" (Rome, 1575), which was ascribed to Gregory B&aelig;ticus by Achilles Statius, its first editor, did not come from his pen, but was written in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> at the end of the fourth century. On the other hand early historians of literature, e.g. <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, and quite recently Morin, have attributed to him the treatise "De Fide orthodoxa", which is directed against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and figures among the works of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XVII, 549-568) and of Vigilius of <a href="../cathen/14556a.htm">Thapsus</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXII, 466-468; 449-463). The same may be said of the first seven of the twelve books "De Trinitate", the authorship of which has been ascribed to Vigilius of <a href="../cathen/14556a.htm">Thapsus</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXII, 237-334). A few inquiring commentators have also sought to prove that Gregory B&aelig;ticus was the writer of the tractatus "De Libris Sacarum Scripturarum", published by Batiffol (Paris, 1900) as the work of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. But so far it has been impossible to ascertain positively the authorship in question. There is preserved a letter to him from <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius of Vercelli</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., X, 713). As from <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius of Vercelli</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., X, 713). As <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, in his "De Viris Illustribus", written in 392, does not mention Gregory as being dead, the supposition is that the latter was still living at the time. He must, however, have been then a very old man and cannot in any event have long survived the year 392. He is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> being celebrated on 24 April.
