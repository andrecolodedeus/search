<h1>Gregory Martin</h1>  

<p>Translator of the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douai Version of the Bible</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>; b. in Maxfield, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Guestling, near Winchelsea, in Sussex; d. at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 28 October, 1582. In preparing the translation he was assisted by several of the other great scholars then living in the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, but Gregory Martin made the whole translation in the first instance and bore the brunt of the work throughout. He was well qualified for the undertaking. During his thirteen years' residence at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, he bore the reputation of a brilliant scholar and linguist, whose abilities were only equalled by his industry. He entered as one of the original scholars of St. John's College, in 1557. Among those who entered at the beginning was <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Edmund Campion</a>, the renowned <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. At this period of his life, however, he was possessed with the ambitions of youth, and although at heart a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he conformed to the Established Church, and even accepted <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Gregory Martin was his close friend throughout his Oxford days, and himself remained a devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. When he found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to quit the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, he took refuge as tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Duke of Norfolk, where he had among his pupils <a href="../cathen/07503a.htm">Philip, Earl of Arundel</a>, also subsequently <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. During his residence with the Duke, Martin wrote to <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a>, warning him that he was being led away into danger by his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, and begging him to leave Oxford. It is said that it was in great measure due to this advice that <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> migrated to Dublin in 1570, and accepted a post in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> there. He continued to conform to the established religion outwardly; but his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiments were no secret.

<p>In the meantime, Gregory Martin left the house of the Duke of Norfolk, and crossing the seas, presented himself at Dr. Allen's College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> as a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in 1570. During his early days there, he wrote once more to <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a>, who yielded to his entreaties, and the following year saw the two friends once more united within the venerable walls of the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> was now a professed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and he received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>, after which he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and eventually entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Having finished his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, Gregory Martin was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in March, 1573. Three years later he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist Allen in the foundation of the English College there, known by the title of the "Venerabile". <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a>, however, was at that time absent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Martin remained two years, during which time he organized the course of studies at the new college; when he was recalled by Allen to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, whither the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had been removed from <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in consequence of political troubles. Martin and <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> met once more in this world, when the latter made a short stay at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in the summer of 1580, on his way to the English Mission, and&mdash;as it turned out&mdash;to early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>It was during the next four years after his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that Gregory Martin's brilliant talents and scholarship found full scope in a work destined to be of far-reaching and permanent utility to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The need of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> had long been felt, in order to counteract the various inaccurate versions which were continually quoted by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and as Allen said, to meet them on their own ground. He determined to attempt the work at his college, and deputed Martin to undertake the translation. <a href="../cathen/15713b.htm">Thomas Worthington</a>, Richard Bristowe, John Reynolds, and Allen himself were to assist in revising the text and preparing suitable notes to the passages which were most used by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>The merits and shortcomings of Martin's translation have been discussed in the article on the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douai Bible</a>. It is sufficient here to say that it was made from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and is full of Latinisms, so that it has little of the rhythmic harmony of the <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">Anglican Authorized Version</a> which has become part of the literature of the nation: but in accuracy and scholarship, it was superior to any of the English versions which had preceded it, and it is understood to have had great influence on the translators of King James's Version. In many cases in which they did not follow the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douai</a>, the editors of the Revised Version have upheld Gregory Martin's translation. And it was accuracy of rendering which was chiefly needed by the controversial exigencies of the day.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> first appeared in 1582. The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was not published till more than a quarter of a century later. This, however, was solely due to want of funds. It was not called for with such urgency, and its publication was put off from year to year. But it was all prepared at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and by the same editors.

<p>The constant work told on Martin's constitution, and he was found to be in consumption. In the hope of saving his life, Allen sent him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he consulted the best physicians of the day, only to be told that the disease was past cure. He returned to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> to die, and he was buried in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen. Allen preached the funeral discourse, and erected a long Latin inscription on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of his friend. The following is a list of Martin's works: "Treatise of Schisme" (Douai, 1578); "Discovery of the Manifold Corruptions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> by the Heretikes of our Daies" (Reims, 1582); <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Reims Testament and Douay Bible</a>; "Treatise of Christian Peregrination" (Reims, 1583); "Of the Love of the Soul" (St. Omer, 1603); "Gregorius Martinus ad Adolphum Mekerchum pro veteri et vera Gr&aelig;carum Literarum Pronunciatione" (Oxford, 1712); several other works in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/12120a.htm">Pitts</a>.
