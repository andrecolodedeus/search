<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Gregory VIII</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">Antipope</a>. He was Mauritius Burdinus (Bordinho, Bourdin), who was placed upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair by <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a>, 8 March, 1118. Bourdin was a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, born probably at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>. He received a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Cluny, and followed his fellow-Benedictine, Bernard, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, beyond the Pyrenees. At a time when Cluny stood for learning and reform, his advancement was assured. In 1098, he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a> (<a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>); in 1111, he was raised to the Metropolitan See of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. Three years later, in consequence of a quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, he was suspended by Paschal II. Coming later to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he so ingratiated himself with the pontiff, who was also a Cluiac, that he was retained at court and employed on weighty affairs. In 1117, when Henry came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to force his terms upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Paschal, safe in <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, sent Bourdin with some <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to negotiate with the emperor. This mission proved to be the downfall of Bourdin. Seduced from his Gregorian principles, he openly espoused the cause of Henry, and, to emphasize his apostasy, placed the crown upon the emperor on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>. He was promptly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; but was marked out for the supreme dignity by his new associates. A few months later, when Henry, learning of Paschal's death, hastened to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, surrounded by jurists, only to find that he had been outwitted by the vigilance of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, failing to capture Gelasius, he declared the latter's election null, and, after a discourse by the learned <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius of Bologna</a> on imperial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, induced a bribed assembly of Romans to proclaim Bourdin <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who with unconscious irony took the name of Gregory. The honours of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> turned to ashes in his hands. Repeatedly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and finally delivered as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> into the hands of <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, he was detained in several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> until his death about 1137. Thus ended the career of a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> "whom", says <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> (Gesta Regum Angl., V, 434), "everyone would have been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to venerate and all but adore on account of his prodigious industry, had he not preferred to seek glory by so <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> a crime". One of the canons of the Ninth General Council, 1123, declares all ordinations made by him after his condemnation, or by any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by him <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, to be irritoe.
