<h1>Gregory of Heimburg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a> and Statesman, b. at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in the beginning of the fifteenth century; d. at Tharandt near <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, August, 1472. About 1430 he received the degree of Doctor of Both Laws at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>. Filled with the prevalent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of reform, this ardent and eloquent jurist was naturally attracted to the Council of Basle, convened, according to the assembled <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, for "the extirpation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>. . . .and for the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her Head and members". While at the council he became the secretary of &AElig;neas Sylvius. He left Basle in 1433, when he was elected syndic of Nuremburg, in which capacity he served until 1461. After the election of Albert II of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, he was sent, with John of Lysura to the Council of Basle to demand that the proceedings against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> be suspended, and then to <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> to propose that the negotiations with the Greeks be carried on in a German city. In 1446 he was again placed at the head of an embassy to <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had deposed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, both electoral princes, who favoured the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>. The other electors now demanded of Eugene (1) his approval of certain decrees of Basle; (2) the convocation of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> in a German city within three months; (3) the acceptance of the article on the superiority of the council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and (4) the reinstating of the two deposed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. But Gregory's mission was unsuccessful. On the advice of Frederick III the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent Cardinals Tommaso de Sarzana and <a href="../cathen/03393c.htm">Carvajal</a>, with <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the Diet of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 14 Sept., 1446. With them was &AElig;neas Sylvius, now the private secretary of Frederick III. Some of the electors were won over to the cause of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; a new embassy was organized; and in February, 1447, shortly before the death of Eugene, the four <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> constituting the Concordat of the Princes was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. In February, 1448, a complete agreement was reached in the Concordat of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, concluded between Frederick III and <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>. Gregory, who had considered even the declaration of neutrality and ignoble concession, was disappointed at this turn of events and decided to abandon <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> politics. During the negotiations between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the electors there appeared the anonymous "Admonitio de injustis usurpationibus paparum" or, as Flacius entitles it, "Confutatio primatus pap&aelig;", which is generally ascribed to Gregory.

<p>In 1458 Gregory entered the service of Albert of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and his opposition to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority was again aroused. &AElig;neas Sylvius had ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> the same year, and soon afterwards (1459) summoned the princes of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to Mantua to plan a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Gregory was present as the representative of Bavaria-Landshut, Kurmainz, and the Archduke Albert of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The failure of the project was partly due to his influence. Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, on his return from the Congress of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, with whom he was quarrelling over certain fiefs. He was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> 1 June, 1460, and through Gregory of Heimburg appealed to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. Gregory went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but to no avail, and on his return journey posted the duke's appeal on the doors of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Florence. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him and ordered the Council of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> to confiscate his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (18 October, 1460). Gregory answered in January, 1461, with an appeal to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> renewed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and commissioned Bishop Lelio of Feltre to reply to Gregory's appeal. The "Replica Theodori L&aelig;lii episcopi Feltrensis pro Pio Papa II et sede Roman&acirc;" brought forth from Gregory his "Apologia contra detractationes et blasphemias Theodori L&aelig;lii" together with his "Depotestate ecclesi&aelig; Roman&aelig;", in which he defended the theories of Basle. His next important writing, "Invectiva in Nicolaumde Cusa", appeared in 1461. Shortly before the death of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> in 1464, Sigismund made his peace with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but Gregory was not absolved. In 1466 he was taken into the service of George Podiebrad, King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and exercised a great influence on the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king's anti-Roman policy. In two apologies for Podiebrad Gregory <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Pope Paul II</a>, whom he charged with immorality. He was again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at Dettlebach confiscated. After the death of Podiebrad (22 March, 1471) Gregory took refuge in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. Writing to the Council of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> as early as 22 January, 1471, he said he was never accused of having <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in one article of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He applied by letter to <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, who gave the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> full power to absolve him. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the Kreuzkirche at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>. His writings were published at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> in 1608 under the title "Scripta nervosa justiaque plena ex manuscriptis nunc primum eruta". They may be found in Goldast, "Monarchia", in Freher, "Scriptores rerum Germanicarum", and in Joachimsohn (see below).
