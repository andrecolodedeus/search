<h1>Gregory of Rimini</h1>  

<p>An Augustinian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in the second half of the thirteenth century; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1358. After completing his studies, he became professor and subsequently <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in his native city. But it was not long before he was called to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to take a professorship at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, where he achieved great distinction as a teacher. He was one of the chief leaders of the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> in the controversy over the nature of "universals", and his disciples conferred most respectful titles on him, such as <em>Doctor acutus</em>, <em>Lucerna splendens</em>, and especially <em>Doctor authenticus</em>. Many people even called him "beatus" not only out of esteem for his remarkable erudition, but for his heroic and virtuous qualities. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> he belonged naturally to the older Augustinian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> founded by the Augustinian &AElig;gidius of Colonna, commonly known as the <em>Schola Aegidiana</em>. In some respects, however, his views diverged from those of the founder of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. For, while the latter's views on the disposition of sinners towards grace by no means coincide with the opinions of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and are far more nearly akin to Semipelagianism, Gregory on the other hand was a most pertinacious champion of the teachings of this <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and had no hesitation in opposing the general teaching of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> with respect to the need for grace in fallen man and the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, even though the &AElig;gidian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> followed in general <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. These views of Gregory found many <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> supporters again in the seventeenth century, <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Cardinal Noris</a> in particular defending them vigorously. Gregory's opponents delighted to call him the "Infantium Tortor" (Tormentor of children), because he held, in opposition to the other <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, the severe and extreme views concerning the fate of children who died unbaptized. In 1357 he succeeded the equally famous <a href="../cathen/14695c.htm">Thomas of Strasburg</a> as General of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a>, but died the next year at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Of his writings, the "Commentaries" on the "Books of the Sentences" have appeared in print (Lectura in primum et secundum librum Sententiarum, Paris, 1482, 1487; Milan, 1494; Valentia, 1500; Venice, 1518); also a treatise on the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> (De usuris, <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, 1522, 1622). Commentaries on the Epistles of St. James and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> are also attributed to him.
