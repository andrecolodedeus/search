<h1>Gregory of Valencia</h1>  

<p>Professor of the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, b. at Medina, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, March, 1550 (1540, 1551?); d. at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 25 April, 1603. The "Annales Ingolstadiensis Academiae" formally announce in 1598: "During the current year the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> lost a celebrated man and a veteran teacher, Gregory of Valencia, who left Ingolstadt 14 Feb.; the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> had summoned him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take part in the discussions concerning grace which were to be held in presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When Duke Maximilian heard of this he requested Gregory to travel to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, where supplied him with horses, servants, and money for the journey, thus showing his high regard for the man who, during twenty-four years, had rendered such important services to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause in general." In its tribute to him the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty has this statement: "Gregory of Valencia, S.J. a native of Medina, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was sent by his superiors to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1598. He was a peer among the learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his time; <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was eager to secure him as was also Stephen, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; he was an ornament to our <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in which he spent twenty-four years; for sixteen years as professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> he gave general satisfaction and contributed to the progress of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. In the controversies of the day, he took a prominent part, combating <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and always with success, by means of his polemical writings. His work in four volumes, covering the whole field of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a number of years and held the position of prefect of studies in the Roman College until, broken in health through incessant work, he died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, at the age of fifty-four years. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him with the significant title of <em>Doctor doctorum</em>.

<p>If this estimate of his age (54) be correct &#151; and it coincides with the necrology of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> province of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> &#151; it would follow, since March is given as the month of his birth, that he was born in March, 1550. <a href="../cathen/02191c.htm">Southwell</a> in his "Biblioth. scriptorum S.J." says he was born in 1551, but he also states in two different places, "mortuus, anno aetatis 63" from which it would appear that Gregory was born in 1541. The date of his reception into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, however is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In 1565 Gregory was at Salamanca studying <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. Attracted by the preaching of Father Ramirez, S.J. he sought admission into the recently founded <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> 25 November of the same year under the guidance of Father Balthasar Alvarez, one of the spiritual directors of St. Teresa. After finishing his studies, but not yet <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> he was called in 1571 by <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, superior general of the order, to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In a short time his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> attainments and his ability as a teacher attracted such widespread attention that after the death of <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a> and the election of his successor, Mercurian, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> tried to secure Gregory for <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> work while the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> desired his services for that country. He was ultimately affiliated with the German province and appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, Father Hoffaus, to the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, whence, two years later, he was transferred to a similar position at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. Here he remained seventeen years (1575-1592) teaching <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, during fifteen of which he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of studies.

<p>This period was marked by intense religious ferment. Not only did the anti-Catholic movement started in that century continue, but the conflict among the various sectarian leaders, especially after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> death, became sharper. Lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> had to be adapted to the altered circumstances of the times both in defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and in refutation of numerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. That Gregory realized the need of this course is evident from the dissertations produced under his direction and the disputations that were held by candidates for the doctor's degree at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. But what he chiefly aimed at was the positive construction of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, as he shows in his commentary on the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa Theologica"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> which contains the substance of the lectures he delivered during many years. After resigning his professorship at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, he devoted most of his time (1592-97) to the revision and publication of these lectures. They appeared under the title "Commentariorum theologicorum tomi quatutor"; the first volume was published at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> (1591); a second edition of this appeared in 1592 together with the second volume; the third was published in 1595, the fourth in 1597. After another revision by the author they were republished in 1603, and again in 1611 after the author's death. Other editions appeared at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1600-08; Lyons, 1600-03-09-12. It was one of the first comprehensive <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works produced among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. These editions brought out in such rapid succession attest the high rank occupied by this work in contemporaneous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature. Its distinctive features are clearness, comprehensiveness, and depth in the treatment both of speculative and moral subjects.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as professor, however, had not hindered him from publishing many polemical essays. These were directed principally against Jakob Heerbrand, who was a professor at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> adherent of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. The catalogue of the "Ingolstadter Annalen" (Mederer, II, 156) enumerates eight publications of this sort. Their principal purpose was to defend the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, e.g. "Apologeticus de Idololatria, adversus impium libellum Jacobi Herbrandi etc." (Ingolstadt, 1579); an enlarged edition was published in 1580. In the same year he published "De sacrosancto Missae sacrificio contra impiam disputationem Tubingae nuper a Jac. Herbrando propositam etc.", which was followed by the "Apologia de SS. Missae sacrificio" (Ingolstadt, 1581). Later he edited his polemical writings on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, attacking the ubiquity theory of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> champion Jacob Schmidelin and the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> Crell and Sadeel (surnamed Chandieu) concerning the Sommervogel (in the Biblioth&egrave;que de la Comp. de J.) enumerates forty polemical pamphlets written by Gregory, many of which, however, are only compilations of various theses which formed the basis of disputations for the doctorate. In 1591 he published at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> a collective volume of his controversial writings with a preface (dated 4 Sept., 1590) saying that in response to the demand for his polemical writings he had collected, revised, added some later treatises, arranged the whole in a certain <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> order and put them at the disposal of his publisher at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, that place being the most likely centre for the purpose of distribution. After Gregory's death, this volume was republished (Paris, 1610) with over one hundred additional pages (unnumbered) of indexes. It was entitled: "De rebus fidei hoc tempore controversis". its weightiest and most comprehensive treatise is without a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the "Analysis Fidei Catholica" which had been published first in 1585. This is a methodical demonstration that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is founded solely in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and that union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the only guarantee of right <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. As a <em>demonstratio catholica</em>, it retains its value to the present day.



<p>It is worthy of note that the last two volumes culminated in the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. In fact some of Gregory's theses not only foreshadow but express wellnigh literally the <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">dogmatic definition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870, e.g. "In the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> himself is vested the authority which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> possesses to pass judgment in all controversies regarding matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whensoever the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> makes use of his authority in defining matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are bound by Divine precept to accept as <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that which he so defines. And they must further believe that he is using this authority whensoever, either in his own right or in union with a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he decides upon controverted matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in such wise as to make the decision binding upon the whole Church". Gregory also became a leading factor in other discussions, for instance, the theologico-economical questions of the so-called "five per cent contract" which caused consciences astray. Even then the modern capitalistic system was nascent, though <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions had not yet reached the stage where money to any amount could be profitably invested and interest rightfully demanded on loans simply as such. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> remained firm in its stand against <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and insisted that if interest were to be charged it should be put on some other basis than the mere fact of borrowing and lending. But as in passing upon the validity of different additional titles varying degrees of strictness were exercized, there resulted serious and even extreme differences in the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and in the practice of the confessional; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves contradicted one another in their decrees on this subject; and meantime the five percent contract became the general custom.

<p>During the last decades of the sixteenth century, confusion in matters of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was widespread, especially in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Duke William of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who was personally in favour of strictly enforcing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, called on the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> for a ruling and eventually besought the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to settle the question. In both the decisions Gregory played a conspicuous part. He sought to have the practice of taking interest declared lawful on the basis of the so called <em>contractus trinus</em> and of a rental-purchase agreement which either party was free to terminate. (The latter arrangement had been devised and quite generally resorted to during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as a method of lending money without contravening the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in regard to interest. It grew out of the earlier practice whereby the creditor acquired both possession and use of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which secured the loan. By a later modification, the borrower retained possession and use, but ceded to the lender a real right in the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Finally, the system here referred to was introduced, the creditor was entitled to an income from the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which, however, still belonged to the borrower; the lender purchased the rental. Originally such agreements were binding in perpetuity; but in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> they were so framed that the parties might withdraw under mutually accepted conditions). He argued that contracts surrounded by such provisions were not contrary to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and were therefore permissible in all cases where no positive law forbade them. He also advocated these views as collaborator in the opinion which a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> commission, by order of Gregory XIII, elaborated in 1581. It was in connection with this matter that Gregory's superiors sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his personal acquaintance with conditions in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> would enable him to state all the more accurately the question at issue and its significance. On other matters of importance also he was consulted by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and by his own superiors in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> question Gregory unfortunately did not have the grasp of the situation subsequently shown by Friedrich von Spee of the same <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Sorcery he thought was a frequently occuring fact; hence in the opinion which he expressed in 1590, he aimed, not to set aside the juridical procedure then in vogue, but simply to temper the undue severity of its application. Still it was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to reproach him for the statement (Commentarii, div. III, col. 200S, sqq.), that where the guilt (of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>) is legally established the judge must inflict penalty even though he were personally convinced of the nullity of the charge.

<p>In this matter Gregory only followed the then prevalent teaching taken from <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, viz. that a judge's <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and private <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> should not be allowed to affect his official decisions; in the special case of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> Gregory could not consistently make an exception. This opinion indeed is controverted; it seems to grate on natural feeling; but this apparent harshness vanishes when we further consider what is laid down by the adherents of this view, especially Gregory, in their treatment of the more general question, namely that a judge is under grave <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to make all possible use of his private <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> towards securing the acquittal of the accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and if needs be to refer the case to a higher court or to endorse and support a well-grounded plea for clemency. That Gregory meant this principle to apply in the case of condemnation for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a> is quite obvious; moreover, in the very passage for which he is criticized (III, 2009), he refers to an earlier part of his work (III, 1380) in which he discusses the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a judge. In 1592 Gregory resigned as professor at Inglostadt to devote himself more fully to the editing of his "Commentarii theologici". In 1598 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>. A more important work, however, awaited him there; the vindication of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society's</a> teaching on grace. A book by Molina (d. 1600) entitled "De Concorida liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis etc." had created a stir. On many points in which it set forth essentially the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding grace, it was suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and was formally denounced by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> ordered both parties to debate the matter publicly before him and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>. Acquaviva, the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, selected Gregory as champion of the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>At the first public disputation, 20 March, 1602, Gregory had to prove that Molina had not deviated from St. Augustine's teaching by any undue extension of man's freedom. He maintained his position so ably against the objections of Father Didacus Alvarez, O.P., that friend and opponent alike awarded him the palm. Then the method of debate was changed. Isolated statements taken from Molina's book had to be compared with similar passages all through the works of St. Augustine. It turned out to be a laborious and seemingly endless undertaking. The second debate was not held until 8 July. Tomas de Lemos was selected to represent the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in this and in most of the subsequent debated (9 July, 22 July, etc.). The ninth occurred 30 Sept. Gregory's bodily strength, already reduced by illness and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> strain, gave way at the close of this debate, although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, contrary to custom, had permitted him to remain seated during his discourses. He was sent to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in the hope that his health would be restored and the debates were discontinued for a month and a half, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> having expressed the wish that Gregory would be able to continue the defence. Only when this seemed hopeless were the public discussions resumed. Pedro Arrubal was then selected to take Valencia's place. The assertion that Gregory had tampered with certain texts of St. Augustine and had fainted when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> charged him with it, is as mythical as the rumour that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> poisoned <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> for fear lest he should pronounce their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.
