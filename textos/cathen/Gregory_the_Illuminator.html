<h1>Gregory the Illuminator</h1>  

<p>Born 257?; died 337?, surnamed the Illuminator (Lusavorich).

<p>Gregory the Illuminator is the apostle, national saint, and patron of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. He was not the first who introduced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into that country. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> maintain that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was preached there by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> Bartholomew and Thaddaeus. Thaddaeus especially (the hero of the story of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar of Edessa</a> and the portrait of Christ) has been taken over by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, with the whole story. <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> in their version becomes a King of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>; thus their land is the first of all to turn <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, even <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> before St. Gregory. The south <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and Nisibis especially, which accounts for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> adoption of the Edessene story. A certain <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (248-265) wrote them a letter "about penitence" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.46</a>). This earliest Church was then destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid dynasty (226), restored, even extended, the old power of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, always the exposed frontier state between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, was overrun by Ardashir's army (Khosrov I of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> had taken the side of the old <a href="../cathen/01753f.htm">Arsacid</a> dynasty); and the principle of uniformity in the Mazdean religion, that the Sassanids made a chief feature of their policy, was also applied to the subject kingdom. A Parthian named Anak <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> Khosrov by Ardashir's orders, who then tried to exterminate the whole <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> royal family. But a son of Khosrov, Trdat (Tiridates), escaped, was trained in the Roman army, and eventually came back to drive out the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> and restore the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> kingdom.

<p>In this restoration St. Gregory played an important part. He had been brought up as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> at Caesarea in Cappadocia. He seems to have belonged to an illustrious <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He was married and had two sons (called Aristakes and Bardanes in the Greek text of Moses of Khorni; see below). Gregory, after being himself <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by King Trdat, who at first defended the old <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> religion, eventually converted him, and with him spread the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> throughout the country. Trdat became so much a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> that he made <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the national <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the nobility seem to have followed his example easily, then the people followed &#151; or were induced to follow &#151; too. This happened while <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> was emperor (284-305), so that <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to her claim of being the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> State. The <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> were made into churches and the people <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in thousands. So completely were the remains of the old <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathendom</a> effaced that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> practically nothing about the original <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> religion (as distinct from Mazdeism), except the names of some gods whose <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> were destroyed or converted (the chief temple at Ashtishat was dedicated to Vahagn, Anahit and Astlik; Vanatur was worshipped in the North round Mount Ararat, etc.). Meanwhile Gregory had gone back to Caessarea to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. Leontius of Caesarea made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>; from this time till the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> depended on Casearea, and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> (called Catholicoi, only much later <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>) went there to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. Gregory set up other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the land and fixed his residence at Ashtishat (in the province of Taron), where the temple had been made into the church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "mother of all <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> churches". He preached in the national language and used it for the liturgy. This, too, helped to give the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church the markedly national character that it still has, more, perhaps, than any other in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Towards the end of his life he retired and was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> by his son Aristakes. Aristakes was present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">First General Council</a>, in 325. Gregory died and was buried at Thortan. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built near his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were afterwards taken to Constantinople, but apparently brough back again to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Part of these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are said to have been taken to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> during the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast troubles</a>.

<p>This is what can be said with some <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> about the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>; but a famous life of him by Aganthangelos (see below) embellishes the narrative with wonderful stories that need not be taken very seriously. According to this life, he was the son of the Parthian Anak who had <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> King Khosrov I. Anak in trying to escape was drowned in the Araxes with all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> except two sons, of whom one went to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the other (the subject of this article) was taken by his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nurse to Caesarea and there <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Gregory, in accordance with what she had been told in vision. Soon after his marriage, Gregory parted from his wife (who became a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>) and came back to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Here he refused to take part in a great sacrifice to the national gods ordered by King Trdat, and declared himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He was then tortured in various horrible ways, all the more when the king discovered that he was the son of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> murderer. After being subjected to a variety of tortures (they scourged him, and put his head in a bag of ashes, poured molten lead over him, etc.) he was thrown into a pit full of dead bodies, poisonous filth, and serpents. He spent fifteen years in this pit, being fed by bread that a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> brought him daily. Meanwhile Trdat goes from bad to worse. A holy virgin named Rhipsime, who resists the king's advances and is <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, here plays a great part in the story. Eventually, as a punishment for his wickedness, the king is turned into a boar and <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed by a devil</a>. A vision now reveals to the monarch's sisters that nothing can save him but the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Gregory. At first no one will attend to this revelation, since they all think Gregory dead long ago. Eventually they seek and find him in the pit. He comes out, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcizes</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> and restores the king, and then begins preaching. Here a long discourse is put into the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> mouth &#151; so long that it takes up more than half his life. It is simply a compendium of what the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church believed at the time that it was written (fifth century). It begins with an account of Bible history and goes on to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and all the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> up to <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> times are refuted. The discourse bears the stamp of the latter half of the fifth century so plainly that, even without the fact that earlier writers who quote <a href="../cathen/01204a.htm">Agathangelos</a> (Moses of Khorni, etc.) do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, no one could <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is the composition of an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of that time, inserted into the life that was already full enough of wonders. Nevertheles this "Confession of Gregory the Illuminator" was accepted as authentic and used as a kind of official creed by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church during all the centuries that followed. Even now it is only the more liberal <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> among them who dispute its genuiness.

<p>The life goes on to tell us of Gregory's fast of seventy days that followed his rescue from the pit, of the conversion, and of their journeys throughout the land with the army to put down <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods fight against the army like men or <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, but are always defeated by Trdat's arms and Gregory's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and are eventually driven into the Caucasus. The story of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and of the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is told with the same adornment. He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> four million <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in seven days. He <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and sent out twelve apostolic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and sons of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Eventually he ruled a church of four hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> too numerous to count. He and Trdat hear of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Constantine's</a> conversion; they set out with an army of 70,000 men to congratulate him. Constantine, who had just been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Pope Silvester, forms an alliance with Trdat; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> warmly welcomes Gregory (there are a number of forged letters between Silvester and Gregory, see below) &#151; and so on. It would not be difficult to find the models for all these stories. Gregory in the pit acts like Daniel in the lion's den. Trdat as a boar is <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>; the battles of the king's army against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and their gods have obvious precedents in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Gregory is now Elias, now Isaias, now <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, till his sending out his twelve apostles suggests a still greater model. The writer of the life calls himself <a href="../cathen/01204a.htm">Agathangelos</a>, chamberlain or secretary of King Trdat. It was composed from various sources after the year 456 (see Gutschmid, below) in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, though sources may have been partly Greek or Syriac (cf. Lagarde). The life was soon translated into Greek used by <a href="../cathen/10225a.htm">Symeon Metaphrastes</a>, and further rendered into Latin in the tenth century. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> this life was the invariable source for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> history. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and Uniates) keep the feast of their apostle on 30 September, when his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were deposed at Thortan. They have many other feasts to commemorate his birth (August 5), sufferings (February 4), going into the pit (February 28), coming out of the pit (October 19), etc. (Niles "Kalendarium Manuale", 2nd ed., Innsbruck 1897, II, 577). The <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> keeps his feast (<em>Gregorios ho phoster</em>) on 30 September, as do also the Syrians (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, I, 290-292). <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, in September, 1837, admitted his namesake to the Reman Calendar; and appointed 1 October as his feast (among the <em>festa pro aliquibus locis</em>).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">AGATHANGELOS'S Life of St. Gregory was published in Armenian by the MECHITARISTS at Venice, in 1835 (reprinted at Tiflis, in 1882); translated into french and Italian (Venice, 1843). the Greek text was edited by STILTING in the Acta SS., Sept.
