<h1>Grey Nuns of the Cross</h1>  

<p>A community founded in 1745 at Monteal by <a href="../cathen/15736c.htm">Madame d'Youville</a>, known as the Grey Sisters, or <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>, from the colour of the costume. Just one century later, February, 1845, at the request of Bishop Phelan, <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, Mother General McMullin sent four sisters to ottawa, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, then Bytown, in the <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Diocese of Kingston</a>. Schools being the greatest need at Bytown, two classes were opened without delay, Sisters Elizabeth Bruy&egrave;re and Helen Howard being the first teachers. Over one hundred and fifty pupils attended. This was the beginning of the well-known Sacred heart or Rideau Street Boarding School. At the same time, a sister in charge of the sick poor organized the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> into helping centres. providentially a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was in working order when the ship-fever victims arrived from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the famine year of 1847. Teaching and the works of mercy are on a footing in this community. The <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> undertake any needed good work. Their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> receives choir <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and lay sisters. The institute has so steadily increased that it has in <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, in addition to Rideau Street <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, two high schools and sixteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The teachers hold <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">summer schools</a>, attend the normal <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">summer school</a> and qualify for the highest diplomas.

<p>Attached to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> is the first training-school for nurses formed in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. There are also five homes for children and the aged poor, supported by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> offerings and a government allowance. In Hull, opposite Ottawa, are large <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, academic and elementary. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> will be opened in September, 1909. At Hudson Bay is an Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the Crees; along the ottawa River from its upper waters are three boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, ten <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and five <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; at Lake St. Peter, in Quebec province, are two boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and an Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the Abnaki. In 1857, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened in Holy Angels <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, N.Y. it is situated on Porter and prospect Avenues and has had a very successful history.

<p>In 1860 a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and academy was founded at Plattsburg, N.Y. A <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, governed by the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> principal and supported by the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> funds, existed until the "Garb-question" caused the sisters to withdraw. Plattsburg School Board sent protest in vain to Albany. There was but one answer; the exciting garb must be discarded. But the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> still exists, supported by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1863 a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>, N.Y., in the old Ford mansion, on a beautiful site, facing the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. It is now a home for the homeless. St. Mary's or the Cathedral <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a> is second to none under the Regents. At the World's Fair it was accorded a medal in the exhibit of the University of New York. The sisters have also two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Odgensburg. Since 1881 Lowell and Haverhill, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, have had <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> proclaimed <a href="../cathen/15736c.htm">Mother d'Youville</a> venerable. Her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> is being considered at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As she, the first Grey Nun, chose the Cross as her emblem, and the object of her special devotion, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> named her faithful daughters "Grey Nuns of the Cross", a title limited to the Ottawa foundation only, the headquarters of the houses mentioned above.
