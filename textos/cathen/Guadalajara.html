<h1>Guadalajara</h1>  

<p>(Guadalaxara)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in Mexico, separated from the <a href="../cathen/10282a.htm">Diocese of Michoacan</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, 31 July, 1548. The residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was first fixed at <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>, in the Province of <a href="../cathen/14513b.htm">Tepic</a>, but in 1560 was transferred by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> to Guadalajara. Since its foundation the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> has had a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, of twenty-seven members between 1830 and 1850, but at present (1908) they number only seventeen. The present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun in 1571, completed and dedicated in 1618, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1716. It contains a celebrated <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>.

<p>Among its notable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionary, Felipe Galindo y Ch&aacute;vez, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1695, and died in 1702. He founded in 1699 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and gave it its constitution and a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> exerted his influence towards securing the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, entrusted the missions of Lower California to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and made two visitations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as far as the neighbourhood of Coahuila. Nicol&aacute;s Carlos G&oacute;mez de Cervantes, a canon of Mexico, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Guatamala in 1723, was transferred to Guadalajara in 1725 and died in 1734. He made a visitation of the whole diocese, strengthened the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> missions, founded in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> de Bexar, and assisted in building <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Francisco de S. Buenaventura Martinez de Texada Diez de Velasco was the first Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a> and built the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Augustine, Florida; later he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a> (1745), and was transferred to Guadalajara in 1752. He twice visited the whole of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, made generous donations of church ornaments and <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> to indigent <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and aided in the erection of many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. He died in 1760. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Antonio Alcalde, born in 1701, a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> in arts, master of students, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> for twenty-six years, and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his order, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a> in 1763, and was transferred to Guadalajara in 1771. There he founded the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> (S. Miguel de Bel&eacute;n) for five hundred sick poor; he also improved the standard of teaching in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of S. Juan Bautista, founded and endowed the girls college called El Beaterio, and placed it under the care of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. It was this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who built the sanctuary of Guadalupe, and left funds to defray there the expenses of worship. Another very large bequest left by him was for the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. He introduced various industries to improve the condition of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and during the great famine (1786) supported a multitude of destitute <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. After spending $1,097,000 on <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he died, 7 August, 1793, a poor man &mdash; "the father of the poor and benefactor of learning".

<p>Juan Cruz Ruiz de Caba&ntilde;as, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> (Spain), became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11046a.htm">Nicaragua</a> in 1794, and of Guadalajara in 1796. He gave new constitutions to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and founded there new classes, also the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> college and the hospice for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, established moral conferences for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, fostered agriculture and the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and was instrumental in popularizing the practice of vaccination. It was he who <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Iturbide emperor in 1824.

<p>Pedro Espinosa, born in 1793, was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and a dignitary of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Guadalajara in 1854, and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1863. He was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> on account of his vigorous defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being banished for that reason by the Liberal Government. He placed the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> under the care of the Sisters of Charity. Pedro Loza, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a> in 1852, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Guadalajara in 1868, assisted at the Council of the Vatican, and died in 1898. He was the initiator of the system of free <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; he improved the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to a remarkable degree, gave it its present building, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 536 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and built the churches of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores and San Jos&eacute;.

<p>The population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is about 1,200,000; it contains 83 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 5 of which are in the episcopal city. The once numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> were suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>; the Government, assuming the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of ownership of the conventional buildings, converted most of them into barracks and afterwards alienated the remainder. Some of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustinian, and <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarian</a> religious remained as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the churches that had been their own. In the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> building of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at Zapopan there is a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for young men under the direction of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, expelled by Charles III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1767), did not return until 1906, when they founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in the city of Guadalajara. The Religious of the Sacred Heart have for some years carried on a girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, having, in consequence of Liberal legislation, lost its own building, acquired the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Monica, which Archbishop Loza began to rebuild in 1891. Besides many other illustrious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, no fewer than thirty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been trained in this establishment, which has now (1908) 1000 students. In the cities of Zapotlan and San Juan de los Lagos there are auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Free primary instruction is established in all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the archdiocese. At Guadalajara there is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supervision, also several <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> supported by charity. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and endowments of S. Miguel de Bel&eacute;n and the hospice for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, foundations of former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, were seized by the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>.
