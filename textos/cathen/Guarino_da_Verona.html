<h1>Guarino da Verona</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, b. 1370, at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; d. 1460, at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. He studied Latin in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Giovanni da Ravenna, and afterwards went to Constantinople, where he studied Greek under <a href="../cathen/09614a.htm">Manuel Chrysoloras</a>, in whose household he spent five years. In 1408 he returned with more than fifty Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he was received with great enthusiasm. The rest of his life was spent in teaching and lecturing with extraordinary success in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and other Italian cities. His method of instruction was so celebrated that students flocked from all parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and even from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to his lecture-room. Many of them, notably <a href="../cathen/15490a.htm">Vittorino da Feltre</a>, afterwards became well-known scholars. In 1429 he was engaged by Niccolo d'Este, Marquess of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, as tutor to his eldest son Lionello. After devoting several years to Lionello's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he was appointed professor of rhetoric in the University of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (1436), a post which he held for many years. The last thirty years of his life were spent in teaching at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, where he acted as interpreter between the representatives of the Greek and Latin Churches at the council of 1438. A master of Greek and Latin, Guarino was endowed with a wonderful <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> and an indefatigable industry. Moreover, he led an exemplary life and deserves to be remembered with respect as a <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> whose <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> character was equal to his learning. Unlike some other <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, he showed no antagonism to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His works included grammatical treatises, translations from the Greek, and commentaries on the works of various classical authors. In addition to an elementary Latin grammar, he brought out a widely popular Latin version of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of Greek grammar by <a href="../cathen/09614a.htm">Chrysoloras</a>. His translations included the whole of Strabo and some fifteen of Plutarch's "Lives", besides some of the works of <a href="../cathen/09409a.htm">Lucian</a> and Isocrates. He commented on Persius, Juvenal, <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">Martial</a> and some others. He was an industrious discover and collector of Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, among them being <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the younger Pliny, Cicero, and <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>. At <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> he discovered a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Pliny's "Epistles" containing about 124 letters, and several copies of this were made before it was lost. He left behind him many speeches and some 600 letters.
