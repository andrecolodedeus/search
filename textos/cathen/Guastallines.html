<h1>Guastallines</h1>  

<p>Luigia Torelli, Countess of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a> (b. about 1500; d. 29 Oct., 1559 or 1569), <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> for the second time when she was twenty-five, resolved to devote her life to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Principality of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a>, which she had inherited from her father, was laid claim to by another branch of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the affair carried before <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, whereupon she settled the matter by disposing of her estates to Fernando Gonzaga, thereby also increasing her resources for the religious foundations she had in mind. In 1536 she entered the <a href="../cathen/01483a.htm">Angelicals</a>, a congregation which she had founded and richly endowed, taking the name in religion of Paola Maria; and later she established or assisted in the establishment of several other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in various parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. With other <a href="../cathen/01483a.htm">Angelicals</a> she accompanied the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> on their missions, working among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and converting numbers from lives of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. When <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> imposed the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01483a.htm">Angelicals</a>, whom their foundress had destined for works of active charity, particularly the care of the sick and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, she instituted another community, also at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, for whom she built a house between the Roman and the Tosa gate, known as the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a>. Like the <a href="../cathen/01483a.htm">Angelicals</a>, they were under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>. The members, known as Daughters of Mary, dedicated themselves to the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, eighteen being provided for in the endowment. The <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, appointed by prominent <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a>, who eventually became administrators of the institute, may remain for twelve years, after which they are free either to return to the world, or remain as religious, receiving in the former event a dowry of 2000 lire ($400). After the death of the foundress, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, at the instance of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, enclosed the community. The sisters live as religious, attend choir, have their meals in common, observe definite hours for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, silence, and work, but take no solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Their garb is black, fashioned according to a more secular style than was that of the <a href="../cathen/01483a.htm">Angelicals</a> and their veil is folded in a peculiar coronet form; each also wears a gold ring engraved with a hand holding a cross. Their charges dress in blue and are also popularly known as Guastallines.
