<h1>Guelphs and Ghibellines</h1>  

<p>Names adopted by the two factions that kept <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> divided and devastated by civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> during the greater part of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>It has been well observed by Grisar, in his recent biography of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of two powers to govern the world, one spiritual and the other temporal, each independent within its own limits, is as old as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself, and based upon the Divine command to "render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the things that are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>". The earlier <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, such as Gelasius I (494) and Symmachus (506), write emphatically on this theme, which received illustration in the <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> of the eighth century in a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of the Lateran palace that represented Christ delivering the keys to St. Silvester and the banner to the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>, and St. Peter giving the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> stole to <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> and the banner to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The latter scene insists on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> action in the restoration of the Western Empire, which <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> regards as an act of usurpation on the part of Leo. For <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor are as two suns to shed light upon man's spiritual and temporal paths respectively, Divinely <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of Him from Whom the power of Peter and of Caesar bifurcates as from a point. Thus, throughout the troubled period of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, men inevitably looked to the harmonious alliance of these two powers to renovate the face of the earth, or, when it seemed no longer possible for the two to work in unison, they appealed to one or the other to come forward as the saviour of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. We get the noblest form of these aspirations in the ideal imperialism of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "De Monarchia", on the one hand; and, on the other, in the conception of the ideal <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <em>papa angelico</em> of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard's</a> "De Consideratione" and the "Letters" of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>.

<p>This great conception can vaguely be discerned at the back of the nobler phases of the Guelph and Ghibelline contests; but it was soon obscured by considerations and conditions absolutely unideal and material. Two main factors may be said to have produced and kept alive these struggles: the antagonism between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire, each endeavouring to extend its authority into the field of the other; the mutual hostility between a territorial <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> nobility, of military <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a>, and of foreign descent, and a commercial and municipal democracy, clinging to the traditions of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, and ever increasing in wealth and power. Since the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (800), the relations of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> had been ill defined, full of the seeds of future contentions, which afterwards bore fruit in the prolonged "War of Investitures", begun by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> (1075), and brought to a close by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> and Henry V (1122). Neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor the Empire was able to make itself politically supreme in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Throughout the eleventh century, the free Italian communes had arisen, owing a nominal allegiance to the Empire as having succeeded to the power of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and as being the sole source of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and right, but looking for support, politically as well as spiritually, to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>.

<p>The names "Guelph" and "Ghibelline" appear to have originated in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in the rivalry between the house of Welf (Dukes of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>) and the house of Hohenstaufen (Dukes of Swabia), whose ancestral castle was Waiblingen in Franconia. Agnes, daughter of Henry IV and sister of Henry V, married Duke Frederick of Swabia. "Welf" and "Waiblingen" were first used as rallying cries at the battle of Weinsberg (1140), where Frederick's son, Emperor Conrad III (1138-1152), defeated Welf, the brother of the rebellious Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Henry the Proud. Conrad's nephew and successor, <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I "Barbarossa"</a> (1152-1190), attempted to reassert the imperial authority over the Italian cities, and to exercise supremacy over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> itself. He recognized an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Victor, in opposition to the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159), and destroyed <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1162), but was signally defeated by the forces of the Lombard League at the battle of Legnano (1176) and compelled to agree to the peace of Constance (1183), by which the liberties of the Italian communes were secured. The mutual jealousies of the Italian cities themselves, however, prevented the treaty from having permanent results for the independence and unity of the nation. After the death of Frederick's son and successor, Henry VI (1197), a struggle ensued in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> between the rival claimants for the Empire: Henry's brother, Philip of Swabia (d. 1208), and Otho of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. According to the more probable theory, it was then that the names of the factions were introduced into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. "Guelfo" and "Ghibellino" being the Italian forms of "Welf" and "Waiblingen". The princes of the house of Hohenstaufen being the constant opponents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, "Guelph" and "Ghibelline" were taken to denote adherents of Church and Empire, respectively. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> having favoured and fostered the growth of the communes, the Guelphs were in the main the republican, commercial, burgher party; the Ghibellines represented the old <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> aristocracy of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. For the most part the latter were descended from Teutonic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> planted in the peninsula by the Germanic invasions (of the past), and they naturally looked to the emperors as their protectors against the growing power and pretensions of the cities. It is, however, clear that these names were merely adopted to designate parties that, in one form or another, had existed from the end of the eleventh century.

<p>In the endeavour to realize the precise signification of these terms, one must consider the local politics and the special conditions of each individual state and town. Thus, in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> quarrel between the Buondelmonti and the Amidei, in 1215, led traditionally to the introduction of "Guelph" and "Ghibelline" to mark off the two parties that henceforth kept the city divided; but the factions themselves had virtually existed since the death of the great Countess Mathilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (1115), a hundred years before, had left the republic at liberty to work out its own destinies. The rivalry of city against city was also, in many cases, a more potent inducement for one to declare itself Guelph and another Ghibelline, than any specially <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or imperial proclivities on the part of its citizens. Pavia was Ghibelline, because <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was Guelph. Florence being the head of the Guelph league in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, Lucca was Guelph because it needed Florentine protection; <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> was Ghibelline, because it sought the support of the emperor against the Florentines and against the rebellious nobles of its own territory; <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> was Ghibelline, partly from hostility to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, partly from the hope of rivalling with imperial aid the maritime glories of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. In many cities a Guelph faction and a Ghibelline faction alternately got the upper hand, drove out its adversaries, destroyed their houses and confiscated their possessions. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which had aided <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> against <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a>, owed no allegiance to the Western empire, and naturally stood apart.



<p>One of the last acts of Frederick I had been to secure the marriage of his son Henry with Constance, aunt and heiress of William the Good, the last of the Norman kings of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The son of this marriage, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (b. 1194), thus inherited this South Italian kingdom, hitherto a bulwark against the imperial Germanic power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was defended in his possession of it against the Emperor Otho by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, to whose charge he had been left as a ward by his mother. On the death of Otho (1218), Frederick became emperor, and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1220). The danger, to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> alike, of the union of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (a vassal kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>) with the empire, was obvious; and Frederick, when elected King of the Romans, had sworn not to unite the southern kingdom with the German crown. His neglect of this pledge, together with the misunderstandings concerning his <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, speedily brought about a fresh conflict between the Empire and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The prolonged struggle carried on by the successors of Honorius, from <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, against the last Swabian princes, mingled with the worst excesses of the Italian factions on either side, is the central and most typical phase of the Guelph and Ghibelline story. From 1227, when first <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, to the end of his life, Frederick had to battle incessantly with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the second Lombard League, and the Guelph party in general throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet, conveying the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to a council summoned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> at the battle of Meloria (1241); and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory's</a> successor, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, was compelled to take refuge in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1245). The atrocious tyrant, Ezzelino da Romano, raised up a bloody despotism in <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and Padua; the Guelph nobles were temporarily expelled from Florence; but Frederick's favourite son, King Enzio of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, was defeated and captured by the Bolognese (1249), and the strenuous opposition of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> proved too much for the imperial power. After the death of Frederick (1250), it seemed as if his <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son, Manfred, King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1254-1266), himself practically an Italian, was about to unite all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> into a Ghibelline, anti-papal monarchy. Although in the north the Ghibelline supremacy was checked by the victory of the Marquis Azzo d'Este over Ezzelino at Cassano on the Adda (1259), in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> even Florence was lost to the Guelph cause by the sanguinary battle of Montaperti (4 Sept., 1260), celebrated in <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> poem. <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> then offered Manfred's crown to Charles of Anjou, the brother of St. Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Charles came to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and by the great victory of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> (26 Feb., 1266), at which Manfred was killed, established a French dynasty upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The defeat of Frederick's grandson, Conradin, at the battle of Tagliacozzo (1268) followed by his judicial <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by the command of Charles, marks the end of the struggle and the overthrow of the German imperial power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for two and a half centuries.

<p>Thus the struggle ended in the complete triumph of the Guelphs. Florence, once more free and democratic, had established a special organization within the republic, known as the Parte Guelfa, to maintain Guelph principles and chastise supposed Ghibellines. <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, hitherto the stronghold of Ghibellinism in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, became Guelph after the battle of Colle di Valdelsa (1269). The pontificate of the saintly and pacific <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1271-1276) tended to dissociate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the Guelph party, which now began to look more to the royal house of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Although they lost <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by the "Vespers of Palermo" (1282), the Angevin kings of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> remained the chief power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the natural leaders of the Guelphs, with whose aid they had won their crown. Adherence to Ghibelline principles was still maintained by the republics of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and Arezzo, the Della Scala <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and a few petty despots here and there in Romagna and elsewhere. No great ideals of any kind were by this time at stake. As <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> declares in the "Paradiso" (canto vi), one party opposed to the imperial eagle the golden lilies, and the other appropriated the eagle to a faction, "so that it is hard to see which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a> most". The intervention of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in the politics of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, when the predominant Guelphs of Florence split into two new factions, was the cause of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> exile (1301), and drove him for a while into the ranks of the Ghibellines. The next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> (1303-1304), made earnest attempts to reconcile all parties; but the "Babylonian Captivity" of his successors at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> augmented the divisions of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. From the death of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1250) to the election of Henry VII (1308), the imperial throne was regarded by the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> as vacant. Henry himself was a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> and high minded idealist, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the very names of Guelph and Ghibelline; his expedition to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1310-1313) roused much temporary enthusiasm (reflected in the poetry of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and Cino da Pistoia), but he was successfully resisted by King Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and the Florentines. After his death, imperial vicars made themselves masters of various cities. Uguccione della Faggiuola (d. 1320), for a brief while lord of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> "in marvellous glory", defeated the allied forces of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and Florence at the battle of Montecatini (29 Aug., 1315), a famous Guelph overthrow that has left its traces in the popular poetry of the fourteenth century. Can Grande della Scala (d. 1339), <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> friend and patron, upheld the Ghibelline cause with magnanimity in eastern <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>; while Matteo Visconti (d. 1322) established a permanent dynasty in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, which became a sort of Ghibelline counterbalance to the power of the Angevin Neapolitans in the south. Castruccio Interminelli (d. 1328), a soldier of fortune who became Duke of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, attempted the like in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; but his signory perished with him. Something of the old Guelph and Ghibelline spirit revived during the struggle between Ludwig of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>; Ludwig set up an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by a representative of the Roman people, but his conduct disgusted his own partisans. In the poetry of Fazio degli Uberti (d. after 1368), a new Ghibellinism makes itself heard: <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> declares that <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> can only enjoy peace when united beneath the scepter of one Italian king.

<p>Before the return of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, "Guelph" and "Ghibelline" had lost all real significance. Men called themselves Guelph or Ghibelline, and even fought furiously under those names, simply because their forbears had adhered to one or other of the factions. In a city which had been officially Guelph in the past, any minority opposed to the government of the day, or obnoxious to the party in power, would be branded as "Ghibelline". Thus, in 1364, we find it enacted by the Republic of Florence that any one who appeals to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> or the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> shall be declared a Ghibelline. "There are no more wicked nor more mad folk under the vault of heaven than the Guelphs and Ghibellines", says St. Bernardino of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> in 1427. He gives an appalling picture of the atrocities still perpetuated, even by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, under these names, albeit by that time the primitive signification of the terms had been lost, and declares that the mere professing to belong to either party is in itself a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. As party catch-words they survived, still attended with bloody consequences, until the coming to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1529) finally re-established the imperial power, and opened a new epoch in the relations of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor.
