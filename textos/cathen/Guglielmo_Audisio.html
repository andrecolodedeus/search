<h1>Guglielmo Audisio</h1>  

<p>Born at Bra, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1801; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 27 September, 1882. He was professor of sacred eloquence in the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Bra, appointed presiding officer of the Academy of Superga (Turin) by King Charles Albert, but was expelled from this office because he was opposed to the irreligious politics of the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> Government. He then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed him professor of natural and popular <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the Roman University, and Canon of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>.

<p>Audisio was a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and charitable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and spent large sums in benevolent works. He was an excellent teacher of sacred eloquence, and his manual on the subject was translated into many languages and frequently quoted approvingly. He also devoted himself to historical studies, especially in illustration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, bringing to them absolutely good intentions, assiduous industry, and much just and acute observation, such as was not then common in the circle which surrounded him. Nevertheless these historical labours had no great intrinsic value, especially at a time when so large a number of documents were being published. For this reason they are no longer sought after by students.

<p>Audisio had no deep insight into <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and law, and often displayed deplorable lapses on these subjects in his writings and his lectures. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he was accused of Gallicanism, to the great grief of his patron <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, and his work on political and religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in the nineteenth century was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Audisio, however, was profoundly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in feeling, and, not only did he fully submit to the condemnation of his book, but he warmly protested against the accusation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> and disobedience. He was a fervent upholder of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against the political <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">liberalism</a> of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. He was one of the founders of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>intransigent</em> paper, the "Armonia" of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. It was for this reason that he fell a victim to the anti-clerical influence which had deprived him of his post at Superga.

<p>But in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Audisio united himself with that clique of liberal <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (such as Monsignor Liverani) who advocated reforms and concessions not always just and often premature, and who professed doctrines of little weight, sometimes <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, often inexact. In this environment Audisio compromised himself, but his figure remains that of an extremely religious and charitable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and of an eager student devoted to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Some pages of his works on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> still merit consultation.

<p>The works of Audisio are: "Lezioni di Eloquenza Sacra" (several editions); "Juris Naturae et Gentium Publici Fundamenta" (Rome 1852); "Idea storica della diplomazia ecclesiastica (Rome, 1864); "Storia religiosa e civile dei papi" (5 vols., Rome, 1860); "Sistema politica e religiosa di Federico II e di Pietro della Vigna" (1866); "Della societ&agrave; politica e religiosa rispetto al secolo XIX" (Florence, 1876, condemned by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office, April 1877; "Vita di Pio IX."
