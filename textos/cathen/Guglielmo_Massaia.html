<h1>Guglielmo Massaia</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, born 9 June, 1809, at Piova in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, 6 August, 1889. His <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> was Lorenzo; that of Guglielmo was given him when he became a religious. He was first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Collegio Reale at <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a> under the care of his elder brother Guglielmo, a canon and <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of that city. On the death of his brother he passed as a student to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; but at the age of sixteen entered the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Franciscan Order</a>, receiving the habit on 25 September, 1825. Immediately after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; but even whilst teaching he acquired some fame as a preacher and was chosen confessor to Prince Victor Emmanuel, afterwards King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Ferdinand, Duke of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. The royal family of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> would have nominated him on several occasions to an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, but he strenuously opposed their project, being desirous of joining the foreign missions of his order. He obtained his wish in 1846. That year the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, at the instance of the traveller <a href="../cathen/01006e.htm">Antoine d'Abbadie</a>, determined to establish a Vicariate-Apostolic for the Gallas in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>. The mission was confided to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and Massaia was appointed first vicar-apostolic, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 24 May of that year. On his arrival in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> he found the country in a state of religious agitation. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Cyril, was dead and there was a movement amongst the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> towards union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Massaia, who had received plenary faculties from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a number of native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the Coptic Rite; he also obtained the appointment by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> of a vicar-apostolic for the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and himself <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the missionary Giustino de Jacobis to this office. But this act aroused the enmity of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who sent a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his own, Abba Salama, to <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. As a result of the ensuing political agitation, Massaia was banished from the country and had to flee under an assumed name. In 1850 he visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to gain a fresh band of missionaries and means to develop his work: he had interviews with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and with Lord Palmerston in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. On his return to the Gallas he founded a large number of missions; he also established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of Galla boys whom he had freed from slavery; besides this he composed a grammar of the Galla language which was published at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1867. During his thirty-five years as a missionary he was exiled seven times, but he always returned to his labours with renewed vigour. However, in 1880 he was compelled by ill-health to resign his mission. In recognition of his merit, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> raised him to the titular Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/14283b.htm">Stauropolis</a>, and on 10 November, 1884, to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the title of S. Vitalis. At the command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he wrote an account of his missionary labours, under the title, "I miei trentacinque anni di missione nell' alta Etiopia", the first volume of which was published simultaneously at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1883, and the last in 1895. In this work he deals not only with the progress of the mission, but with the political and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them.
