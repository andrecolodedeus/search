<h1>Gugliemo Sirleto</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and scholar, born at Guardavalle near Stilo in Calabria, 1514; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 October, 1585. The son of a physician, he received an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, made the acquaintance of distinguished scholars at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and became an intimate friend of Cardinal Marcello Cervino, later Pope Marcellus II. He prepared for <a href="../cathen/09641a.htm">Cervino</a>, who was President of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in its initial period, extensive reports on all the important questions presented for discussion. After his appointment as custodian of the Vatican Library, Sirleto drew up a complete descriptive catalogue of its Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and prepared a new edition of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> named him prothonotary and tutor to two of his nephews. After this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> death he taught Greek and Hebrew at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, numbering St. Charles Barromeo among his students. During the concluding period of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, he was, although he continued to reside at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Constant and most heeded adviser of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>-legates. He was himself created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1565, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Marco in Calabria in 1566, and of <a href="../cathen/14239a.htm">Squillace</a> in 1568. An order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary of state, however, enjoined his residence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was named, in 1570, librarian of the Vatican Library. His influence was paramount in the execution of the scientific undertakings decreed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He collaborated in the publication of the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a>, presided over the Commissions for the reform of <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, and directed the work of the new edition of the Roman Martyrology. Highly appreciative of Greek culture, he entertained all friendly relations with the East and encouraged all efforts tending to <a href="../cathen/15132a.htm">ecclesiastical reunion</a>. He was attended in his last illness by <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> and was buried in the presence of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>.
