<h1>Guibert of Ravenna</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, known as Clement III, 1080 (1084) to 1100; born at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> about 1025; died at Civit&agrave; Castellana, 8 Sept., 1100. This adversary of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> and of his reform policies came from a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, which was related to the Margraves of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>. We first find him in history as a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> and imperial chancellor for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This office he received in the year 1057 from the Empress Agnes. He retained it until 1063. Guibert took part in the synod which was held by the newly elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1058-1061), at Sutri in January, 1059. But on the latter's death he contrived through his influence with the anti-reform party of the Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and at the imperial court to bring about the election of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalous of Parma (Honorius II)</a>, and became an opponent of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>. Owing to the active support of Duke Godfrey of Lorraine, of Archbishop Anno of Cologne, and especially of <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was soon recognized even in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and by the Empress Agnes. Perhaps this was the reason of Guibert's dismissal in 1063 from the chancellorship. The following nine years give us no trace of him. He must have continued, however, in friendly relations with the German Court, and retained the favour of the Empress Agnes, for when, in the year 1072, the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, on the recommendation of the empress, named him to this important <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>. <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a> hesitated to confirm this choice, but was prevailed upon by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Cardinal Hildebrand</a> to sanction it. Guibert thereupon took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the Holy Father and to his successors, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (1073).

<p><a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, who assumed his holy office on 29 April, 1073, under the name of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. Guibert participated in the first <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> synod of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which was held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (March, 1074), and at which important <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and the incontinence of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. But it was not long before he joined the party in opposition to the great pontiff, with whom he had quarrelled about the city of <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a>. The accusation was made against him that he had entered into an alliance with Cencius and Cardinal Hugo Candidus, the antagonists of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He absented himself from the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Synod of 1075, although he was bound by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to obey the summons to attend it. By his absence he made manifest his opposition to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, who now suspended him for his refusal to attend the synod. It was in this same year that <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> began his open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. At the synod of the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Worms (January, 1076), a resolution was adopted deposing <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, and in this decision the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> joined. Among these must have been Guibert, for he shared in the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdiction</a> which <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> pronounced against the guilty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Synod of 1076.

<p>In April of the same year a synod was held at Pavia by a number of Lombard <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, presided over by Guibert. As these did not hesitate to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> found himself compelled to resort to still stronger measures with regard to Guibert. At the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Synod of February, 1078, he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Guibert by name, and with him Archbishop Tebaldo of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. In March, 1080, he renewed his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against Henry IV, and gave his recognition to Rudolph of Swabia as ruler of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, whereupon Henry summoned such partisans as he had among the German and Lombard <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to a meeting at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> (June, 1080). This meeting drew up a new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> purporting to depose the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, which Henry himself also signed, and then proceeded to elect the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Henry at once recognized him as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, swearing that he would lead him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and there receive from his hands the imperial crown. Guibert put on <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> garments and proceeded with great pomp to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Synod of 1081 <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> reiterated against Henry and his followers his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> failed to secure recognition outside of Henry's dominions; he was in fact but a tool in the hands of the latter, and quite devoid of personal initiative. On 21 March, 1084, Henry IV succeeded after many fruitless attempts in gaining possession of the greater part of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> found himself besieged in the Castle of Sant' Angelo, while, on 24 March, Guibert was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Lateran as Clement III. On 31 March Guibert <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry IV emperor at St. Peter's. However, when the news was brought that <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> was hastening to the aid of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, Henry with his <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take up the fight in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> against the troops of the Margravine Matilda. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, escorted by <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, repaired to <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, where he renewed his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Henry and Guibert. This was at the close of the year 1084.

<p>The German episcopate stood divided. While <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> loyal to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> held a synod in Quedlinburg, at which they denounced and condemned the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, those who supported Henry approved at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> the deposition of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and the elevation of Guibert (1085). This conflict continued even after the death of the great <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> (25 May, 1085), during the entire reigns of whose successors, <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a>, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, and Paschal II, Guibert figured as the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> of Henry and his party. <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a>, who was elected after a prolonged vacancy caused by the critical position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was compelled, eight days after his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> in St. Peter's (3 May, 1087), to fly from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the partisans of Guibert. The latter were in turn assailed by the troops of Countess Matilda, and entrenched themselves in the Pantheon. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088-1099), was at one time master of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but he was afterwards driven from the city by the adherents of Guibert, and sought refuge in Lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In June, 1089, at a pseudo-synod held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> declared invalid the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> launched against Henry, and various charges were made against the supporters of the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Still, the years which followed brought to <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> ever-increasing prestige, while Henry IV's power and influence were more and more on the wane. The greater part of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was captured by an army of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> under Count Hugh of Vermandois, brother of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The party of Guibert retained only the castle of Sant' Angelo, and even this in 1098 fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> champion. Guibert's influence, after Henry IV's withdrawal from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was virtually confined to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and a few other districts of Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He repaired to <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> after the accession of Paschal II (1099-1118), hoping again to become master of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but he was compelled to withdraw. He reached Civit&agrave; Castellana, where he died on 8 September, 1100. His followers, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, elected another <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Bishop Theodorus of S. Rufina, who, however, never held any real power. (Compare also the articles GREGORY VII; VICTOR III; <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">URBAN II</a>; and PASCHAL II.)
