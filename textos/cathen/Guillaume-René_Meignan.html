<h1>Guillaume-Ren&eacute; Meignan</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, French <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> and Scriptural <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, b. at Chauvign&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 12 April, 1817; d. at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, 20 January 1896. Having ascertained his vocation to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, on the completion of his academic studies at the Angers <em>lyc&eacute;e</em> and at Ch&acirc;teau-Gontier, he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, where he received the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> in 1839. From this institution he passed to the Coll&egrave;ge de Tess&eacute;, which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Diocese of Le Mans</a>, where, while teaching in one of the middle grades, he continued his own <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies. All through his career he seems to have been blessed with the friendship and sympathetic counsel of the most eminent men among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his time and country. The Abb&eacute; Bercy, an <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> of some distinction, whose notice he attracted at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> and later at Tess&eacute;, advised him to make scriptural exegis his special study. <a href="../cathen/02723c.htm">Mgr Bouvier</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (14 June, 1840) and sent him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for a further course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> under Victor Cousin. Meignan made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/11378a.htm">Ozanam</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and others like them, who urged him to prepare for the special controversial needs of the day by continuing his studies in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Following this advice, he became the pupil at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> of such teachers as <a href="../cathen/06652a.htm">G&ouml;rres</a>, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, and Windschmann; and when his earlier attraction for Scriptural studies was thoroughly reawakened under the stimulus of the then fresh T&uuml;bingen discussions, he repaired to Berlin where he attended the lectures of Neander, Hengstenberg, and Schelling. In, or soon after May, 1843, Meignan returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to be numbered among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the archdiocese, but was soon (1845) <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the good of his health, which had become impaired. He seemed to recover immediately, and was able to prosecute his sacred studies so successfully that he won a Doctorate of Theology at the Sapienza (March, 1846). Here again he was helped by the friendly interest and advice of many eminent men, of <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> and <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, as well as by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11518b.htm">Passaglia</a>, Patrizzi, and <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a>. Between this period and 1861, when he became professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, he filled various academical positions in the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Archdiocese of Paris</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Mgr Darboy</a> made him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1863. In 1864 he was elevated to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, in 1882 transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">See of Arras</a>, and in 1884 to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>.

<p>By the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of circumstances he was one of the chief antagonists of Ernest Renan. In his work he aimed to enlighten the lay mind on current topics of controversy and, while giving a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the assured results of criticism, to supply his readers with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> point of view. His aggressive and triumphant career as an <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> began as early as 1856 with the publication of "Les proph&eacute;ties messianiques. Le Pentateuque" (Paris). In 1860 appeared "M. Renan r&eacute;fut&eacute; par les rationalistes allemands" (Paris) and "Les Evangiles et la critique au XIXe si&egrave;cle" (Paris); in 1886 "De l'irr&eacute;ligion syst&eacute;matique, ses influences actuelles" (Paris); in 1890 "Salomon, son r&egrave;gne, ses &eacute;crits" (Paris); in 1892 "Les proph&egrave;tes d'Isra&euml;l et le Messie, depuis Daniel jusqu'&agrave; Jean-Baptiste" (Paris). He wrote many other works on kindred topics. His treatment of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> prophecy extends far beyond mere verbal exegis, and includes a critical examination of historical events and conditions. Like other great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists of his time, he had to suffer adverse criticism; these criticisms were finally answered by the action of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who raised him to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, 15 Dec., 1892.
