<h1>Guillaume Dubois</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and statesman, born at Brive, in Limousin, 1656; died at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 1723. He was the son of an honourable physician and received his first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the Fathers of the Christian Doctrine in his native place, whence he went in 1672, as beneficiary, to the Coll&egrave;ge Saint-Michel in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He had been engaged some nine years in private teaching when he was appointed (1683) sub-preceptor to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, nephew of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, the full tutorship following four years later. When the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> became Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (1700), Dubois was made his secretary. During the regency of Philippe d'Orl&eacute;ans he rose in rapid succession to the high positions of state councillor (1716), secretary of foreign affairs (1717), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (1720), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <em>surintendant des postes</em> (1721), member of the <em>Conseil de r&eacute;gence,</em> and soon after, <em>ministre principal</em> (1722). The <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> admitted him the same year and the Assembly of the French Clergy elected him president in 1723, the year of his death.

<p>Owing to his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> birth, his stanch opposition to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and his bold reversal of the aristocratic regime prevalent under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, Dubois was disliked by the noblemen of his day. On the authority of contemporary <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libels</a> and Saint-Simon's memoirs, historians of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> have long repeated against him such charges as corrupting the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of his pupil, accepting money from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, seeking, though unworthy, <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>, etc. The publication by S&eacute;velinges of Dubois's memoirs and correspondence together with the careful study of contemporary documents by Seilhac, Wiesener, and Bliard &mdash; e.g. the diplomatic papers preserved in the archives of the French, English, and Spanish foreign offices &mdash; have thrown a new light on the subject and partly verified the words of Fontenelle at the time of the reception of Cardinal Dubois into the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>: "Les si&egrave;cles suivants en sauront davantage; fiez-vous &agrave; eux". Far from catering to his pupil's wantonness, Dubois did what he could to check it, and his <em>Plan d'&eacute;ducation pour le duc de Chartres</em> shows a competent and conscientious tutor. The expediency of his foreign policy, resulting in the Triple Alliance of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, like the contrary policy of Cardinal de Bernis, must be largely a matter of opinion. In so far as Dubois was concerned, it was the best way of serving the interests of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and counteracting the intrigues of Alberoni. Stair and Stanhope had a high regard, almost amounting to friendship, for the minister of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but on both sides the charge that bribery was resorted to is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. That Dubois was not set against the natural amity between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was shown later, when, after Alberoni's fall and the restoration of peace, he successfully negotiated the treaty of 1721 and the marriage of Louis XV with the <em>Infanta</em> and that of the Prince of the Asturias with Mlle de Montpensier. Dubois's career as a churchman is not above reproach. While there is no foundation for the oft-repeated assertion of his <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">secret marriage</a>, his gross licentiousness, and <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> impiety even at the hour of his death, still it cannot be denied that he sought and used <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> principally as props to his political prestige. <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">Tonsured</a> at the age of thirteen he bethought himself of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred Orders</a> only in his old age, when, the better to secure the long coveted and long denied red hat, he asked for the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> merely as a stepping stone to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>.

<p>The "M&eacute;moires du cardinal Dubois" published by P. Lacroix* (Paris, 1829) are <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. His genuine writings were edited by S&eacute;velinges: "M&eacute;moires secrets et correspondance in&eacute;dite du cardinal Dubois" (Paris, 1815).
