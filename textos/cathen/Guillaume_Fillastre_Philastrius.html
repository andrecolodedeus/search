<h1>Guillaume Fillastre (Philastrius)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, canonist, <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, and geographer, b. 1348 at La Suze, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 November, 1428. After graduating as <em>doctor juris utriusque,</em> Fillastre taught <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and in 1392 was appointed <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter. During the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> he showed at first much sympathy for <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (Peter de Luna). In 1409, however, he took part in the attempt to reconcile the factions at the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>. <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> conferred on him and his friend d'Ailly the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1411), and in 1413 he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>. Fillastre took a very important part in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, where he and Cardinal d'Ailly were the first to agitate the question of the abdication of the rival claimants (February, 1415). He won special distinction through the many legal questions on which he gave decisions. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, in whose election he had been an important factor, appointed him <em>legatus a latere</em> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1418), where he was to promote the cause of Church unity. In recognition of his successful efforts in this capacity, he was made Archpriest of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>. In 1421 he resigned the See of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, and in 1422 was assigned to the See of Saint-Pons-de-Thomi&#232;res. He died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in his eightieth year, as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of San Marco.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> Fillastre kept a diary discovered by Heinrich Finke, first reviewed by him in the "R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift" (1887), and there partly edited by him. It is the most important historical source for the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and was edited by Finke in its entirety in 1889 (in his "Forschungen und Quellen", see below, 163-242). Fillastre's notes throw new light on the principal participants in the council, as well as on the two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who were deposed and their trial, on the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a> as a body, and in particular on Cardinals d'Ailly, Fillastre, <a href="../cathen/15739a.htm">Zabarella</a>, etc. Fillastre is our only authority concerning the preliminary motions on the method of voting and the extremely difficult position of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">college of Cardinals</a>; he gives us our first clear conception of the quarrels that arose among the "nations" over the matter of precedence, and the place which the Spanish "nation" held at the council; he also furnishes the long-sought explanation of the confirmation of Sigismund as Holy Roman Emperor by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. Fillastre's diary derives its highest value, however, from the exposition of the relations between the king and the council and the description of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>.

<p>While Fillastre was in <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> (where, it may be remarked, he translated several of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> works into Latin), he rendered important services to the history of geography and cartography, as well as to the history of the council. Thus he had copied the Latin translation of Ptolemy's geography (without maps), which had been completed by Jacobus Angelus in 1409, a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> he had great difficulty in securing from Florence. Together with this precious Ptolemy codex, he sent in 1418 to the chapter-library of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, which he had founded and already endowed with many valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, a large map of the world traced on walrus skin, and a codex of Pomponius Mela. The two geographical <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> are still preserved as precious "cimelia" in the municipal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, but the map of the world unfortunately disappeared during the eighteenth century.

<p>About 1425 Fillastre wrote one of his most important canonical works on interest and <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>; it has been handed down in numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In 1427, though now an old man, he was as indefatigable as ever, and had the maps of Ptolemy drawn from a Greek original, but on a diminished scale, and arranged with Latin terminology, to go with his Latin Ptolemy. Since Ptolemy had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Scandinavian Peninsula, much less of <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a>, Fillastre completed his codex by adding to Ptolemy's ten maps of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> an eleventh. This "eleventh map of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>", with the subjoined detailed description of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and Greenland, is the only existing copy of the "first map" of Claudius Clavus, "the first cartographer of America". This precious cartographic treasure is still preserved in the municipal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>.
