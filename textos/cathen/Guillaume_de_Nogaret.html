<h1>Guillaume de Nogaret</h1>  

<p>Born about the middle of the thirteenth century at St. Felix-en-Lauragais; died 1314; he was one of the chief counsellors of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1285-1314), said to be descended from an <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and was a <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> of the lawyer, Pierre Flotte. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, winning a doctorate and a professorship, and was appointed, in 1294, royal judge of the seneschal's court of Beaucaire. In 1299 the title of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> was conferred on him by <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>. Imbued, from his study of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the absolute supremacy of the king, no scruple restrained Nogaret when the royal power was in question, and his influence was apparent in the struggle between Philip and <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. in 1300 Philip sent him as ambassador to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to excuse his alliance with Albert of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, usurper of the Empire. Nogaret, according to his own account, remonstrated with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who replied in vigorous language. After the death of Pierre Flotte at the battle of Courtrai (1302), Nogaret became chief adviser and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> genius of the king. On the publication of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unam Sanctam", he was charged with directing the conflict against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (February, 1303). At the Assembly of the Louvre (12 March, 1303), he bitterly attacked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and later, allying himself with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> Italian enemies (the Florentine banker, Musciatto de Franzesi, and Sciarra Colonna, the head of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party), he surprised <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> in his palace at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> and arrested him after subjecting him to outrageous treatment (7 September). But the inhabitants rescued the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose death (11 October), saved Nogaret from severe retribution. Early in 1304, at Languedoc, he explained his actions to the king, and received considerable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as recompense. Philip even sent him with an embassy to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, who refused to absolve him from the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> he had incurred. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, however, absolved him in 1311.

<p>Nogaret played a decisive part in the trial of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars.</a> On 22 September, 1307, at Maubuisson, Philip made him keeper of the seal and the same day the Royal Council issued a warrant for the arrest of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, which was executed on 12 October; Nogaret himself arrested the Knights of the Temple in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and drew up the proclamation justifying the crime. It was he who directed all the measures that ended in the execution of Jacques de Molai and the principal <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> (1314). The same year Nogaret, who displayed untiring energy in drawing up the documents by which he sought to ruin his adversaries, undertook to justify the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> by announcing the plans for a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, the expenses of which were to be defrayed by the confiscated goods of the Order. In this Latin document, addressed to <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, the author attributes the failure of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> and declares that <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> alone could direct them successfully, provided that he obtained the help of all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes to secure the funds required for the expedition; all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> should be given to the king, likewise all legacies left for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> and all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> should be taxed. The other <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, the churches should retain only the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their support, the surplus should be given for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. No one took this document seriously, it was probably intended as a solemn hoax. Nogaret's influence may be seen in the trial for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a> against Guichard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> (1308). A <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> but unscrupulous royal partisan, a fierce and bitter enemy, Nogaret died before <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, at the time when the regime he had devoted himself to establishing was beginning to be attacked on all sides.
