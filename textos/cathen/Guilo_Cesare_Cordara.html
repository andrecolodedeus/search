<h1>Guilo Cesare Cordara</h1>  

<p>Historian and <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em>, b. at Alessandra in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 14 Dec., 1704; died there 6 March, 1785. The scion of an illustrious and ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> that came originally from <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, young Cordara studied at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and became a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> himself at the age of fourteen. Subsequently he taught in various colleges of the order, soon acquiring a great reputation not only for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of general literature, but especially for proficiency in poetry, rhetoric, and history. A brilliant discourse on <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, the founder of the Roman College, and a satire on the Cabalists of the day, won for him admission into the Academy of the Arcadians. Several poetical works of his appeared under the pen name of Pameno Cassio. He was in high favor with the exiled Stuarts, then residing in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on account of an allegorical drama, "La Morte di Nice", which he composed in honor of the titular King James III, and a history in Latin of the expedition into <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> of Charles Edward Stuart, Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, which some of his admirers look upon as his most finished production. His satires on "The Literary Spirit of the Times", published in 1737, are of a high order of merit. In them he pillories a class of contemporary writers who arrogated to themselves the literary censorship of their day, condemned the classification of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and the methods of instruction then in vogue, and even the accepted principles of taste. A seventh and revised edition was brought out at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1764. But the work by which he is perhaps best known is "The History of the Society of Jesus", Sixth Part, in two volumes, the first published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1750, the second posthumously, by Father Raggazzini in 1859, over a century later. This work was a continuation of the history of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> by <a href="../cathen/11317a.htm">Orlandini</a>, Saccini, and Juvency, and embraced the period of <a href="../cathen/15486d.htm">Mutius Vitelleschi</a>, 1616-1633. It is in Latin and remarkable for the elegance, purity, and dignity of its style. He is also the author of a history of the German College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which contains a list of its distinguished <em>alumni</em> (Rome, 1770). When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a>, Cordara, who had been a member for more than half a century, withdrew from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and later to <a href="../cathen/01283d.htm">Alessandria</a>, where the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> had allowed some members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to live unmolested. Notwithstanding his advanced age and his new mode of life, Cordara continued his literary labours and published much in prose and verse. Sommervogel enumerates more than sixty works, large and small, of which he is the author. The citizens of his native town erected a marble <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> to his memory, in the church of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>.
