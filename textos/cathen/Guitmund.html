<h1>Guitmund</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and opponent of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>; born at an unknown place in Normandy during the first quarter of the eleventh century; died between 1090-95, at <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In his youth he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La-Croix-St-Leufroy in the <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Diocese of Evreux</a>, and about 1060 he was studying <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02379b.htm">Bec</a>, where he had <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> as teacher and <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a> as fellow-student. In 1070 King William the Conqueror called him to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and, as an inducement to remain there, offered him a diocese. The <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, however, not only refused the offer, but fearlessly denounced the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the Normans as an act of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> ("Oratio ad Guillelmum I" in P.L., CXLIX, 1509). He then returned to Normandy and became a stanch defender of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a>. Some time between 1073-77 he wrote, at the instance of one of his fellow-monks by the name of Roger, his famous treatise on the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, entitled "De corporis et sanguinis Jesu Christi veritate in Eucharistia". It is written in the form of a dialogue between himself and Roger and contains an exposition as well as a refutation of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Guitmund ably defends <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> against <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, but his notion of the manner of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> is obscure. Moreover, he does not well distinguish between <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, and hence concludes that the corruptibility of the species is merely a deception of our senses. The work has often appeared in print. The first printed edition was brought out by <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> (Freiburg, 1530). Shortly after Guitmund had published his treatise against <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, he obtained permission from his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Odilo, to make a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Because the name Guitmund had become too well known to suit the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he exchanged it for that of <em>Christianus</em> and lived for some time in the obscurity of a Roman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. When <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, who had previously been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Cluny, became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he appointed Guitmund <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, in 1088. A few historians hold that he afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but there seems not to be sufficient evidence for this assumption. Besides the work mentioned above, Guitmund is the author of a short treatise on the Trinity and of an epistle to a certain Erfastus, which deals with the same subject. His works are published in "Bibl. Patr. Lugd.", XVIII, 440 sqq.; in <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, "Bibl. veterum Patr.", XIV, 240 sqq., and <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "P.L.", CXLIX, 1427-1513.
