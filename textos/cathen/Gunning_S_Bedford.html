<h1>Gunning S. Bedford</h1>  

<p>Medical writer and teacher, b. at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in 1806; d. in New York, 5 September, 1870. He was a nephew and namesake of Gunning Bedford, first Attorney-General of <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a> and one of the framers of the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, who was aide-de-camp to General Washington and was appointed by him U.S. Judge for the District of Delaware. Dr. Bedford graduated in 1825 at <a href="../cathen/10605a.htm">Mount St. Mary's College</a>, Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and took his degree in <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> from Rutgers College, New York. He spent two years in foreign study and in 1833, when only twenty-six years of age, became professor of obstetrics in Charleston Medical College. From here he accepted a professorship in the Albany Medical College. He went to New York in 1836 and four years later founded the University Medical College, which became a great success. In connection with it he established an obstetrical clinic for those too <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> to pay a doctor's fee. This was the first of its kind in the country and was of great service to the poor and to medical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Dr. Bedford continued to teach until his health broke down in 1862 and he died in 1870. His funeral panegyric was preached by <a href="../cathen/09488a.htm">Archbishop McCloskey</a> who had been his fellow student at <a href="../cathen/10605a.htm">Mount St. Mary's</a>. Two books written by him, "Diseases of Women" and "Practice of Obstetrics" went through many editions, were translated into French and German, and were adopted as textbooks in American <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
