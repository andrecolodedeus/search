<h1>Gustave Xavier Lacroix de Ravignan</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, orator, and author, b. at <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> (Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es), 1 Dec. 1795; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 Feb., 1858. Sent quite young to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he studied in private boarding-schools, and for some time attended lectures at the Lyc&eacute;e Bonaparte. He first thought of entering the diplomatic service but decided in 1813 for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. On <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> return from <a href="../cathen/05371c.htm">Elba</a>, de Ravignon joined the Duc d'Angoul&ecirc;me's Royal Volunteers and made the unsuccessful Spanish campaign, distinguishing himself under fire at H&eacute;lette. He soon resigned his commission of lieutenant of cavalry and resumed his law studies. Called to the bar he was elected in 1817 a king's counsel in the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> circuit and in 1821 deputy attorney general. He was becoming famous when in May, 1822, he entered the Sulpician <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Issy. This made a sensation, heightened on 2 November, when he was received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Montrouge. Here he laid the foundation of that lofty but practical spirituality, master of self, generosity, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which ever marked him. After his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a>, he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 25 July, 1828. Like <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>, de Ravignan prepared for the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> in a professor's chair. For two years at St. Achuel near <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, for three more at Brieg, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. While at Brieg and at Estavayer on the Lake of Neufch&acirc;tel, he gave missions and retreats in the neighbouring country. His stirring <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> (1835), his success at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in St. Thomas d'Aquin (1836), pointed him to Mgr de Qu&eacute;len as the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> successor of Lacordiare at Notre Dame.

<p>On the Notre Dame conferences de Ravignan's oratorical fame mainly rests ["Conf&eacute;rences du R, P. de Ravignan de la Compagnie de J&eacute;sus" (Paris, 1860, 4 vols., 5th ed., Paris, 1897); "Conferences of Revd. Fr.de Ravignan" (Lent of 1846), tr. Fetherston (London, 1847), cf. also, "The Catholic Pulpit" (London, 1849)]. The subjects treated were the endless conflict of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, man, the Divinity, Person, and Doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. Here the orator introduced a course of moral conferences, but returned to <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> in a study of the relations between reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Reading these conferences now we find little colour, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, or dramatic movement; we miss the compelling magnetism of the speaker. De Ravignon was "Virtue preaching Truth". His <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, the sincere authority of his affirmation, his unction, his power in repose, his noble presence, his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> captivated, dominated his hearers. The men's retreats begun by him, and in which he excelled, completed the work. Superior of his brethren at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> (1837-42), at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1848-51), then, as afterwards, he was preaching in almost every important city in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was heard also in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1851) where he assisted <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> at his first Mass. Everywhere he was winning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>In 1843-45, public opinion led by Th&iacute;ers, Cousin, Michelet, Libri, Quintet, B&eacute;ranger, had set against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Some said they were working for Bourbons, others that they were too loyal to the House of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a>, Vatimesnil, <a href="../cathen/02539b.htm">Beugnot</a>, Barthel&eacute;my defended them. De Ravignon, the foremost <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was accused of having left the order; at another time, of having made unworthy concessions to the Government. He easily cleared himself with his superior-general, <a href="../cathen/13182a.htm">Fr. Roothaan</a>, and vindicated his order, its asceticisms, its constitutions, its doctrines, its works, in a calm, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, but serenely eloquent book, "De l'Existence et de l'Institut des J&eacute;suites" (Paris, 1844; 9th ed., Paris, 1879); tr. Seager (London, 1844) and Atchison (London, 1844). The book created a sensation, Boyer-Collard enthusiastically praising it. Twenty-five thousand copies were sold in one year, but the fight continued. Through its agent, Pelligrino Rossi, the Government of Louis-Phillipe asked <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> to secularize the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> replied that to do so would be a violation of the concordant and the constitution, that no crime was imputed to the order, that the French episcopate spoke well of it. He refused, although the Government and its agent tried to create a contrary impression. De Ravignon advised a firm constitutional resistance, but <a href="../cathen/13182a.htm">Fr. Roothaan</a>, to spare further embarrassment to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, without commanding, suggested that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> might temporarily and partially disband. They did so, and for a few years, as a corporate body, ceased to exist in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. A painful controversy with Mgr Afre, the future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, whose measures against the order in 1846 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to stop, was a sore trial to de Ravignon. Throughout he remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, respectful but firm to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Another trial awaited him. In the campaign for the Falloux Law (1850) for the liberty of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, though recognizing the shortcomings of the measures and trying to eliminate them, he urged the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to unite and to use their opportunities. He was accused of disrupting their ranks, of being a blind follower of de Falloux, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and Doupanloup. He was again triumphantly vindicated.

<p>Twice again de Ravignon came prominently before the public. In 1855 he preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons at the Tuileries, before <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> and Empress Eug&eacute;nie. Sickness had undermined his strength, but he spoke with much of his old vigour, and with the same authority and unction. In 1847 <a href="../cathen/04488a.htm">Cr&eacute;tineau-Joly</a> had published his "Clement XIV et les Jesuites". His strictures on <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> were severe and unfair. In 1852 the learned <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Augustine Theiner</a> had written his "Geschichte des Pontificats Clemens XIV". In it <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>, the defender of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, was attacked, <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, who <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a> them, wronged by injudicious flatteries. At the request of <a href="../cathen/13182a.htm">Fr. Roothaan</a>, de Ravignan wrote "Cl&eacute;ment XIII et Cl&eacute;ment XIV" (Paris, 1854, 2 vols.). He endeavoured to put the facts in their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light. The literary merit of the work is not the highest, but the author writes with impartiality and candour. The work of de Ravignan's last years, if not prominent or striking, was fertile in its results. The confessional, direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, retreats and conferences for noble ladies, familiar talks to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, employed his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Many thought him careless of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, but though anxious to do well, he preferred to do good. Several times his name was mentioned for the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Archepiscopal See of Paris</a>, but faithful to his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, he refused the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He preferred to work as a simple religious in every good cause. He championed the proclamation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, supported P&eacute;t&eacute;tot and <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a> in the reorganization of the French Oratory, and Muard in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of la Pierre-qui-Vire. After two months' sickness, tenderly watched by his friend, superior, and future biographer, de Ponlevoy, he died a saintly death. <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a> had <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> in tears at his bedside; <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Mgr Dupanloup</a> preached his funeral oration; thousands followed to "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>" to the grave.

<p>Besides the volumes mentioned, de Ravignon did not publish anything of great importance. The following works have been gathered and edited since: "Entretiens Spirituels" etc. (Paris, 1859, 7th ed., Paris, 1881); "Suite des entretiens spirituels", etc. (Paris, 1863, 2nd ed., 1871), tr. Ram, "Conferences on the Spiritual Life (London, 1873; 5th ed., New York, 1875); "La vie chr&eacute;tienne, d'une dame dans le monde" (Paris, 1861, 5th ed., 1895); "Father de Ravignan on <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>' (Dublin, 189-); "Pens&eacute;es et Maximes" (Paris, 1911); cf. also articles in "L'Amide Religion", CXXVI, CXXXIX to CLI, passim.
