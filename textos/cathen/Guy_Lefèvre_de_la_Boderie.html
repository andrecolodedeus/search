<h1>Guy Lef&egrave;vre de la Boderie</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> and poet; b. near Falaise in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, 9 August, 1541; d. in 1598 in the house in which he was born. At an early age he devoted himself to the study of Oriental languages, particularly Hebrew and Syriac. After much travelling in different provinces of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he settled down to uninterrupted study under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> Guillaume Postel, who was a professor in the College de France. Guy was an earnest student and his scientific ardour was intensified by the religious enthusiasm of his character. He was convinced that deep study and full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were the surest natural mainstays of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He felt, too, that if this was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> generally, it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in a very special way in regard to Biblical work. He became an <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> therefore, like many others, because he was an <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>. He selected Syriac and Aramaic generally as his special department that he might come nearer to the mind of Christ by the study of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> vernacular. His first published work of importance was a Latin version of the Syriac <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> published in 1560. This work attracted much attention, and in 1568 Guy was invited by <a href="../cathen/01711c.htm">Arias Montanus</a> to assist in the production of the Antwerp Polyglot. Guy accepted the invitation and proceeded to Antwerp with his brother Nicolas who was also an <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>.

<p>The work assigned to Guy by <a href="../cathen/01711c.htm">Arias Montanus</a> was the editing of the Syriac <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. He examined for this purpose a new Syriac <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which Guillaume Postel had brought from the East. In 1572 appeared in the fifth volume of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible the result of Lef&egrave;vre's work, entitled "Novum Testamentum syriace, cum versione latin&acirc;". This work included the collated Syriac text and Lef&egrave;vre's previously published (and now amended) Latin version. This work was republished by Le Jay in 1645 in the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Polyglot. In 1572 Lef&egrave;vre published at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> a short Syriac text which lie had found accidentally thrown together with the Eastern Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> above mentioned. This text, furnished with a Latin translation, appeared under the title "D. Seven, Alexandrini, quondam patriarch&aelig;, de Ritibus baptismi et sacr&aelig; synaxis apud Syros Christianos receptis liber". Lef&egrave;vre tells us (Epistola dedicatoria, p. 4 f.) that he published this text to illustrate the agreement of the ancient <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> with the Western in the important matter of sacramental ritual. To make the little text useful.for beginners in Syriac Lef&egrave;vre vocalized the text and added at the foot of the page a vocalized transliteration in Hebrew characters. In the sixth volume of the Antwerp Polyglot appeared a further work by Lef&egrave;vre, "Grammatica chaldaica et Dictionarium Syro-Chaldaicum". In the same year 1572, Lef&egrave;vre published, also at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, a short introduction to Syriac, "Syriac&aelig; lingu&aelig; prima elementa". This work has no scientific value: it is little more than an account of the names of the consonants and vowel signs with a few easy texts. On completing his work in Antwerp in 1572 Lef&egrave;vre returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where he soon obtained the post of secretary and interpreter to the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on. In this position he was brought into close contact with the somewhat radical thought of the period. His associates were men like Ba&iuml;f, Dorat, <a href="../cathen/13180b.htm">Ronsard</a>, Vauquelin de La Fresnaye, etc.

<p>But Lef&egrave;vre remained, in spite of all, a strong <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a steady enemy of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. in 1584 he published a transliteration in Hebrew characters of the Syriac <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, "Novum J. Chr. Testamentum, syriace litteris hebraicis, cum versione latin&acirc; interlineari". In this work the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and Greek texts were printed at the foot of the page. But Lef&egrave;vre was not merely a philologist; he was also a poet. his poetic flights, however, were not high, and in his poetry, as in his Orientalia, the apologetic trend of his thought is clear, he was as his friend Vauquelin de La Fresnaye said of him <em>poete tout chrestien</em>. Among his more important poetic performances are: "L'Encyclie des secrets de l'Eternit&eacute;" (Antwerp, 1571), an apology of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; "La Galliade, ou de la r&eacute;volution des arts et sciences" (Paris, 1578; 2nd ed. 1582). which celebrates the return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of the banished <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; "Hymnes eccl&eacute;siastiques" and "Cantiques spirituels et autres m&eacute;langes po&eacute;tiques" (Paris, 1578-1582), many of which are translations from the Italian L'Harmonie du Monde" (Paris, 1582), a translation of Latin work. Lef&egrave;vre published in his last years an immense number of translations from Latin, Italian, Spanish etc., in verse and prose. Most of these translations are apologetic, and few of them are of any value. Lef&egrave;vre shows by the choice of his life-work that his thoughts were ahead of his time. Of his life, apart from his writings, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> next to nothing. It has been conjectured from some words of his in a poem addressed to Marguerite de France that he was an ecclesiastic; and it has been said that <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> wished to make him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. But Lef&egrave;vre would not allow himself to be led away in his last days from his books to the Roman Court. He died in the peaceful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> mansion of La Boderie in 1598. An epitaph which he wrote for himself sums up his life work simply and well:

<blockquote><p>Tandisque j'ai vescu, j'ai toujours souhait&eacute; <br>Non d'amasser tr&eacute;sors, mais chercher Verit&eacute;. </p></blockquote>
