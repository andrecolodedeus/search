<h1>Gu&eacute;rin</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Eug&eacute;nie de Gu&eacute;rin</h2>

<p>A French writer; b. at the ch&acirc;teau of La Cayla, in Languedoc, 15 January, 1805; d. there 5 June, 1848. The Gu&eacute;rins were descended from an old noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, originally from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which has lived for centuries in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Among their ancestors, they counted <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, several <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and Grand Masters of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Order of St. John of Jerusalem</a>. In spite of their noble origin, they were in very moderate circumstances at the beginning of the nineteenth century. M. de Gu&eacute;rin, the father, had lost his wife when Eug&eacute;nie was thirteen years old, and was left with four children, Eug&eacute;nie, Marie, Eremberg, and Maurice. Upon her death-bed, the mother, more deeply attached to Maurice than to any of the others, because of his beauty and his delicate health, commended him to the care and solicitude of Eug&eacute;nie, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him dearly. In fact, her whole life was devoted to her brother. Had she been free to follow her own desires, she would have entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>; but she remained in the world for the sake of Maurice. Her life was spent entirely in the loneliness of the old homestead, which she left only once, for a few months, in 1838, when she went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to attend the wedding of her brother. Her way of living was simple and eminently <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. After she had discharged her household <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, she would indulge in reading. The lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> sermons, and other religious works were her favorite reading. She interested herself also in literature, and her "Journal" shows that she had read Homer, Virgil, <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, Scott, Goldsmith, not to mention all the great masters of French literature. Speaking of her reading, she said: "I read, not to become learned, but to raise my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>." Her main concern, however, was for her brother. From the day when he left home to go to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and afterwards, especially when he was at La Ch&ecirc;naie and in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, she frequently wrote long letters to him, most of which unfortunately are lost. In 1834 she began a "Journal" or diary of events, which was sent to her brother from time to time. Both in her letters and "journal", she related the insignificant facts of her lonely life, her impressions of nature, her innermost thoughts, and, above all, spoke to him of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. During the unfortunate period when he renounced his Faith, she became more tender and loving, in order that her advice might be more surely listened to. Her devotion was rewarded; for, a few months before his death, he returned to the fold. She survived him only eight years, seeking for no other relief to her bereavement than <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Her "Journal" had been written for Maurice only, and was not intended for publication. It was, however, printed under the title of "Reliqui&aelig;" (Caen, 1855), first for private circulation. Seven years later a public edition entitled "Journal et lettres d'Eug&eacute;nie de Gu&eacute;rin" (Paris, 1862), met with considerable success and has been reprinted many times. Together with her devotion to her brother, and her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, we admire the simple and vivid style of the writer. She loves to depict the scenic beauties that surrounded her, and her descriptions are charming and free from that tinge of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> which is so often noticeable in admirers of nature.
<h2 id="section2">Georges-Maurice de Gu&eacute;rin</h2>

<p>A French poet, brother of Eug&eacute;nie; b. at the ch&acirc;teau of La Cayla, in Languedoc, 5 August, 1810; d. there, 19 July, 1839. At the age of thirteen he went to the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and two years later to the Coll&ecirc;ge Stanislas, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He then thought of becoming a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1832 he went to La Ch&ecirc;naie, where <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> had established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of higher religious studies. He met there <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned men, among whom must be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Abb&eacute; Gerbet</a>, afterwards a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the Abb&eacute; de Cazal&egrave;s, whose <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussions he related in his journal. He remained at La Ch&ecirc;naie a little more than a year, and it seems that <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> did not pay much attention to him. In the month of February, 1834, he was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, trying to find a position. He was soon imbued with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the world, and lost his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He hoped for a time to enter the College of Juilly as instructor, but was disappointed and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to accept a position as substitute in the Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas. He occasionally contributed articles to a magazine, "La <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Catholique". His life was saddened by his naturally dreamy disposition and a vague regret for his lost <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Though surrounded by a choice circle of friends, in which he had ample opportunity to display his brilliant qualities, he suffered from constant weariness and poor health. Towards the end of 1838 he married a young Indian girl, whom Eug&eacute;nie describes as a "charming and refined creature". A few months later, yielding to his sister's entreaties, he returned to Le Cayla, and at the same time came back to the Faith of his childhood, and died piously in 1839. His fame as a writer began only one year after his death, when his poem "Le Centaure" appeared in the "Revue des Deux Mondes", together with an enthusiastic article from the pen of George Sand. He then ranked among the great poets of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, though it may be said that this <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> composition was praised a little beyond its real value. The remainder of his works were published for the first time, twenty years later, by Tr&eacute;butien (2 vols., Caen, 1860). By far the more interesting part is the "Journal", which was written day by day to be sent to his sister. His complete works have been published under the title of "Journal, Lettres et Po&egrave;mes". A joint edition of Maurice and Eug&eacute;nie's works has been given in three vols. (Paris, 1869).
