<h1>G&ouml;rz</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> GORIZIA; Slovene GORICA).

<p>Capital of the Austrian crown-land G&ouml;rz and Gradiska, has a population (1900) of 25,432, almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, of which 68 per cent are <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, 20 per cent Slovenes, and 11.6 per cent Germans. Since 1751 G&ouml;rz has been the seat of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The territory surrounding G&ouml;rz belonged originally to the old Roman Prefecture of Illyricum, on the division of which into East and West Illyricum in 379 it remained a part of the latter, and shared its fortunes until Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> divided it in 1001 between the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and the Count of Friuli. The latter immediately assumed the title of Duke of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> after the castle of that name, for the town of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> was not recognized as such until 1307. In 1031 G&ouml;rz passed to the Eppenstein <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Carinthia, and thence in 1090 to the Counts of Lurn, who in 1202, by arrangement with the patriarch, Pilgrim II, secured the territory belonging to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. By marriage Count Meinhard III came also into possession of the Tyrol. After his death (1258) the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> divided into the G&ouml;rz line, represented by Count Albert II, and the Tyrolese-Carinthian line, represented by Count Meinhard IV. The latter line became extinct in 1335 with Henry of Carinthia, who had been for a time King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1307-10); the G&ouml;rz line reached the zenith of its power under Henry II (d. 1323), among whose possessions were included Lusatia, Pusterthal, and Istria, and who held the office of vicegerent of the empire in the March of <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>. Unsuccessful <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, divisions of inheritance, etc. led to the decline of the house, and at the death of the last count, Leonhard, in 1500 without issue, his territory fell to Emperor Maximilian I, and, except for a brief interval of French occupation (1809-15), has since remained a possession of the reigning house of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>Ecclesiastically, this territory was from the beginning under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. The fact that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> for the most part resided at <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a> on <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> land, while the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was situated at <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> on G&ouml;rz territory, caused constant friction with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Accordingly, in 1560 Emperor Ferdinand I agitated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the question of establishing an independent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at G&ouml;rz, an attempt which was repeated many times during the following centuries, but fruitlessly until at last <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, yielding to Austrian urgency and overriding the claim of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> to the Austrian part of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, established a separate <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> with residence at G&ouml;rz (29 Nov., 1749). On 6 June, 1751, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was definitively suppressed and replaced by two archbishoprics (18 April, 1752), those of <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a> and G&ouml;rz, the latter having as suffragans <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, <a href="../cathen/15045a.htm">Triest</a>, <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, and Pedena. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Karl Michael, Count von Attems, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of G&ouml;rz, and in 1766 was raised to the dignity of a prince. After his death (1774) came Rudolf, Count of Edling, who was, however, deposed by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> in 1784 for his opposition to the imperial patent of tolerance of 13 October of that year, and died in 1803 at <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a>. On 8 March, 1787, the emperor raised the <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Diocese of Laibach</a> to the rank of an archdiocese, and on 20 August, 1788, in place of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> established a new diocese in the adjacent province of Gradiska. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> gave his sanction to the new arrangement on the condition that Gradiska should be regarded only as a co-episcopal seat (with G&ouml;rz); by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Recti prudentisque consilii" of 12 September, 1797, however, he transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> and chapter back to G&ouml;rz, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that in future the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should bear both titles, G&ouml;rz and Gradiska. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 19 August, 1807, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> reduced <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a> to the rank of a simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and placed it with G&ouml;rz and Triest under the immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Finally, on 27 August, 1830, <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> raised G&ouml;rz once more to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank, and assigned to it the Sees of <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a>, <a href="../cathen/15045a.htm">Triest-Capo d'Istria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11480a.htm">Parenzo-Pola</a>, and Veglia-Arbe as suffragans, Joseph Walland becoming <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Since Archbishop Walland's death the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> has been occupied by: Franz Xaver Luschin (1835-54), distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and unbounded charity; Andreas Gollmayr (1855-83), under whom the title of prince was restored to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>; Alois Zorn (1883-97), previously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480a.htm">Parenzo-Pola</a>; Jakob Missia (1898-1902), raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, 19 June, 1899; Andreas Jordan (1902-05); and Franz Borgia Sedej, b. at Kirchheim, 10 October, 1854; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 26 August, 1877; appointed prince-archbishop by the emperor, 20 January, 1900; confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 21 February of the same year, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 25 March.
