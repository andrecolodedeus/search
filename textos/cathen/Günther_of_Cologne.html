<h1>G&uuml;nther of Cologne</h1>  

<p>(also GUNTHAR)

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of that city, died 8 July, 873. He belonged to a noble <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and, if we may believe the poet Sedulius Scottus (Carm. 68 sqq. in "Mon. Germ. Hist.", Poet&aelig; Lat., III, 221 sqq.), was a man of great ability. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> on 22 April, 850 (Annal. Col., ad an. 850). For a long time he refused to cede his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Diocese of Bremen</a> to St. Ansgar who, in order to facilitate his missionary labours, desired to unite it with his Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. The affair was finally settled (c. 860) by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> in favour of St. Ansgar, and G&uuml;nther reluctantly consented. G&uuml;nther, who had become arch-chaplain of King Lothair II, received an unenviable <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> through his unjustifiable conduct in the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of this licentious king from his lawful wife Thietberga. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in January, and another in February, 860, a few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, under the leadership of G&uuml;nther, compelled Thietberga to declare that before her marriage with the king she had been violated by her brother. Upon her compulsory confession the king was allowed to discard her and she was condemned to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. At a third <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in April, 862, G&uuml;nther and a few other Lorrainese <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> allowed the king to marry his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> Waldrada. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> sent two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to investigate the case, but the king bribed them, and at a synod which they held in <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, in June, 863, the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> was approved. G&uuml;nther and his tool Thietgaud, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, were bold enough to bring the acts of the synod to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and ask for his approval. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in the Lateran in October, 863, at which the decision of the Synod of Mets was rejected, and G&uuml;nther and Thietgaud, who refused to submit, were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed. The two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> drew up a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> document of seven chapters (reprinted in P.L., CXXI, 377-380) in which they accused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of having <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them. They sent copies of the document to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the rebellious Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lorraine. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, did not waver even when Emperor Louis II appeared before <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an army for the purpose of forcing him to withdraw the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. Though <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed, G&uuml;nther returned to Cologne and performed <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, 864. When, however, the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lorraine and King Lothair submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, G&uuml;nther and Thietgaud appeared before the synod which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> convened at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in November, 864, asking to be released from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and restored to their sees, but they were unsuccessful. After the accession of <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a>, G&uuml;nther and Thietgaud returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 867. Thietgaud was now freed from the ban, but G&uuml;nther remained <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> until the summer of 869, when, after a public retraction (P.L., CXXI, 381), he was admitted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to lay communion at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. The See of Cologne had in 864 been given by Lothair to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Hugo, a nephew of Charles the Bald. He was deposed in 866 and G&uuml;nther regained his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Being under the ban, G&uuml;nther engaged his brother Hilduin of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> to perform <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions in his place. After the death of G&uuml;nther's protector, Lothair II, Willibert was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (7 January, 870). Seeing that all efforts to regain his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> would be useless, G&uuml;nther acknowledged the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and left Cologne for good.
