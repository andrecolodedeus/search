<h1>Haarlem</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF HAARLEM (HARLEMENSIS).

<p>One of the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Archdiocese of Utrecht</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. The city of Haarlem is the capital of the Province of North <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and is about nine miles distant from <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Diocese of Utrecht being ill-adapted on account of its great extent to oppose successfully the nascent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> divided it by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Super universas orbis" (12 May, 1559) into an archdiocese and five suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The principal of these five was the Diocese of Haarlem. At that time it only comprehended the present Province of North <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> with a small portion of South <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. The right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was bestowed on King Philip of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and his successors. On 10 March, 1561, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul's</a> successor, incorporated the Abbey of Egmond in the diocese in perpetuity as the episcopal mensa (or chief means of revenue) by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Sacrosancta Romana" (10 March, 1561). One day later (11 March, 1561), <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex injuncto nobis", in which the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was defined, 11 towns and 151 villages being mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-church of Haarlem, dedicated to St. Bavo, was made into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Nicolas van Nieuwland, formerly assistant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. He was appointed by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 26 May, 1561. In April, 1564, he held a synod, the proceedings of which are still in print. When after the iconoclastic outbreak of 1566, then fortunately prevented in Haarlem, the <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a> was sent to punish the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wrote him a letter trying to move him to deal leniently with the guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1569, on account of his sluggishness, caused in part by the gout from which he was suffering, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by Alva to send in his resignation to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Godfried van Mierlo, formerly Provincial of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> for the Province of Lower <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, a man conspicuous for virtue, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and eloquence. At first appointed to act as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (<em>sede vacante</em>), <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> created him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Haarlem and Prelate of Egmond on 11 December, 1570. He established the episcopal chapter in 1571, and convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in the same year. His efforts to make the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> conform to the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> were soon interrupted by the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. On 30 April, 1572, Haarlem joined the side of the Prince of Orange, the leader of the revolt, but, when in the following July a mob of foreign and ribald soldiery came to garrison the town, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> fled and sought refuge in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> Ter Kamere near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. A year later, when the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> had recaptured the town, he returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, and on 15 August, 1573, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> anew the <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> and pillaged <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. For the next three years Haarlem remained in the power of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> did everything he could for the spiritual and temporal welfare of his flock, which, already thinned and impoverished by the siege, was now sorely afflicted by the Spanish garrison. Negotiations were opened with the Prince of Orange at Veere, and in January, 1577, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> personally took part in the transaction resulting in a sworn compromise, which conceded equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of religious worship to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and delivered one of the churches within the town-walls, the Onzelieve Vrouwekerk on the Bakenessergracht, to the latter <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. This condition of affairs lasted only for a year and a half, as on <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> (29 May), 1578, the so-called <em>Nona Harlemiana</em> took place. With the connivance of the authorities the sworn compact was <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalously</a> broken. At ten o'clock in the morning, when the procession of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was just starting inside the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, soldiers with drawn swords entered the sacred edifice, assaulted the defenceless people, plundered the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, wounded the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and committed sacrileges of all sorts. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> escaped, fled from the town disguised as a cattle-driver, came to <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, where he acted as <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, and lived in the greatest poverty till his death at Deventer in 1587.

<p>In 1592 all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> under <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> civil government were placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, the entire diocese of Haarlem thus becoming a portion of the Missio Batava. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> remained for a long time in the majority in the former diocese, but they were excluded from all public offices, and the exercise of their religion was forbidden by law under penalty of fines and exile. Nevertheless the old worship was continued in secret, either with the connivance of the magistrates in consideration of large bribes, or even at the risk of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and exile. At first there were scarcely any but <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, but in 1592, at the express wish of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, the first two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> came to assist the seculars, being followed in the seventeenth century by members of various other orders.



<p>From the second half of the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> began to abate; it became more and more apparent that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> could not be exterminated, and the exigencies of trade were decidedly opposed to extreme measures. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> barn and house-chapels were connived at, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were tolerated on payment of a pecuniary fine. In this manner the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> remained very considerable in most towns, and even predominated in many villages. In the beginning of the eighteenth century occurred the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist schism</a>, long since prepared for by the jealousy and quarrels between the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the old Haarlem Diocese the principal <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, the so-called Chapter of Haarlem, shrank from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and the great majority of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In consequence of the disturbances, the mission was, in 1721, placed directly under the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, who exercised his functions under the title of vice-superior, until the nunciature was abolished in 1794. On the whole the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were for the greater part of the eighteenth century allowed to exercise their religion without much hindrance, provided they obtained the consent of the government and worshipped in churches not outwardly recognizable as such; however, their exclusion from all public offices was rigorously maintained. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> revolution of 1795 was to bring some change in this inequality between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and non-Catholic citizens. In 1796 the supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/02346b.htm">Batavian</a> Republic, the National Assembly, declared the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> State Church abolished, decreed equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the exercise of religious worship to all creeds, and granted equality before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to all citizens of the State. These articles were subsequently embodied in the fundamental law of 1798.

<p>Nevertheless, a great many years were still to elapse before <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could obtain in fact the full enjoyment of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> guaranteed to them. At that time the mission was governed, with authorization of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, by Luigi Ciamberlani (1794-1828), who was at first <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reside in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. In 1799, this vice-superior, making use of the legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> conferred, founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Warmond near Leyden, which still flourishes as the grand <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the present Diocese of Haarlem. King Louis Bonaparte (1806-1810) did much for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In his residential city &#151; first The Hague, afterwards Amsterdam &#151; he had his own <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, to which he admitted the public, and faithfully assisted at the religious services of his two <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, both excellent men and <em>pr&ecirc;tres non asserment&eacute;s</em> (priests who had refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> required by the French government). He contributed large funds to enable the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to build and restore their churches; he requested the vice-superior to take up his permanent abode in the royal residence of <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, and admitted some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the higher government offices. He even intended to have Amsterdam selected as an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, but the constant opposition of his brother, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Emperor Napoleon</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to abdicate in 1810. Under the direct reign of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> from 1810-1813 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the old diocese shared to a great extent in the financial losses caused by his commercial policy (Continental blockade) and his financial operations (<em>tier&ccedil;age</em>), but with regard to religion they were left in peace. The Archpriest of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Zeeland, who under the vice-superior in Amsterdam directed the affairs of the mission in these provinces, repeatedly obtained from the minister of worship exemption from military service for the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students of Warmond.

<p>The reign of King William I (1815-1840) was not favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Although the constitution of 1815 granted them equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the king listened too much to counsellors who grudged the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the enjoyment of this liberty. In 1817 a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, called Hageveld and destined for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the future aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Zeeland, was opened near Velsen. In 1847 it was transferred to Voorhout near Leyden, and though, of course, much enlarged, still serves for the same purpose. Though much admired as a seat of virtue and learning, William ordered it to be closed, in 1825, because he wished to force on the future <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the unclerical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his Philosophical College at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. He also continued to exclude the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> completely from official positions. In 1827 he concluded a concordat with <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, by which Amsterdam was again selected as one of the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, but this was never put into execution, mainly in consequence of the subsequent revolt of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. His successor, the generous William II (1840-1849), was much more favourably inclined towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; yet intolerance was too powerful to allow even this liberal-minded monarch to put the concordat into execution. However, in 1848 a revision of the constitution in a liberal sense was taken in hand, and this was destined to advance rapidly the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the same year by the arrival of the newly-appointed vice-superior, Monsignor Belgrado, at <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a> as the first permanent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to William II. In the following years several addresses were sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, requesting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to restore to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> episcopal government, as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their spiritual and social development and not opposed by any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the State.
<h2>The new diocese</h2>

<p>On 4 March, 1853, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> acceded to the fervent wishes of the numerous <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Ex qua die arcano" restored the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. For the sake of tradition Utrecht was again made an archdiocese, but the Diocese of Haarlem was now made much larger than in 1559, the whole of South <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and the islands of the Province of Zeeland being added to it. It numbered then 199 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by 317 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, whilst the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were reckoned at 259,577 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have since occupied the See of Haarlem: (1) F. J. van Vree (1853-1861), a man of exceptional organizing talents. In the seven years of his episcopate he erected a chapter, circumscribed the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, some of which were assigned to regulars, drew up regulations for vestry-men and guardians of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> poor, took special care of neglected children and fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and prepared a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for use in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. (2) G. P. Wilmer (1861-1877). In 1867 he called together a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, the first after three centuries, in which the provisional settlement of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as arranged by his predecessor was finally concluded and declared permanent. Zealous for the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he purchased the locality near Brielle, where, according to the decisive arguments of Professor Smit of Warmond, four secular and fifteen <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had been cruelly <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in 1572, and where their bodies had been <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>. He also began at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a canonical process to obtain approval of the "immemorial" veneration of the Blessed Lidwina of Schiedam. He regulated the contributions to the <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a> for the whole of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Pursuant to the "Mandamus" of the collective <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> (1868), he was unwearied in his efforts for the preservation, the success, and the increase of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> denominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. To further this end he nominated a committee of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> and prominent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> (Union for the promotion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the Diocese of Haarlem), and united all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school-teachers into a separate body. The preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Hageveld was considerably enlarged during his episcopate. Finally he strongly encouraged the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> secretary, J. J. Graaf, in establishing the episcopal museum at Haarlem, and in starting with his colleague, I. F. Vregt, the publication of a periodical, "Contributions to the History of the Diocese of Haarlem". (3) P. M. Snickers (1877-1883). On account of the great concourse of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> on the field of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> near Brielle, this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> caused a large <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and covered galleries to be built there. For the housing of the rich collections of books and precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> he erected a separate building near the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Warmond. He approved for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the Gregorius Vereeniging (Society of Saint Gregory) for the promotion of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain chant</a> and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a>, founded by M. J. A. Lans, professor at Hageveld. In 1883 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was transferred to the Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. (4) C. J. M. Bottemanne (1883-1903). Although sixty years of age when he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, this energetic man did much for the development of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> increased during his episcopate to over 200, so that even in the villages a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> without a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> became the exception, while in the towns many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were opened. From his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> he selected able men to act as inspectors of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; at Hoorn he opened a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training college. He showed no less diligence in dealing with the social question. In 1888, three years before the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the Papal <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Rerum Novarum", a Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Workman's League (De R.K. Volksbond) was founded under his auspices. This league or union is meant to embrace all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workmen of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in 1903 numbered 16,000 members. Soon afterwards the master-workmen were also brought together in a special league, De R.K. Gildenbond (The League of Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Guilds). Bishop Bottemanne favoured greatly public meetings, which he addressed on many occasions. In 1897 he laid the foundation stone of an important addition to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Warmond, which was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> dedicated two years later on the occasion of the centenary of the institution. During this episcopate twenty-five new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were established and seventy churches <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. At the celebration of the golden jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (1896), Bishop Bottemanne instituted the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in such a way that day and night throughout the year the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is solemnly exposed for adoration in some church or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Bavo is another evidence of the flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This noble edifice &#151; new, though not startling in conception &#151; was designed by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> architect, Joseph Cuypers. It is situated in a new quarter of Haarlem, mainly inhabited by workmen, who use it as their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. At first only the choir and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> were built, taking three years to complete, and on 2 May, 1898, the aged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of consecrating this part of the great work. (5) A. J. Callier (1903--). For eleven years he had been <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, when he was appointed successor to Monsignor Bottemanne. The plans laid down and partly executed by his predecessor were now further developed. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> question was the object of his special care. In 1904 a boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened near the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; in 1906 the training college was transferred from Hoorn to a new and commodious building at Beverwyk. With regard to higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are still suffering under the old system of partiality and exclusion; but, as the new <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> permit them to have professors of their own attached to the state-universities, provided they pay for them, the Saint Radbout's Fund (St. Radbouts Stichting) was set on foot by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to secure co-religionists as professors, with the additional intention of preparing the way for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. To promote still further the solution of the social question, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> laid the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the assistance and development of citizens of the middle-class engaged in trade, a very large number of whom belong to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Wherever possible <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> clubs for youths are instituted to safeguard young men against the special dangers of their age and to promote their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and religious development. When <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to his predecessor, the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the moving spirit in the building of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and he personally devised the highly significant scheme of symbolism for this sacred edifice. In 1903 the work was resumed, and three years later the exterior of the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was finished, except the two towers and the decoration of the west <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. As to the interior decoration, this remains the object of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> special care, and is being effected (1909) with the greatest deliberation. Both decoration and furniture must be in keeping with the artistic value of the building itself, and great artists of original mind, as Brom, Toorop, and Mengelberg, have ample opportunity given to them to display their exceptional talent. The diocese counts (1909) 234 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, served by 650 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seculars and regulars; the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are reckoned at about 510,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
