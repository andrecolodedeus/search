<h1>Hadrian</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, died about the year 306. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Constantinople <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> the grave of this victim of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. We are told by <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legendary</a> and unverified records, which have been preserved in Greek and Latin, that Hadrian was an officer in the bodyguard of <a href="../cathen/06341a.htm">Emperor Galerius</a>. In this capacity he was present one day, with the emperor, at the trial and torture of twenty-two <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. He was so impressed that he forthwith declared himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and with the others was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. His wife, Natalia, who had secretly become one herself, cheered and ministered to her husband and his fellow-prisoners. The account given in the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a> is embellished with a number of legendary and, in part, very poetical details. Hadrian and his companions in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> were finally <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Their members were first broken, after which they were delivered up to the flames. Natalia is supposed to have brought to Constantinople the mortal remains of her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> husband. Another legend speaks of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Hadrian of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, who figures in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a> and in the Greek <a href="../cathen/10177b.htm">Menaion</a> under 26 August. Though different in detail, the story deals with the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The remains of St. Hadrian were later laid in the church erected under his name and <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patronage</a> on the Roman forum, which church (S. Adriano al Foro) is standing at the present day. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the translation, which, in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> is the principal feast of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and of his companions, is celebrated on 8 September. The Roman Martyrology, however, mentions them also on 4 March, while the Greek <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendar</a> places their feast on 26 August. On this last <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the Roman Martyrology likewise makes mention of a Hadrian.
