<h1>Hair (in Christian Antiquity)</h1>  

<p>The subject of this article is so extensive that there can be no attempt to describe the types of head-dress successively or simultaneously in use in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. An <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> can be formed only from the texts and monuments quoted, and here we shall simply indicate the principal characteristics of head-dress at different times and among different classes.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> permit the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> simply followed the fashion of their time. The short hair of the men and the waved tresses of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were, towards the end of the second century, curled, frizzed with irons, and arranged in tiers, while for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> the hair twined about the head forming a high diadem over the brow. Particular locks were reserved to fall over the forehead and upon the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. Religious iconography proceeds even now in accordance with types created in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Images of Christ retain the long hair parted in the middle and flowing to the shoulders. Those of the Blessed Virgin still wear the veil which conceals a portion of the brow and confines the neck. The Orantes, which represent the generality of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, have the hair covered by a full veil which falls to the shoulders. Byzantine iconography differs little as to head-dress from that of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. Mosaics and ivories portray emperors, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the faithful wearing the hair of a medium length, cut squarely across the forehead. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> then wore a round head-dress which encircled the face. Emperors and empresses wore a large, low crown, wide at the top, ornamented with precious stones cut <em>en cabochon</em>, and jeweled pendants falling down to the shoulders, such as may be seen in the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of S. Vitalis at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and a large number of <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. The hair of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was of medium length and was surmounted by a closed crown or a double <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>.

<p>The barbarians allowed their hair to grow freely, and to fall unrestrained on the shoulders. After the fall of the Merovingians, and while the barbarian invaders were conforming more and more to the prevailing Byzantine taste or fashion, they did not immediately take up the fashion of cutting the hair. Carloman, the brother of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, is represented at the age of fourteen with his hair falling in long tresses behind. The councils regulated the head-dress of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The "Statuta antiqua Ecclesiae" (can. xliv) forbade them to allow hair or <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> to grow. A <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> (can. vi) in 456 prescribed that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should dress their hair in the manner of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and those who allowed their hair to grow were expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (can. x). The <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> (506) authorized the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> to employ force in cutting the hair of recalcitrants; that of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (572) ordained that the hair should be short, and the ears exposed, while the Council of Toledo (633) denounced the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> in Galicia who wore a small <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and allowed the hair to grow immoderately, and two Councils of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (721 and 743) <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> those who should neglect the regulations in this matter. This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> only shows how inveterate was the contrary custom. The insistence of the councils is readily explained if we recall the ridiculous fantasies to which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> permitted themselves to go. Whether through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> or a taste for the bizarre, we see, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> testimony, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a> like goats, and the "Vita Hilarionis" also states that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> considered it meritorious to cut hair each year at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.

<p>In the ninth century there is more distinction between freemen and slaves, as regards the hair. Henceforth the slaves were no longer shorn save in punishment for certain offences. Under Louis the D&eacute;bonnaire and Charles the Bald the hair was cut on the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and the back of the head. In the tenth century the hair cut at the height of the ears fell regularly about the head. At the end of twelfth century the hair was shaven close on the top of the head and fell in long curls behind.

<p>Thus people passed from one fashion to another, from hair smooth on the top of the head and rising in a sudden roll in front, a tuft of hair in the form of a flame, or the more ordinary topknot. Not every one followed these fashions, but the exceptions were considered ridiculous. If anyone wishes to form an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the head-dress of the more modern epoch, pictures, stamps, and books furnish so many examples that it is useless to attempt description. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> followed with a sort of timidity the fashion of the wig, but, except <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, they refrained from the over-luxurious models. Priests contented themselves with wearing the wig <em>in folio</em>, or square, or the wig <em>&aacute; la Sartine</em>. They bared the part corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. The decadence of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders has always been noticeable in the head-dress. The <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> very early interposed an obstacle to fantastic styles, but the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> itself was the occasion of many combinations.
