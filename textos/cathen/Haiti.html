<h1>Haiti</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> <em>Santo Domingo, Hispaniola</em>.)

<p>An island of the Greater Antilles.
<h2 id="section1">Statistics</h2>

<p>The area is 28,980 square miles; population about 1,900,000. The chief products are coffee, sugar, cotton and tobacco.

<p>The island is divided into the Republic of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> in the east, and the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> Republic of Haiti in the west. The latter covers 11,070 square miles with 1,579,630 inhabitants in 1909 (Church statistics). The language is a debased French (Creole); the religion, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, although the natives are still widely affected with African fetichism (<em>Voodoo</em> or snake-worship). Education is deficient; it requires a yearly appropriation of 1,000,000 dollars. In addition to nearly 400 State free elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, there are five public <em>lyc&eacute;es</em>.

<p>The president is the head of the Republic (salary &#163;4800). The Chamber of Deputies consists of ninety-five members. The senate numbers thirty-nine members. The revenue amounted for the financial year ending 30 Sept., 1907, to $2,547,664 (U. S. gold), and 6,885,660 paper <em>gourdes</em>. In 1907 the foreign <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> was $11,801,861; the home <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, $13,085,362. The army consists of 6828 men; there is a special "guard of the government," numbering 650 men, commanded by 10 generals. The Republic possesses a fleet of six small vessels. The exports were valued in 1907 at $14,330,887, of which nearly $3,000,000 went to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> &mdash; in 1906-07, $2,916,104, while the imports from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to Haiti for the same period were only $1,274,678. The capital is Port-au-Prince (population 75,000).
<h2 id="section2">Political history</h2>

<p>Haiti (i.e., the "hilly country") was discovered by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, 6 December, 1492. In December, 1493, <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> founded Port Isabella, which was soon re-named <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>.&mdash;As the aborigines soon became extinct the importation of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> began about 1517. But the colony fell into decay, when, about 1638, the filibusters obtained a footing at <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, and harassed commerce. After 1659 French settlements were established on the west side of the island with the help of the filibusters, which led to the definite occupation by the French at the Peace of Ryswijck (1697). While the parts left to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> became more and more impoverished and depopulated, the French colony flourished greatly until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> also affected Haiti, and there led to an insurrection of the blacks in which the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> Toussaint L'Ouverture finally in 1800 made himself dictator, declared Haiti's independence, and gave the country a constitution. He was soon overthrown by the French general Leclere and sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> Dessalines, the author of a massacre of whites in 1804, was proclaimed James I, Emperor of Haiti, 8 Oct., 1804, but he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> two years later in a conspiracy under Christophe and P&eacute;tion.

<p>Christophe thereupon established another <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> state in the north which he ruled from 1811 to 1820 as King Henry I; while P&eacute;tion in the south founded a mulatto republic, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> re-conquered the eastern part which she had surrendered to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the Peace of Basle (1795). Christophe's successor, Boyer, united all three parts of the island in 1822, but he was driven out in 1843, and the eastern part declared itself the independent <a href="../cathen/05110a.htm">Dominican Republic</a> on 27 Feb., 1844. The western part became again an "empire" under Soulouque (Emperor Faustin I) in 1849, but a republic was again proclaimed by the mulatto Geffrard after the expulsion of Soulouque in 1859. Geffrard was replaced by the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> party under Salnave, 13 March, 1867. then followed a succession of presidents, who were nearly all disturbed by revolution, and under whom the republic was brought to the verge of ruin by civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, financial maladministration, corruption, and thoughtlessly occasioned conflicts with <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Powers. Even today (1909) the country has not yet settled down after the last revolution in the autumn of 1908.
<h2 id="section3">Mission history</h2>

<p>On the erection of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> and Concepci&oacute;n de la Vega, in 1511, the whole island was divided between these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. In 1527 Concepci&oacute;n was suppressed, and its territory united to <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, which was the only diocese until 1862. Many <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> came with the French into the French territory, especially the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> devoted themselves especially to the mission in the western part of the colony, and were for a time supported therein by other orders and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were also designated as missionaries to the southern part of the island. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, who looked after the northern part of the island, and were likewise assisted by other orders and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, soon were unable to supply enough missionaries. On that account they gave up this mission in 1704, and in their place came the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who worked there until their expulsion at the end of 1763. Secular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> followed, but after five years they were superseded by <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> brought confusion into the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took the constitutional <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and in the northern part of the country Divine worship ceased. while the mission in the west, uninterfered with under the British occupation (1794-8), was able to improve more and more. But in the south the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, P&egrave;re Viriot, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. When Toussaint L'Ouverture came to power in 1800, he restored its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. But meanwhile the council of Constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> had nominated a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, who, however, obtained no recognition either from Toussaint or the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. In 1802 General Leclere restored the former jurisdictions of Cap-Ha&iuml;tien and Port-au-Prince, and named as prefects Apostolic P&egrave;res Corneille Brelle, O. Cap., and Lecun, O. P., these arrangements being confirmed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On account of the massacre of 1804 nearly all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> left the colony, so that for that two years the only religious services given at <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a> were held by a former <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>. After the overthrow of James I (1806) some missionaries returned.

<p>After many years of fruitless negotiations, a <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordat</a> was signed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 March, 1860. In Dec., 1860, Mgr. Monetti arrived as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>.

<p>The Concordat provides that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion shall enjoy the special protection of the Government. The president nominates the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can refuse them <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> receives an annual salary of 1200 francs from the State.

<p>Five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were erected in 1861; the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a>, and the suffragan Sees of Cap-Haitien, Les Cayes, Gona&iuml;ves, and Port-de-Paix. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a> at first administered all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. A separate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not appointed to Cap-haitien until 1873, and at the same time was entrusted with the administration of Port-au-Paix. In 1893 a separate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was appointed for Les Cayes; while Gona&iuml;ves is still administered by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. On the conclusion of the Concordat, three fathers of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a> and of the Holy Heart of Mary were sent to Port-au-Prince. These restored the regular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> organization in the capital. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, du Cosquer, and his successor, Quilloux, visited <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to enlist new <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Owing to the unhealthy tropical climate, death caused serious gaps in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; thus, at the beginning of 1906, out of 516 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had come from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> since 1864, 200 had died, 150 were still at their posts, and the rest were invalided to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. To ensure recruits, Mgr. du Cosquer established at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1864 the Saint-Martial Seminary, which was united with the Colonial Seminary conducted by the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>; it received a State subvention of 20,000 francs per annum, the payment of which, however, was suspended owing to the political troubles of 1867, and in 1869 it was entirely abrogated. When in 1870 owing to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> gave up direction of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, Mgr. Quilloux founded a new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Pontch&acirc;teau (<em>Loire inf&eacute;rieure</em>) in 1873 under the direction of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>. Finally in 1893 the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was removed to St-Jacques (Finisterre) and its direction entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; Pontch&acirc;teau Seminary had sent 196 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to Haiti, and St. Jacques, in 15 years (down to 1909) 171. In 1864, in the whole of Haiti, there were only 34 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> devoted to the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the 65 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 7 annexes. The progress which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has made in Haiti since then is shown by the fact that there are now (1909) 182 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 92 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>Of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, Haiti has: (1) at <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a> the "Petit S&eacute;minaire-Coll&egrave;ge," under the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> and of the Holy Heart of Mary. There is affiliated to it a children's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; also a meteorological observatory. A second observatory was founded by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>; (2) in Cap-Haitien, the College of Notre-Dame-du-Perp&eacute;tuel-Secours, directed by four <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> include: (1) the <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Christian Instruction</a>, who direct a secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a>, besides nine primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> elsewhere; (2) the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny direct a pensionnat at <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a>, and eighteen primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> elsewhere (also 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>); (3) the Sisters de la Sagesse, who direct a pensionnat in Port-au-Prince, 5 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 3 hospices. Of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> benevolent institutions there are: an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for girls and two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, of which one is supported at the cost of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, while the other is supported by the Dames Patronesses. The <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> also labours in Port-au-Prince. Among the religious associations mention may also be made of: the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, and the Confraternities of the Sacred Heart, the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>, the Children of Mary, the Christian Mothers, La Pers&eacute;v&eacute;rence, etc.
