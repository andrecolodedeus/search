<h1>Hakon the Good</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, 935 (936) to 960 (961), youngest child of King Harold Fair Hair and Thora Mosterstang. Harold several years previous to the birth of Hakon, had divided his realm among his sons by former wives and, except for a species of suzerainty over the whole, retained only the central portion of the country (Gulathingslagen) for himself. Hakon remained under his mother's care, and developed into a beautiful youth, in every respect like his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. But as his elder half-brothers showed but little <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him and even tried to compass his death, Harold determined to remove him out of harm's way and accordingly sent him to the court of his friend, King Athelstan of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who brought him up (hence his nickname Adelstenfostre) and gave him a splendid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Hakon was destined never to see his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> again, as the latter expired at the advanced age of eighty-three in 932 (or 933) at his residence at Hange, after a glorious reign of seventy years. His successor as ruler of the kingdom was Eric Blodoexe, who disarmed his brothers by craft and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and earned the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the people by his despotic temper. The disaffected nobles (Jarls) consequently turned to Hakon in the hope that he might take the reins of government into his hands and at the same time restore their old-time <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The ambitious youth gladly agreed to their views. Above all Hakon won the support of Sigurd, the leader of the nobility, who had given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of a sincere attachment to him from the very beginning, by promising him increased power; moreover, he managed to gain the goodwill of the freedmen by his clemency and liberality. Eric soon found himself deserted on all sides, and saved his own and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family's</a> lives by fleeing from the country. Hakon was now undisputed master of the nation, the unity of which seemed to be assured; of course the royal power was signally curtailed to the advantage of the people. Before he could feel secure on his throne, Hakon had to fight a dangerous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Danes. Having emerged victorious from this, he directed his efforts towards the improvement of domestic conditions as well as to the extension of his power abroad. Judiciously planned reforms in the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, government, and military affairs were carried out, and suitable measures were taken to promote commerce and to advance the deep sea fishing industry. At this juncture J&auml;mtland and Vermland were annexed to <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, provinces which that country afterwards lost to Sweden. Having been brought up a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and being firmly convinced of the benign influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> as well as the moral life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, Hakon attempted by precept and by duress to spread the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to root out <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> with its bloody <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. But meanwhile the sons of King Eric had grown up, and Hakon stood in need of the help of the entire nation in order to repel their invasion. Consequently, to his grief, he was compelled first to let matters rest half-way and subsequently to tolerate <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> which was still powerful. Finally, to escape the fury of the fanatical <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, he was forced to take part in their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, however, subsequently grew so arrogant as to demolish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the gallant prince determined to punish the criminals at all hazards and to enforce the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> he had enacted for the conversion of the nation. Taking advantage of the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that ensued, three of Eric's sons (Gamle, Harold, and Sigurd) landed unnoticed on Hoerdaland in 950 (961) and surprised the king at Fitje. The latter, although he was at the head of only a few faithful followers and vastly outnumbered, drove the enemy back to his ships. During the over-hasty pursuit of the vanquished, Hakon was struck in the forearm by an arrow, which caused the hero's death by h&aelig;emorrhage. He expressed his contrition for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before dying, begged the forgiveness of those who were present, and recommended his former enemy Harold as his successor, excluding his daughter Thora from the succession. As he had deemed himself unworthy of a <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> according to ancient custom as a warrior in a raised mound at his palace at Sacim near Lygren in Nordhoexdadalen. He left behind him an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> name. The people surnamed him "the Good", and historians extol him as the second founder of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway's</a> power. His memory lived long in songs and is not forgotten even today.
