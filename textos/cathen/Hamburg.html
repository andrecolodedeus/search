<h1>Hamburg</h1>  

<p>A city supposed to be identical with the Marionis of Ptolemy, was founded by a colony of fishermen from Lower Saxony, who settled on the wooded heights (<em>hamma-wald</em>) at the end of a tongue of land between the Elbe and the Alster, on the spot now occupied by the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter and the Johanneum Gymnasium. Between 805 and 810 <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> fortified the place and used it as a base of operations for the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the North. By permission of <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a>, Louis the Pious established there an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, in 831, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all missions in Scandinavia, Northern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, and Greenland. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was given to St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, but the piratical raids of the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> and the Obotrites compelled him to remove to Bremen. When, in 845, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> died, Ansgar sought to have the two sees united, and his request was granted, but the consolidation was not ratified by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> until 31 May, 864, Bremen being detached from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Province of Cologne. Ansgar died in 865, after preparing the way for the conversion of Sweden and giving new life to the missionary movement among the Danes. He was succeeded by his disciple Rimbert, a second Apostle of the North (865-88), who carried on the work of evangelization in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden in spite of repeated raids by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> and the Wends. Rimbert's immediate successors were St. Adalgar (888-909) and Holger (909-916), both of them <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Corvey, in whose time Cologne renewed its claims to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Under Reginwart (916-18), the successor of Holger, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was overrun by the Huns, who burned Bremen. Of the succeeding <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, St. Unni (918-36) became known as the third Apostle of the North, such was his energy, and so successful was he, in evangelizing <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden, while St. Adalgag (936-88) is credited with having established the suffragan Sees of Aarhuus (946), Schleswig (c. 948), Ripen (950), and Odensee (980), as well as the Wendish See of Oldenburg, later L&uuml;beck (940). Lubentius I (988-1013), an Italian, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a very able administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Like St. Ansgar, he was forced by the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> pirates to flee in order to save his own life and the sacred treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> see was established at <a href="../cathen/16074b.htm">Skara</a> during the incumbency of Unwann (1013-30). Lubentius II (1030-32) established a chapter of canons at Hamburg, the city having been rebuilt in 1015. He also founded a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and organized in a practical way the work of relieving the poor. The next <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Hermann (1032-35), who was succeeded by Bezzelin Alebrand (1035-43). The latter built the stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace, and transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Hamburg.

<p>The united See of Hamburg-Bremen reached both the height of its greatness and the depth of its misfortune under Adalbert the Great (1043-72), a scion of the royal Saxo-Thuringian line, and a remarkable man in every respect. He was contemporary with <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> (died c. 1076), the first and best of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> historians of North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Adam's chief work is the "Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesi&aelig; Pontificum" in four books, the third of which deals exclusively with the administration of Adalbert, whose loyal and devoted adherent he was, though he did not deny or conceal that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> weaknesses of mistakes. The political eminence attained by Adalbert makes Adam's work exceedingly important for the history of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. It may be noted that the fourth book of the "Gesta", entitled "Descriptio Insularum Aquilonis" (Account of the Islands of the North) is unique in its kind, and is in fact a geography of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and of the Baltic Coast so far as those regions were then known at <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. The decline of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Hamburg-Bremen was hastened under the administration of Adalbert's successors, Liemar (1072-1101) and Humbert (1101-04). On account of their opposition to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, they were compelled to reside outside of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Externally, the decline of Hamburg was indicated by the separation from it of the <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">See of Lund</a>, which became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the entire Germanic North. As the Wendish sees had already disappeared, Hamburg-Bremen had now only nominal suffragans. This state of affairs prevailed during the period following, in spite of the efforts of Frederick (1104-23) and Adalbero (1123-48). Hartwig I, of Stade (1148-68), a clever and energetic, but haughty, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who introduced brick into the construction of the many and magnificent churches which he built, made things worse by his quarrel with Henry the Lion, who, in the incumbency of Baldwin of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (1169-78), was not only the temporal lord of Hamburg-Bremen, but also dominated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. Whatever Sigfrid, the successor of Hartwig, accomplished in the brief period from 1178 to 1184 was undone under Hartwig II, of Ultede (1184-1207). His death was followed by a disputed election, the Hamburg chapter supporting the claims of Burkhard of Stumpenhusen, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, while the Bremen chapter chose for Bishop Waldemar of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>. Even the speedy death of Burkhard did not put an end to the conflict, and Gerhard I, of Oldenburg, though elected by the combined chapters in 1210, did not take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until 1216. Under Gerhard II, of Lippe (1219-58), the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was finally removed, in 1223, to <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, whence Bezzelin Alebrand (see above) had transferred it to Hamburg.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> importance of Hamburg thenceforward declined with the rapid growth of its commerce and its consequent political development, especially after the city had joined the Hanseatic League, in 1253. Despite temporary improvements, the condition of Hamburg on the whole grew worse from year to year, and at last the popular discontent with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> became so great that the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, generally accepted by the cities, was here welcomed with eagerness. It entered Hamburg in 1525, under the leadership of Magister Stiefel, of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> Kempe, the blacksmith Ziegenhagen, and others. As early as 1528 the faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were forced to leave the city, for which new religious regulations were made by Johann Bugenhagen, generally known as Doctor Pommer. The last Mass publicly celebrated at Hamburg was on 15 August, 1529. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were prohibited, while the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were secularized. The stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> built, in 1037, by Bezzelin Alebrand remained in the possession of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> until the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> placed it in the possession of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. It was given back to the city in 1802, but in 1805 was condemned as unsafe and was razed to the ground. The "Long Recess" <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 1529 commanded strict observance of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> creed and the prosecution and punishment of all who did not conform; while the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers, both in speech and writing, insisted upon rigorous enforcement of that <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>.

<p>Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> merchants and residents managed to re-establish themselves gradually, and as early as 1581 incorporated themselves as an independent community under the protection of the emperor, and found a home in the neighbouring city of Altona. Emperor Rudolf II issued an edict protecting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the molestation and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Hamburg magistrates. Relying upon this edict, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, led by the historian, Michael of Isselt, began missionary work. In spite of many obstacles they succeeded in opening two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> for religious services, one in the palace of the French envoy, the other in that of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had been converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The envoys from the courts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers furthered the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause by lending it valuable protection and influence. In 1671 Leopold I sent a most powerful protector in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of an imperial minister resident. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in his legation served the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Hamburg for more than a hundred years as their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church, until, on 10 September, 1719, a mob <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> and destroyed it. During the era of Illuminism the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was stirred up on the one hand by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preachers, who, in 1777, abandoned all use of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vestments, and on the other hand, especially after 1770, by many <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who sought and found asylum at Hamburg. Among these latter was the ex-Augustinian F. A. Fidler of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, who conducted a particularly vehement "Antipapistisches Journal", in which he reviled the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Hamburg, until he was taken into the service of the Duke of Mecklenburg as consistorial councillor and superintendent.

<p>In 1784 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Hamburg were officially recognized by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civic authorities</a> and were legally authorized to celebrate Divine worship. In 1792 they became independent of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Altona, even in respect to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. During the French occupation, in 1806 and in 1810-14, the prefect of the Department of Elbem&uuml;ndungen raised the mission to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and in 1811 established as its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> known as Little St. Michael's, which had grown out of the former <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the legation. The downfall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> did not disturb these privileges. Religious liberty, already fully established, was extended, in 1815, by Article 16 of the Decrees of the Confederation, which guaranteed civil equality to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This was also guaranteed later on by the Constitution of 28 September, 1860. New dangers arose in 1821-24 and in 1839, when <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> sought to make Hamburg the residence of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Northern Missions. These troubles, however, soon passed away. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for a long time suffered from lack of means, so that at times only one resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could be appointed. Not until 1831 was the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> able to support two.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established in 1840. The support of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is a heavy burden on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as the State refuses aid to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In the last three decades, not only has the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Hamburg greatly improved, but their numbers have materially increased. Of nearly 900,000 inhabitants, about 840,000 are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and some 18,000 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The State of Hamburg consists of the Hanseatic Free City itself and what is known as the <em>Vierlande</em> or Four Districts&#175;i.e. the Geestland and Marschland, Bergedorf and Ritzeb&uuml;ttel, the last-named including Cuxhaven, the four <em>Waldd&ouml;rfer,</em> or forest hamlets, of Farmsen, Volksdorf, Wohldorf, and Grosshausdorf, in Holstein, Geesthacht in Lauenburg, Moorburg and Gudendorf in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and the islands of Neuwerk and Scharh&ouml;rn. Notwithstanding the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs are supervised by the Senate. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> population is divided into four church districts, with 33 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and 100 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, under the government of a council and the synod. The 32,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> belong to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern Missions, under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, who appoints the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. Non-Lutheran <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are subject to a special board of control. Of the 28 places of worship in the city 18 are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and 5 Hebrew. There are altogether 6 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>: St. Michael, St. George, Eimsb&uuml;ttel, Hammerbrook, Rothenburgsort, and Barmbek. The oldest <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church is that of St. Ansgar, which dates from the eighteenth century and was formerly known as Little St. Michael's. Next come St. Boniface's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, dating from 1892. St. Mary's church, built in 1893 in Romanesque style, by G&uuml;ldenpfennig, with two steeples 200 feet high, St. Sophia's, built in 1900, by Beumer, in Early Gothic, and St. Joseph's, by the same architect, in 1901, in Late Gothic. There is another <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at the emigrant piers of the Hamburg-American Line, on the Veddel. Fifteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attend to the needs of these churches. According to the latest census (1905) there are altogether 143 elementary, or public, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>Volkschulen</em>), and of these 6 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> include one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> high school for boys (<em>Realschule</em> and <em>Progymnasium</em>). Among the 50 girls' high schools two are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, that of St. Johannis Kloster and that of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a>. More than one-third of the children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> attend <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and receive scanty <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious instruction, in many cases none at all. The loss sustained every year by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Hamburg in this way and through <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> is very considerable. There are several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, among them St. Joseph's Convent (<em>St. Josephstift</em>) and St. Mary's Hospital (1864), conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Borromean Sisters</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached. Towards the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Hamburg the Boniface Association has contributed in all, since 1858, about half a million marks ($125,000). Voluntary contributions are the only other resource, and, as the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are generally poor, great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> must be made for the preservation of the Faith. The social and charitable life of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Hamburg is sustained by numerous associations, among them the Gesellenverein and the Societies of St. Elizabeth and St. Vincent (three conferences each).
