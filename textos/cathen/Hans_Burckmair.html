<h1>Hans Burckmair</h1>  

<p>(Or Burgkmair).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the Swabian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1473; d. in 1531. He was the son of Toman, or Thomas Burckmair, and received his first lessons in are from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, then went, it appears, to <a href="../cathen/13553c.htm">Schongauer</a> in Alsace, and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In company with the <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">elder Holbein</a> he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, between the years 1501 and 1504, the seven great churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on panels in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> if St. Catherine of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. To Burckmair belong, among these, the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a>, the basilica of the Lateran, and the church of Santa Croce. The building itself is represented in the main compartment of each picture; above are, respectively, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the Garden of Gethsemane, the Scourging, and the Crucifixion. Following the titles of the churches there are, in the first picture, St. Peter, <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> and accompanied by the Fourteen Holy Martyrs; in the second, the legend of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, and in the third, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the Eleven Thousand Virgins. Several fine figures in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> show Italian influence. Not much later in date is the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of Christ and the Blessed Virgin, the latter wearing a crown; most charming figures of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and three groups of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are depicted on the wings as surrounding the central personages. The pictures just mentioned are in <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. Among the Madonnas at Nuremburg, the Madonna with the bunch of grapes is especially admired. An attractive genre picture with a background of harmonious tone that brings out the effect is the Holy Family in the Berlin Museum.

<p>The best of Burckmair's later panel pictures are: the Crucifixion, with <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> and the Emperor Heinrich on the wings, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1519 and now at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>; St. John in Patmos, and Esther before <a href="../cathen/02005c.htm">Assuerus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1528 (these two at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>). Several portraits still exist which Burckmair <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the later years of his life. Among these is one of the artist himself and his wife, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in 1529, now at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In this picture his wife holds a mirror in her hand in which two skulls are reflected.

<p>A woodcut of earlier date (1510) resembles a picture from a <a href="../cathen/04617a.htm">Dance of Death</a>. In this engraving Death stops a pair of lovers, throws the youth down, and strangles him; at the same time he seizes with his teeth the dress of the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who is fleeing. The woodcuts that Burckmair produced in the middle part of his career (1510-19), at the command of Emperor Maximilian, possess unusual merit. Only one of them, or, at most, very few were inserted in the emperor's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book. For the other books concerned with Maximilian or his ancestors Burckmair's work was as follows: for the "Osterreichische Heiligen" (Austrian Saints) Burckmair made 124 engravings on wood; for "Teuerdank" 12; for "The Triumph" over 60; for the "Weiszkunig" more than 200; he finally completed the "Genealogie" with some 70 illustrations. As an example of his decorative work may be mentioned the adornments, which are full of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> power, in the so-called "Damenhof" of the house of the Fugger <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. Under the influence of Italian art Burckmair modified the old realistic method of treating a subject, gradually replaced <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> in his work by that of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, substituted colour for gold in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and developed the use of landscape as a background.
