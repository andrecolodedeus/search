<h1>Hans Memling</h1>  

<p>Flemish <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. about 1430-35; d. at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> 11 August, 1494. This date was discovered in 1889 by P&egrave;re Henri Dusart in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, which adds that this <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, "the best in Christendom", was born at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (<em>oriundus Moguntiaco</em>), and that he was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Gilles. This valuable text destroys the celebrated legend of Memling, which relates that this great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, a soldier of Charles the Bold, was wounded at the battle of Granson, and was cared for at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. John. Through gratitude the injured soldier <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the marvellous pictures still to be seen there. Here in an "Adoration of the Magi" is seen his own portrait, wan and <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a>, wearing an invalid's cap. It was said at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> that he desired to be buried in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which held so many of his masterpieces, but another tradition relates that he died in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Miraflores near <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, where a picture ascribed to him is found. These two accounts of a pleasing hagiographical tint are therefore mere fables, evidently the tales of <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristans</a>, inspired by the pictures which they endeavoured to explain. They did not arise until the middle of the eighteenth century (cf. Descamps, "Vies des peintres Flamands", 1758, I, 12). On the other hand, the researches of Mr. James Weale show Memling under quite a different aspect. The wretched and pitiable soldier of Charles the Bold received by charity into a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> becomes in reality an important burgher of that prosperous city. If he had no official station at the court, it was because circumstances no longer permitted; he had nevertheless <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of his own, being in 1480 the owner of three houses, one of them "a large stone house" (<em>domus magna lapidea</em>), and figuring on the fiscal registers among the two hundred and forty-seven highest taxed citizens. At this time he married Anne de Valken&aelig;re (d. 1487), by whom he had three sons, Jean, Cornelius, and Nicholas. With a studio filled with pupils, he received commissions from the chief citizens of the town, such as Moreel and Floreins, and his fame reached beyond <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The "Anonyme" of Morelli, who wrote in 1521, seems to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> but two <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>; every picture of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, which he does not attribute to <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> he attributes to Memling.

<p>The remainder of Memling's history is that of his works. The first certain date is 1467. In that year the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> executed the portrait, now at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, of the Italian medallist Nicolo Spinelli, then in the service of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. The following year he executed the triptych of the Donne <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, now at Chatsworth in the collection of the Duke of Devonshire. In fact Sir John must have formed part of the escort which accompanied Margaret of York at the time of her marriage with Charles the Bold. The following chronological list constitutes almost all our information: 1478, retable executed for the illuminator Guillaume Vrelant, now at the Academy of Turin; 1479, triptych of the "Adoration of the Magi", executed for Jean Floreins; triptych of the "Mystical Marriage of St. Catherine", with the "Life" of the two Saint Johns, both in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. John at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; 1480, retable for Peter Bultinc, now at the old Pinacothek of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>; triptych of the Grocer's Guild, a lost picture; portraits of Guillaume Moreel and his wife (Museum of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>), and of their daughter Marie Moreel (the Sibyl Sambeth) in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. John at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; 1484, triptych of the Moreel <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at the Academy of Bruges; 1487, <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> of Martin van Nieuenhove, at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. John at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; portrait of a man in the Uffizi Museum, Florence; 1489, recovery of the shrine of <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a>, and placing of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in this shrine; 1491, polyptych of the "Cathedral of Lubeck". By adding to these works several other pictures (the Louvre possesses the greatest number) we have a total of twenty exquisite <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> constituting the whole of Memling's authentic work. Some critics, like K&auml;mmerer (Memling, 1899) have sought, without good reason, to augment this catalogue by adding to it other works by analogy. Another <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, that of W&uuml;rzbach, refuses to admit that all the works cited above are the works of a single author. They withdraw from Memling, the pictures of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>; the "Reliquary of <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a>"; the polyptychs of Lubeck and Dantzig, allowing him almost nothing except the portraits and pictures of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. John, the Triptych of Chatsworth, and two or three others closely related. Such a discussion cannot be entered into here, but even if Memling were the author of only the few pictures in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, none the less is he one of the most delightful geniuses of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and the keenest poet of the whole <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>Though he accomplished nothing comparable to <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eyck's</a> great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, the retable of the "Mystic Lamb", there is in his work a rarer, nobler, and more touching quality. The general characteristics of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> are an unsurpassed technical perfection, a realism, a rigour in the study and imitation of facts, such as render it impossible to say whether this perfection is more the condition or the effect. As a craftsman Memling is inferior to none of his <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> predecessors or imitators; he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paints</a> fabrics, velvets, flesh tints like <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> himself. In sentiment he is far superior, or rather dwells in a finer atmosphere, for the price of the uncompromising realism of the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> is often ugliness and vulgarity. In some works of <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Jan van Eyck</a>, as the "van der P&aelig;le Virgin" at the Academy of Bruges, the mediocrity of the types, the absence of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and taste, in a word the flatness, reach a painful degree. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the subsequent works, such as the celebrated "Nativity" of van der Goes in the Uffizi of Florence, in which the power of the "study" is only equalled by the insignificance or the triviality of its taste, and of those of the entire <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> from Petrus Christus and the Master of Fl&eacute;malle to the pretentious Thierry Bouts and the early works of G&eacute;rard David. All these works are strong in execution but weak in feeling. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Roger Van der Weyden</a> attempted to introduce passion into this realism, but his painful intensity most frequently results in a convulsive, distorted, affected style. Emotionalism runs riot with him, producing the effect of nervous strain or disease. In the midst of this powerful but inartistic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> the work of Memling astonishes by its subtle grace and refinement. In execution equal to anyone of his contemporaries, he transfigured all that he touched. Through all his portraits shines the radiance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> within. Compare, for example, the St. William of the Moreel triptych, in his black armour, that wonderful type of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> and soldier <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, with the awkward <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> of the "van der P&aelig;le Virgin", that soldier so ill at ease in his role of saint, and measure the difference between the crudeness of <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eyck</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> insight of Memling. This gift has made Memling the only <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to depict <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. He bestowed on her the same external luxury of draperies and attire, the same mantles, the same furs, the same wide skirts in majestic folds, with which the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in general loves to adorn her; but beneath this beautiful attire the Virgins of <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eyck</a> remain bourgeoises while those of Memling are young queens. His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are princesses. He endows them with slender figures, white and graceful necks, sweet and long profiles, long drooping eyelashes, pure brows and clear <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, with that immaterial something which tolerates in its vicinity only virginal dreams and chaste thoughts. Whatsoever is too worldly in their grace he corrects by an ideal but natural atmosphere, by the familiar and serene charm of his landscapes. A delicate symmetry lends a mysterious rhythm to these peaceful compositions and dominates them with the harmony of unheard music. <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a> lute players with blue and rose-coloured wings seem the expression of this unuttered song, the personified voice of the choir. Grace of figures, nobility and richness of decoration, serenity of landscapes, balancing of groups, melody of colours, lines, and sentiment all unite to produce a masterpiece of mystical poetry, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> romance, and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> beauty.

<p>But all these things, it must be repeated, are almost inexplicable in the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, at once the most natural and the most commonplace. These characteristics have their origin elsewhere, and the very legend concerning Memling, the story of a man coming as a stranger to art by a special vocation, is an unhistorical attempt to account for this singularity. Mr. James Weale had already conjectured that Memling's name contained the key to the enigma and concealed the clue to the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> origin; he thought that it was according to a frequent custom of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the name of a country. As a matter of fact there was a borough called Memelynck near Alkmaar in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and in the neighbourhood of Aschaffenburg in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> there was another called Mumling or Momling. For a time it was difficult to decide which of these two was the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> birthplace, but P&egrave;re Dusart's discovery has definitely cut short all uncertainty. The solution of the problem is that Memling was a German from <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, as is shown by his exclusively German <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a>, Hans. Before taking up his residence at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> he studied art at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, for northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the home and fatherland of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> and <a href="../cathen/07064a.htm">Guicciardini</a> relate that Memling was the pupil of <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Roger Van der Weyden</a>, but the only work of Memling's with a trace of Roger's influence is after a Pieta, in a church of Cologne. His "Reliquary of <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a>" again proves that he lived a long time in that city; the views of Basle and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are fancifully depicted, whereas in those of Cologne the slightest details of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> then in course of construction, the steeples of the churches of St. Martin and <a href="../cathen/11447a.htm">St. Pantaleon</a> are reproduced with a fidelity which shows that the author had grown up in the familiar shadow of these monuments. Memling's whole work breathes a spirit of poetry rarely found in the fifteenth century save in a few <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>. His favourite themes are the devotions <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, the city of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and of the Eleven Thousand Virgins. The mystical peace and beauty which surrounds his figures, those calm brows and clear <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> are not met with prior to him save in certain works of the Rhenish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> such as the "Adoration of the Magi" of the great Stephen Lochner or in his "Virgin of the rosebush". This alliance of German spirituality with <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> technic, this infusion of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, of the spiritual, the immaterial, into the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> best able to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the real, constituted the genius and the r&ocirc;le of Memling. Through him the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was rescued from the shallow <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> where for fifty years it had grown barren. Memling's influence was as great as it was beneficial. When we compare the early works of G&eacute;rard David, so harsh and brutal, such as the "Justice of Otto" and the "Marriage of Cana" of the Louvre, with those which were later executed under Memling's influence, we can estimate the service which the stranger, the "duitscher Hans", rendered to the country of his adoption. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he owes to it a practical skill which he would not otherwise have had but in return he brought it the spirit which revivified it. The works of the next generation show this more clearly; the "Mystical Marriage" of the Museum of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and the "Deposition" of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> by <a href="../cathen/10037c.htm">Quentin Metzys</a>. And when we remember that of all the masters of his country it was <a href="../cathen/10037c.htm">Metzys</a> whom <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> esteemed most, we can understand the importance of the role played in the destinies of the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> by the young <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> from Aschaffenburg who taught it poetry and <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>.
