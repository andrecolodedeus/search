<h1>Harbor Grace</h1>  

<p>(Portus Grati&aelig;)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, erected in 1856. It comprises all the northern bays &mdash; Conception, Trinity, Bonavista, Notre Dame, and White Bays &mdash; together with that portion of the coast of Labrador over which the Government of Newfoundland exercises <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Engaged in the ministerial work of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are twenty-three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who minister to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of twenty-nine thousand (29,000), consisting chiefly of sparse congregations scattered over five hundred miles of coastline. There are within the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> boundaries forty-nine churches, eighty- five stations, five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, of which three are of the <a href="../cathen/12397a.htm">Order of the Presentation</a> and two of the Order of Mercy, and one hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, having an attendance of four thousand five hundred pupils. The towns of Harbor Grace and Carbonear have each an academy, and in some other of the more populous settlements there are superior or high schools. The system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is denominational, the annual legislative grand of $245,323 being divided <em>pro rata</em> among the several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> of the island. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> within the diocese there is in the city of St. John's the College of St. Bonaventure conducted by the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a>. The position which this seat of learning occupies with regard to the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body of the island is clearly laid down in a joint circular letter recently addressed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> to the reverend <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. "The <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>", the circular states, "is the center of our <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system. It belongs not to St. John's alone, but to the whole island. It is the nursery in which are trained the youths who are, in future years, to be the teachers of our boys all over the country. It is the lyceum in which is given the Higher Education which fits our young men for the learned professions." In 1893 the Legislature incorporated a Council of Higher Education with power to confer diplomas and scholarships, as the result of competitive examinations, upon candidates from any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> in the colony.

<p>Among the institutions that appertain to the internal (religious) life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the <a href="../cathen/12422b.htm">Priests' Eucharistic League</a>, the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Society of the Children of Mary, and the League of the Sacred Heart.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>Rev. John Dalton, a native of Thurles, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and for some years <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's Church, Carbonear, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Harbor Grace, 20 January, 1856, and on 12 May of the same year was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/10629b.htm">Rt. Rev. Dr. Mullock</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, St. John's. He died in May 1869, having ruled the diocese thirteen years. His episcopate was peaceful and full of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, the great achievement of his administration being the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception.

<p>Bishop Dalton was succeeded by Rt. Rev. Henry Carfagnini, an Italian friar of the Order of St. Francis. He had been previously president of St. Bonaventure's College, St. John's. Dr Carfagnini was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1870. He was a man of large conception, breadth of view, and bold initiative. During his ten years' administration he increased the number of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from six to fourteen, encouraged the erection of churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and completed and embellished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Harbor Grace. His episcopate was, however, thick sown with trials of the most painful character. He had to struggle with a spirit of insubordination and faction which threatened to result in an open <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In 1880 he was translated to the <a href="../cathen/06366c.htm">See of Gallipoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1904.

<p>Rev. Ronald MacDonald, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Pictou, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, was appointed third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Pictou, 21 August, 1881. A <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> result of his rule was the restoration of peace to the diocese which had been torn by conflicting factions. His twenty-five years' episcopate was a period of great activity, and full of enterprise for the cause of religion. The rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Harbor Grace, destroyed by fire in 1889, was one of the great works of his administration. In 1906 the venerable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was, by reason of a protracted illness, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire from the scene of his active labours, and in June of the same year he published his farewell pastoral, announcing the acceptance by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> of his resignation. Before severing connection with the diocese he was made titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06654a.htm">Gortyna</a>.

<p>The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rt. Rev. John March, D.D., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 4 November, 1906. He is a native of Northern Bay, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, where he was born on 13 July, 1863. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 16 March, 1889, in the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, of which institution he is a graduate. Returning to Newfoundland he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a position he continued to occupy until his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>. He possesses unusual executive ability and is fully cognizant of the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His first important move in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was the inauguration, in 1907, of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students' fund.
