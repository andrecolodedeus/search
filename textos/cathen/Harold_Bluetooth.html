<h1>Harold Bluetooth</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>LAATAND</font>)

<p>Born 911; died 1 November, 985 or 986. He was the son of King Gorm the Old of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and of Thyra, daughter of a noblemen of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a> (Sunderjylland) who is supposed to have been kindly disposed towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. His mother must have implanted in the child's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the first germs of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, a devout servant of Wotan, did his utmost to destroy. The latter's invasion of Friesland in 934 involved him in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the German King, Henry I. Having been vanquished, he was forced to restore the churches which he had demolished as well as to grant toleration to his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects, and he died one year later, bequeathing his throne to Harold. Bishop Unni of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, accompanied by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the Abbey of Corvey, preached the gospel in Jutland (Jylland) and the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> isles, and soon won the confidence of the young ruler, although he did not succeed in persuading him to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Harold sought to shut the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> out of his kingdom by strengthening the "Danawirk"&mdash;a series of ramparts and fortifications that existed until the latter half of the nineteenth century; moreover, as absolute quiet prevailed throughout the interior, he was even able to turn his thoughts to foreign enterprises. Again and again he came to the help of Richard the Fearless of Normandy (in the years 945 and 963), while his son conquered Semland and, after the assassination of King Harold Graafeld of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, he also managed to force the people of that country into temporary subjection to himself. Meanwhile the new religion had become more and more deeply rooted among the Danes. Even a few members of the nobility (such as Frode, Viceroy of Jutland) embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and soon <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> were established (Schleswig, <a href="../cathen/16070b.htm">Ribe</a>, Aarhus). However the prominent part the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> had in these achievements as well as the lofty <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Roman Empire then prevailing led <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, the Great, to require Harold to recognize him as "advocatus", or lord protector of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> church, and even as "Lord Paramount". It is easy to understand why the indignant king of the Danes replied to this demand with a declaration of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and why the "emperor" sought to force his "vassal" into subjection. The devastating expeditions, which were pushed as far as the L&#255;mfjord, enabled the emperor to beat down all opposition (972), and to compel Harold not only to conclude peace but to accept <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Henceforth <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> steadily lost ground. The Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/16064d.htm">Odense</a> was established at F&uuml;nen (Fyen) in 980; the sacrificial grove at Lethra (on Zealand), which, until then, had been from time to time the scene of many human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, was deserted. King Harold removed his royal residence to Roeskilde and erected there a wooden church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. Later (in the eleventh century) it was replaced by a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> which in turn was soon torn down. Since about the year 1200 its site has been occupied by the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (dedicated to St. Lucius), the burial place of the kings of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> houses of worship were also built in many other places during Harold's reign; in these German and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> preached the gospel of the crucified and risen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Harold professed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at that time: it is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he contributed to its spread. But his moral conduct in many respects distinctly violated the Divine commandments. Consequently many people looked on the plots that were directed against the sovereignty and life of the ageing prince by his own son (Svend) as a punishment from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Although <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the latter joined forces with Palnatoke, the most powerful chieftain on F&uuml;nen, who was leader of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> party. The fortunes of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> varied for a time, but finally Harold was slain on 1 November, 985 or 986. His remains were buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Roeskilde, where his bones are still preserved, walled up in one of the pillars of the choir.
