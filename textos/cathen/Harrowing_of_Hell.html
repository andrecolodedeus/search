<h1>Harrowing of Hell</h1>  

<p>This is the Old English and Middle English term for the triumphant descent of Christ into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a> (or Hades) between the time of His Crucifixion and His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, when, according to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, He brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> held captive there since the beginning of the world. According to the "New English Dictionary" the word <em>Harrowing</em> in the above connection first occurs in <a href="../cathen/01171b.htm">Aelfric's</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, about A.D. 1000; but, long before this, the descent into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a> had been related in the Old English poems connected with the name of Caedmon and <a href="../cathen/04581d.htm">Cynewulf</a>. Writers of Old English prose <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> and lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> continually employ the subject, but it is in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a> that it is most fully found, both in prose and verse, and particularly in the drama. Art and literature all through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had from early times embodied in many forms the Descent into Hell, and specimens plays upon this theme in various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> literatures still exist, but it is in Middle English dramatic literature that we find the fullest and most dramatic development of the subject. The earliest specimen extant of the English religious drama is upon the Harrowing of Hell, and the four great cycles of English mystery plays each devote to it a separate scene. It is found also in the ancient Cornish plays. These <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> versions of the story, while ultimately based upon the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the Fathers, have yet, in their details, been found to proceed from the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/01111b.htm">Gospel of Nicodemus</a>, the literary form of a part of which is said to date back to the second of third century. In its Latin form this "gospel" was known in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from a very early time; <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and other Old English writers are said to show intimate acquaintance with it. English translations were made of it in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and in the long Middle English poem known as "Cursor Mundi" a paraphrase of it is found.
