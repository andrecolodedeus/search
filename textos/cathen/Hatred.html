<h1>Hatred</h1>  

<p><em>Hatred</em> in general is a vehement aversion entertained by one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for another, or for something more or less identified with that other. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> commonly mention two distinct species of this <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passion</a>. <ul> <li>One (<em>odium abominationis</em>, or loathing) is that in which the intense dislike is concentrated primarily on the qualities or attributes of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and only secondarily, and as it were derivatively, upon the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> himself. <li>The second sort (<em>odium inimicitiae</em>, or hostility) aims directly at the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, indulges a propensity to see what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and unlovable in him, feels a fierce satisfaction at anything tending to his discredit, and is keenly desirous that his lot may be an unmixedly hard one, either in general or in this or that specified way. </ul>

<p>This second kind of hatred, as involving a very direct and absolute violation of the precept of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and may be grievously so. The first-named species of hatred, in so far as it implies the reprobation of what is actually <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and may even represent a virtuous temper of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In other words, not only may I, but I even ought to, hate what is contrary to the moral law. Furthermore one may without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> go so far in the detestation of wrongdoing as to wish that which for its perpetrator is a very well-defined <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, yet under another aspect is a much more signal good. For instance, it would be lawful to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the death of a perniciously active heresiarch with a view to putting a stop to his ravages among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. Of course, it is clear that this apparent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> must not be an excuse for catering to personal spite or party rancour. Still, even when the motive of one's aversion is not impersonal, when, namely, it arises from the damage we may have sustained at the hands of others, we are not guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unless besides feeling indignation we yield to an aversion unwarranted by the by the hurt we have suffered. This aversion may be grievously or venially <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in proportion to its excess over that which the injury would justify.

<p>When by any conceivable stretch of human wickedness <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the object of hatred the guilt is appallingly special. If it be that kind of enmity (<em>odium inimicitiae</em>) which prompts the sinner to loathe <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself, to regret the Divine perfections precisely in so far as they belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the offence committed obtains the undisputed primacy in all the miserable <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In fact, such an attitude of mind is fairly and adequately described as diabolical; the human will detaches itself immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it does so only mediately and by consequence, that is, because of its inordinate use of some creature it is averted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To be sure, according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/3024.htm#article12">II-II:24:12</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> carries with it the loss of the habit of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">supernatural charity</a>, and implies so to speak a sort of virtual and interpretive hatred of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which, however, is not a separate specific malice to be referred to in <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confession</a>, but only a circumstance predicable of every grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
