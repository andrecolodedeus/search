<h2 id="section1">Edmund Hay</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and envoy to <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, b. 1540?; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 Nov., 1591. he was the son of Peter Hay of Megginch (castle still standing), the bailie of Errol, and related to the earl of that title. In 1562 (being already a B. D., probably of <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">Paris University</a>), he was selected to accompany Father Nicolas de Gouda (Floris), S.J., on his mission (June to September, 1562) from <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> to <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, then lately returned to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, Hay practically took charge of the mission, and conducted de Gouda amid many dangers to the queen's presence in a small room at <a href="../cathen/07423a.htm">Holyrood</a>, while the majority of the court were hearing a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> sermon; and he acted as interpreter during the important meeting, a full account of which will be found in de Gouda's report (Pollen, "Papal Negotiations", 113-161). Before they returned to the continent, Hay had persuaded a small band of young men to accompany him and to offer themselves to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. They comprised William Crichton, <a href="../cathen/01041b.htm">Robert Abercromby</a> (the future <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Queen Anne of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>), James Tyrie, James Gordon, and two others, all of whom did splendid service for their country in later years. Hay made his studies at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with rapidity and distinction. Sent to Innsbruck in 1564, he became confessor to the archduchesses of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and gained such favour that he was with difficulty removed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to become <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> college. He was already regarded as the probable head of the Scottish mission, and was commissioned to report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the varying fortunes of that country and its queen. In 1566, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> resolved to send Bishop, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, Laureo to Mary as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, and Hay was to accompany him. Hay started first (6 November) with the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> envoy Du Croc to see what could be done. Their object was to induce the queen to break with Murray, Lethington, and the other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, whose conduct in the violent scenes that accompanied the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Rizzio showed that they were not only faithless, but capable of appalling crime.

<p>On 14 January, 1567, the momentous interview took place. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereign of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> was receiving the last envoys from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Holyrood. If they had the inspiration to say exactly the right thing, and to urge it with sufficient skill, her whole future might have changed. Unfortunately, Laureo had ordered Hay to ask for the execution of the treacherous <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and this was demanding more than Mary was at all likely to grant. She answered that "she could not stain her hands with her subjects' blood". Before the envoys could return, the queen's refusal became relatively unimportant in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Darnley (10 February): a crime carried out with the connivance, if not the full consent, of that party in Mary's council from whose influence Father Hay had wished her to free herself. He was in Edinburgh at the time, and his reports, being those of a friendly, well-informed witness, cannot but be considered of the greatest importance in regard to Mary's guilt or innocence. Like other representative <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who were at that moment in touch with the circumstances of the case, he took a view adverse to Mary, and afterwards significantly described her as "peccatrix". Back in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 15 March, 1567, Hay was soon appointed <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, till 6 September, 1574, during the difficult years that covered the conflict between the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> and Father <a href="../cathen/09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a>. He was next <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, till 1581. He then returned again to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and filled the responsible post of consultor to the Province. In 1585, he was sent back the third time to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> with Father James Gordon, but was forced to return after two of three years, so harsh was the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He was once more placed in high office, called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and chosen "assistant" for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but his health was undermined by the severity of his missionary life, and he soon died.
<h2 id="section2">John Hay</h2>

<p>Kinsman and contemporary of Edmund, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Hay of Dalgetti; b., 1546; d. at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, 1608; a well-known scholar, professor, and writer. When a student he fell into consumption and was spitting blood. While going to consult a doctor in <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, in 1576, he found that a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (? Ambrose, Pape of Wittenberg), was challenging <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to disputation and that no one would appear against him. The Scot promptly entered the lists and soon defeated his adversary. He then returned to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for a while, and was completely restored by his native air. He was afterwards stationed at Tournon, where he carried on long and vigorous polemics against the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, especially with Jean de Serres, and in later life he published Latin translations of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> letters from the missions.
