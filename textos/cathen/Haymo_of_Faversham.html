<h1>Haymo of Faversham</h1>  

<p>English <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and schoolman, b. at <a href="../cathen/06019c.htm">Faversham</a>, Kent; d. at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, Itlay, in 1243, according to the most probable opinion; <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> gives 1244. He had already acquired fame as a lecturer in the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> and also as a preacher when he entered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of the Friars Minor</a>, probably in 1224 or 1225. Shortly after this he was appointed custos at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in which capacity he seems to have attended the general chapter of the order at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> in 1230, and was one of the deputies sent by the chapter to <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> to petition for an explanation of certain points in the rule about which there had arisen some discussion in the order. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> replied with the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quo elongati" of 28 September, 1230. After this chapter Haymo probably came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, for from a mention of him in the "Patent Rolls Henrici III" he seems to have been at Oxford in 1232, probably as a lecturer in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there. In 1233 he was one of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> sent by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to Constantinople to negotiate for the reunion of the Latin and Greek Churches. He led a peculiarly active life, for during these years he not only lectured at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, but also at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, Bologna, and Padua. He was, moreover, employed by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in revising the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and the edition published in 1241 of this <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (which afterwards was ordered to be used in all the Roman churches and eventually, with some modification, became the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) was chiefly the work of Haymo (cf. trans. of Batiffol, "Hist. of the Roman Breviary", p. 213). In 1239 he took part in the general chapter of the order held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Brother Elias was deposed from the office of general. From <a href="../cathen/05269b.htm">Eccleston's</a> account of this chapter it appears that Haymo was one of the chief spokesmen against Elias. He also brought about the degradation of Gregory of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, a lieutenant of Elias and a nephew of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After the deposition of Elias, Albert of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, Provincial of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was elected general, and Haymo succeeded him in the English provincialate. Albert, however died during the first year of his generalate, and Haymo was then elected to the supreme office in the order. According to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, Haymo was elected general in 1239, but this is an evident <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. <a href="../cathen/05269b.htm">Eccleston</a> expressly says that Haymo, while Provincial of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, gave the habit of the order to Ralph of Maidstone, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>; but Ralph only resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> on December 17, 1239; Haymo, therefore, could not have been elected general of the order until 1240.

<p>Haymo at once set about rectifying the disorders caused among the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> by Elias. The latter had increased the number of provinces in the order to seventy-two, "after the manner of the seventy-two disciples", says <a href="../cathen/05269b.htm">Eccleston</a>, and because he wished to rival the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who had divided their order into twelve provinces in honor of the twelve Apostles. Haymo reduced the number of provinces. As Elias had found his chief supporters amongst the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, whom he had attached to his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by promoting them to high places, Haymo decreed that in future no <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> should be appointed superior except when there were no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to fill the office. He also defined the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of superiors, and set their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> within definite bounds. Although very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the poverty of the rule, he yet was aware of the disadvantages of depending too much on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and preferred that the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> should live by their own labours; hence, when Provincial of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he obtained in several places larger grounds for the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, that they might cultivate the land and so supply themselves with food, in order that they might not have to beg. On his death-bed, says <a href="../cathen/05269b.htm">Eccleston</a>, he was visited by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> was at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> only from 25 June til the middle of October, 1243, and during the whole of 1244 was resident at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Haymo's epitaph reveals the repudiation in which he was held. It runs:

<blockquote><p>Hic jacet Anglorum summum decus, Haymo, Minorum,<br>Vivendo frater, hosque regendo pater:<br>Eximius lector, generalis in ordine rector.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Here lies Haymo, highest glory of the English; in his living a brother [friar] of the Minors, in ruling them a father; an eminent lecturer, and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> general in his order." As a schoolman he was styled, in the fashion of the time,Speculum honestatis. Besides his lectures on the Sentences he left a treatise on the ceremonies of the Mass and a book of sermons.
