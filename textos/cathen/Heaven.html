<h2 id="i">Name and place of heaven</h2>
<h3>The name of Heaven</h3>

<p>Heaven (Anglo-Saxon <em>heofon</em>, O.S. <em>hevan</em> and <em>himil</em>, originally <em>himin</em>) corresponds to the Gothic <em>himin-s</em>. Both <em>heaven</em> and <em>himil</em> are formed from <em>himin</em> by a regular change of consonants: <em>heaven</em>, by changing <em>m</em> before <em>n</em> into <em>v</em>; and <em>himil</em>, by changing <em>n</em> of the unaccented ending into <em>l</em>. Some derive <em>heaven</em> from the root <em>ham</em>, "to cover" (cf. the Gothic <em>ham-&ocirc;n</em> and the German <em>Hem-d</em>). According to this derivation heaven would be conceived as the roof of the world. Others trace a connection between <em>himin</em> (heaven) and <em>home</em>; according to this view, which seems to be the more probable, heaven would be the abode of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>. The Latin <em>coelum</em> (<em>koilon</em>, a vault) is derived by many from the root of <em>celare</em> "to cover, to conceal" (<em>coelum</em>, "ceiling" "roof of the world"). Others, however think it is connected with the Germanic <em>himin</em>. The Greek <em>ouranos</em> is probably derived from the root <em>var</em>, which also connotes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of covering. The Hebrew name for heaven is thought to be derived from a word meaning "on high"; accordingly, heaven would designate the upper region of the world.

<p>In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a> the term <em>heaven</em> denotes, in the first place, the blue <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, or the region of the clouds that pass along the sky. <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs20">Genesis 1:20</a>, speaks of the <a href="../cathen/02576b.htm">birds</a> "under the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> of heaven". In other passages it denotes the region of the stars that shine in the sky. Furthermore heaven is spoken of as the dwelling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for, although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is omnipresent, He manifests Himself in a special manner in the light and grandeur of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>. Heaven also is the abode of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for they are constantly with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and see His face. With <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in heaven are likewise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs1">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs3">Matthew 5:3, 12</a>). In <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs8">Ephesians 4:8 sq.</a>, we are told that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> conducted to heaven the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> who had been in <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">limbo</a> (<em>limbus patrum</em>). Thus the term <em>heaven</em> has come to designate both the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and the abode of just in the next life. The present article treats as heaven in this sense only.

<p>In <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> it is called: <ul> <li>the kingdom of heaven (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs3">Matthew 5:3</a>), <li>the kingdom of God (<a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs46">Mark 9:46</a>), <li>the kingdom of the Father (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs43">Matthew 13:43</a>), <li>the kingdom of Christ (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs30">Luke 22:30</a>), <li>the house of the Father (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs2">John 14:2</a>), <li>city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/heb012.htm">Hebrews 12</a>), <li>the holy place (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs12">Hebrews 9:12</a>; <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">D.V.</a> <em>holies</em>), <li>paradise (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs4">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>), <li>life (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs14">Matthew 7:14</a>), <li>life everlasting (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs16">Matthew 19:16</a>), <li>the joy of the Lord (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs21">Matthew 25:21</a>), <li>crown of life (<a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs12">James 1:12</a>), <li>crown of justice (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs8">2 Timothy 4:8</a>), <li>crown of glory (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#vrs4">1 Peter 5:4</a>), <li>incorruptible crown (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs25">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>), <li>great reward (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs12">Matthew 5:12</a>), <li>inheritance of Christ (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs18">Ephesians 1:18</a>), <li>eternal inheritance (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs15">Hebrews 9:15</a>). </ul>
<h3>The location of Heaven</h3>

<p>Where is heaven, the dwelling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the blessed?

<p>Some are of opinion that heaven is everywhere, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is everywhere. According to this view the blessed can move about freely in every part of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and still remain with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and see everywhere. Everywhere, too, they remain with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (in His sacred Humanity) and with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For, according to the advocates of this opinion, the <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">spatial</a> distances of this world must no longer impede the mutual intercourse of blessed.

<p>In general, however, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> deem more appropriate that there should be a special and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> abode, in which the blessed have their peculiar home and where they usually abide, even though they be free to go about in this world. For the surroundings in the midst of which the blessed have their dwelling must be in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state; and the internal union of charity which joins them in affection must find its outward expression in community of habitation. At the end of the world, the earth together with the celestial bodies will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> transformed into a part of the dwelling-place of the blessed (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm">Revelation 21</a>). Hence there seems to be no sufficient reason for attributing a metaphorical sense to those numerous utterances of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> which suggest a definite dwelling-place of the blessed. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a>, therefore, generally hold that the heaven of the blessed is a special place with definite limits. Naturally, this place is held to exist, not within the earth, but, in accordance with the expressions of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, without and beyond its limits. All further details regarding its locality are quite uncertain. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has decided nothing on this subject.

<h2 id="ii">Existence of heaven</h2>

<p>There is a heaven, i.e., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will bestow <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and the richest <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> on all those who depart this life free from <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and personal mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and who are, consequently, in the state of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justice</a> and friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Concerning the purification of those <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> who depart in venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or who are still subject to temporal punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, see <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">PURGATORY</a>. On the lot of those who die free from personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but infected with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, see <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">LIMBO</a> (<em>limbus pervulorum</em>). On the immediate beginning of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> after death, or eventually, after the passage through <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, see <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">PARTICULAR JUDGMENT</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of heaven is, of course, denied by <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheists</a> of all centuries as well as by those <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> who teach that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> perishes with the body &mdash; in short, by all who deny the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But, for the rest, if we abstract from the specific <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of heaven, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has never met with any opposition worthy of note. Even mere <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> can <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of heaven or of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state of the just in the next life.



<p>We shall give a brief outline of the principal arguments. From these we shall, at the same time, see that the bliss of heaven is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and consists primarily in the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that heaven presupposes a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, in which every wish of the heart finds adequate satisfaction.

<ul><li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things for His objective <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Every creature was to manifest His Divine perfections by becoming a likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, each according to its capacity. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is capable of becoming in the greatest and most perfect manner a likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he knows and loves His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> perfections with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> analogous to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. Moreover, this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; for such is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> capability and his calling, because his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Lastly, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him is the noblest occupation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and consequently also its supreme <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and he will <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> attain it hereafter, unless, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he renders himself unworthy of so high a destiny.
<li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things for His formal <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shown Him by <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures. Irrational creatures cannot give formal <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly, but they should assist <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures in doing so. This they can do by manifesting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> perfections and by rendering other services; whilst <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures should, by their own personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, refer and direct all creatures to Him as their last end. Therefore every intelligent creature in general, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in particular, is destined to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for ever, though he may forfeit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.
<li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, must give <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> its due reward. But, as experience teaches, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> do not obtain a sufficient reward here; hence they will be recompensed hereafter, and the reward must be everlasting, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Nor can it be supposed that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the next life must <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> her continuance in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by a continued series of combats; for this would be repugnant to all the tendencies and desires of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.
<li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His wisdom, must set on the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> a sanction, sufficiently appropriate and efficacious. But, unless each man is rewarded according to the measure of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, such a sanction could not be said to exist. Mere infliction of punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would be insufficient. In any case, reward for good deeds is the best means of inspiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a> itself teaches us to reward <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in others whenever we can, and to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for a reward of our own good actions from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Ruler</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. That reward, not being given here, will be given hereafter.
<li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has implanted in the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> a love of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; consequently, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because of His wisdom, must by rewarding <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> establish perfect harmony between these two tendencies. But such a harmony is not established in this life; therefore it will be brought about in the next.
<li>Every man has an innate desire for perfect beatitude. Experience <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> this. The sight of the imperfect goods of earth naturally leads us to form the conception of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> so perfect as to satisfy all the desires of our heart. But we cannot conceive such a state without desiring it. Therefore we are destined for a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> that is perfect and, for that very reason, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and it will be ours, unless we forfeit it by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. A natural tendency without an object is incompatible both with <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. The arguments thus far advanced <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of heaven as a state of perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.
<li>We are born for higher things, for the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This earth can satisfy no man, least of all the wise. "Vanity of vanities", says the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> (<a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#vrs1">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a>); and St. Augustine exclaimed: "Thou hast made us for Thyself (O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>) and our heart is troubled till it rests in Thee."
<li>We are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for wisdom, for a possession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> perfect in its kind. Our <a href="../cathen/05748a.htm">mental faculties</a> and the aspirations of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this. But the scanty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that we can acquire on earth stands in no proportion to the capabilities of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. We shall possess <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in higher perfection hereafter.
<li><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made us for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, for a complete and final triumph over passion and for the perfect and secure possession of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Our natural aptitudes and desires bear witness to this. But this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> goal is not reached on earth, but in the next life.
<li>We are <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and friendship, for indissoluble union with our friends. At the grave of those we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our heart longs for a future reunion. This cry of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is no delusion. A joyful and everlasting reunion awaits the just man beyond the grave.
<li>It is the conviction of all peoples that there is a heaven in which the just will rejoice in the next life. But, in the fundamental questions of our being and our destiny, a conviction, so unanimous and universal, cannot be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Otherwise this world and the order of this world would remain an utter enigma to intelligent creatures, who ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at least the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means for reaching their appointed end.
<li>Very few deny the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of heaven; and these few are practically all <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">epicureans</a>. But surely it cannot be that all the rest have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a>, and an isolated class of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> such as these are not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> guides in the most fundamental questions of our being. For <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> cannot be the key to wisdom. </ul>

<p>Revelation also proclaims the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of heaven. This we have already seen in the preceding section from the many names by which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> designates heaven; and from the texts of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, still to be quoted on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and peculiar <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of heaven.

<h2 id="iii">Supernatural character of heaven and the beatific vision</h2>

<p>(1) In heaven the just will see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>, clearly and distinctly. Here on earth we have no immediate perception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we see Him but indirectly in the mirror of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>. We get our first and direct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from creatures, and then, by reasoning from these, we ascend to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the imperfect likeness which creatures bear to their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>. But in doing so we proceed to a large extent by way of negation, i.e., by removing from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Divine Being</a> the imperfections proper to creatures. In heaven, however, no creature will stand between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He himself will be the immediate object of its <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a>. <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> tell us that the blessed see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face. And because this <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> is immediate and direct, it is also exceedingly clear and distinct. <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a> assert that we perceive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly in this life, though our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him is vague and obscure; but a <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> of the Divine Essence, immediate yet vague and obscure, implies a contradiction. The blessed see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not merely according to the measure of His likeness imperfectly reflected in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, but they see Him as He is, after the manner of His own Being. That the blessed see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, expressly <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (1336):<blockquote><p>We <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">define</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in heaven have seen and do see the Divine Essence by direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> and face to face [<em>visione intuitiv&acirc; et etiam faciali</em>], in such wise that nothing <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> intervenes as an object of <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a>, but the Divine Essence presents itself to their immediate gaze, unveiled, clearly and openly; moreover, that in this <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> they enjoy the Divine Essence, and that, in virtue of this <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> and this enjoyment, they are truly blessed and possess <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, ed. 10, n. 530--old edition, n, 456; cf. nn. 693, 1084, 1458 old, nn. 588, 868).</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> argument is based especially on <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 13:8-13</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs10">Matthew 18:10</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs2">1 John 3:2</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs6">2 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>, etc.). The argument from <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> is carried out in detail by <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> ("De. theol. dogm.", I, i, VII, c. 7). Several Fathers, who seemingly contradict this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, in reality maintain it; they merely teach that the bodily eye cannot see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that the blessed do not fully comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with its natural powers in this life (cf. <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a>, "De Deo", l. II, c. 7, n. 17).

<p>(2) It is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, that it transcends the powers and claims of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as well as of men. The opposite <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards and Beguines</a> was condemned (1311) by the <a href="../cathen/15423a.htm">Council of Vienne</a> (Denz., n. 475 &#151; old, n. 403), and likewise a similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (Denz., n. 1003 &#151; old, n. 883). The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> expressly declared that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has been elevated by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end (Denz., n. 1786 &#151; old, n. 1635; cf. nn. 1808, 1671 &#151; old, nn. 1655, 1527). In this connection we must also mention the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a>, and in particular of <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, who held that an immediate but indeterminate perception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is essential to the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (Denz., nn. 1659, 1927 &#151; old, nn. 1516, 1772).

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> can also be shown from the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> (Denz., n. 1021 &#151; old, n. 901); for, if the preparation for that <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a> is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Even unaided <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> recognizes that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">immediate vision of God</a>, even if it be at all possible, can never be natural for a creature. For it is manifest that every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> first perceives its own self and creatures similar to itself by which it is surrounded, and from these it rises to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the source of their being and their last end. Hence its natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is necessarily mediate and analogous; since it forms its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and judgments about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after the imperfect likeness which its own self and its surroundings bear to Him. Such is the only means <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> offers for acquiring a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and more than this is not due to any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; consequently, the second and essentially higher way of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> vision can but be a gratuitous gift of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.

<p>These considerations <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>, not merely that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">immediate vision of God</a> exceeds the natural claims of all creatures in actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but they also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> against <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a>, Becaenus, and others (Recently also Morlias), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot create any spirit which would, by virtue of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, be entitled to the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> vision of the Divine Essence. Therefore, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> express it, no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> is of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>; however, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has given no decision on this matter. Cf. Palmieri, "De Deo creante et elevante" (Rome, 1878), thes. 39; Morlais, "Le Surnaturel absolu", in "Revue du Clerg&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ais", XXXI (1902), 464 sqq., and, for the opposite view, <a href="../cathen/02411b.htm">Bellamy</a>, "La question du Surnaturel absolu", ibid., XXXV (1903), 419 sqq. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> seems to teach (<a href="../summa/1012.htm#article1">I.12.1</a>) that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has a natural desire for the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Elsewhere, however, he frequently insists on the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of that vision (e.g. <a href="../summa/4009.htm#article2">III.9.2 ad 3um</a>). Hence in the former place he obviously supposes that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> knows from <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> both the possibility of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> and his destiny to enjoy it. On this supposition it is indeed quite natural for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have so strong a desire for that vision, that any inferior kind of beatitude can no longer duly satisfy him.

<p>(3) To enable it to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the blessed is supernaturally perfected by the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (<em>lumen gloriae</em>). This was defined by the <a href="../cathen/15423a.htm">Council of Vienne</a> in 1311 (Denz., n. 475; old, n. 403); and it is also evident from the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> transcends the natural powers of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; therefore, to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> stands in need of some <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> strength, not merely transient, but permanent as the vision itself. This permanent invigoration is called the "light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>", because it enables the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, just as material light enables our bodily eyes to see corporeal objects.

<p>On the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has decided nothing. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have elaborated various theories about it, which, however, need not be examined in detail. According to the view commonly and perhaps most reasonably held, the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> Divinely infused into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and similar to <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just (cf. <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, "De Deo uno", 3rd ed., Rome, 1883, thes. 16). It is controverted among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> whether or not a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> image, be it a <em>species expressa</em> or a species impressa, is required for the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. But by many this is regarded as largely a controversy about the appropriateness of the term, rather than about the matter itself. The more common and probably more correct view denies the presence of any image in the strict sense of the word, because no <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> image can represent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as He is (cf. <a href="../cathen/10094c.htm">Mazzella</a>, "De Deo creante", 3rd ed., Rome, 1892, disp. IV, a. 7, sec. 1). The <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> is obviously a created act inherent in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not, as a few of the older <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> thought, the uncreated act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> communicated to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For, "as seeing and knowing are immanent vital actions, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can see or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by its own activity only, and not through any activity exerted by some other <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Cf. Gutherlet, "Das lumen gloriae" in "Pastor bonus", XIV (1901), 297 sqq.

<p>(4) <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> distinguish the primary and the secondary object of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. The primary object is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself as He is. The blessed see the Divine Essence by direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>, and, because of the absolute simplicity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they necessarily see all His perfections and all the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the Trinity. Moreover, since they see that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can create countless imitations of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Essence</a>, the entire domain of possible creatures lies open to their view, though indeterminately and in general. For the actual <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are not necessarily an object of that <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision</a>, except in as afar as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pleases to manifest them. Therefore finite things are not necessarily seen by the blessed, even if they are an actual object of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will. Still less are they a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> object of vision as long as they are mere possible objects of the Divine will. Consequently the blessed have a distinct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of individual possible things only in so far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes to grant this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Thus, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so willed, a blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> might see the Divine Essence without seeing in it the possibility of any individual creature in particular. But in fact, there is always connected with the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of various things external to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">possible</a> as well as of the <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actual</a>. All these things, taken collectively, constitute the secondary object of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>.

<p>The blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees these secondary objects in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> either directly (<em>formaliter</em>), or in as far as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (<em>causaliter</em>). It sees in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly whatever the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> discloses to its immediate gaze without the aid of any <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> image (<em>species impressa</em>). In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in their cause, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sees all those things which it perceives with the aid of a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> image, a mode of perception granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a natural complement of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. The number of objects seen directly in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be increased unless the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> itself be intensified; but the number of things seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their cause may be greater of smaller, or it may very without any corresponding change in the vision itself.

<p>The secondary object of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> comprises everything the blessed may have a reasonable interest in knowing. It includes, in the first place, all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> while on earth. Moreover, the blessed see each other and rejoice in the company of those whom death separated from them. The veneration paid them on earth and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> addressed to them are also known to the blessed. All that we have said on the secondary object of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> is the common and reliable teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. In recent times (Holy Office, 14 Dec., 1887) <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> was condemned because he taught that the blessed do not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, but only His relations to creatures (Denz., 1928-1930 &#151; old, 1773-75). In the earlier ages we find <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> ("Moral.", l. XVIII, c. liv, n. 90, in P.L., LXXVI, XCIII) combating the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a few who maintained that the blessed to not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only a brilliant light streaming forth from Him. Also in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there are traces of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, "De Deo uno", 2nd ed., thes. 15, p. 192).

<p>(5) Although the blessed see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they do not comprehend Him, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolutely incomprehensible to every <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and He cannot grant to any creature the power of comprehending Him as He comprehends Himself. <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> rightly calls this a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ("De Deo", l. II, c. v, n. 6); for the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Council of the Lateran</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> enumerated incomprehensibility among the absolute <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a> (Denz., nn. 428, 1782 &#151; old nn. 355, 1631). The Fathers defend this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, who asserted that we comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fully even in this life. The blessed comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> neither intensively nor extensively &mdash; not intensively, because their vision has not that <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> clearness with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is knowable and with which He knows Himself, nor extensively, because their vision does not actually and clearly extend to everything that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sees in His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Essence</a>. For they cannot by a single act of their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> represent every possible creature individually, clearly, and distinctly, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does; such an act would be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> act is incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and finite <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. The blessed see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> in its entirety, but only with a limited clearness of vision (<em>Deum totum sed non totaliter</em>). They see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> in its entirety, because they see all the perfections of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all the Persons of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">the Trinity</a>; and yet their vision is limited, because it has neither the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> clearness that corresponds to the Divine perfections, nor does it extend to everything that actually is, or may still become, an object of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> free decrees. Hence it follows that one blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more perfectly than another, and that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> admits of various degrees.

<p>(6) The <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Of course <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the impossibility of such a vision. For why should <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, be unable to draw so near and adapt Himself so fully to our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may, as it were, directly feel Him and lay hold of Him and look on Him and become entirely immersed in Him? On the other hand, we cannot <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> absolutely that this is possible; for the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> lies beyond the natural destiny of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and it is so extraordinary a mode of perception that we cannot clearly understand either the fact or the manner of its possibility.

<p>(7) From what has been thus far said it is clear that there is a twofold beatitude: the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. As we have seen, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> entitled to beatitude, provided he does not forfeit it by his own fault. We have also seen that beatitude is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and that it consists in the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for creatures cannot truly satisfy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Again, as we have shown, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to possess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is entitled by <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is not an immediate vision, but an analogous perception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the mirror of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, still a very perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which really satisfies the heart. Hence the beatitude to which alone we have a natural claim consists in that perfect analogous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> corresponding to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. This natural beatitude is the lowest kind of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">felicity</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and wisdom, can grant to sinless man. But, instead of an analogous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Essence</a> He may grant to the blessed a direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> which includes all the excellence of natural beatitude and surpasses it beyond measure. It is this higher kind of beatitude that it has pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to grant us. And by granting it He not merely satisfies our natural desire for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> but He satisfies it in superabundance.

<h2 id="iv">Eternity of heaven and impeccability of the blessed</h2>

<p>It is a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the blessed is everlasting. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is clearly contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a> (see Section I); it is daily professed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> (<em>credo . . . vitam aeternam</em>), and it has been repeatedly <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (cf. Section III). Even <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as we have seen, can demonstrate it. And surely, if the blessed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> was ever to come to an end, this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> alone would prevent their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> from being perfect.

<p>In this matter <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; for in several passages of his works he seems to incline to the opinion that <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures never reach a permanent final state (<em>status termini</em>), but that they remain forever capable of falling away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and losing their beatitude and of always returning to Him again.

<p>The blessed are confirmed in good; they can no longer commit even the slightest venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; every wish of their heart is inspired by the purest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That is, beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. Moreover this impossibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> is physical. The blessed have no longer the power of choosing to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions; they cannot but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they are merely free to show that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by one good action in preference to another. But whilst the impeccability of the blessed appears to be unanimously held by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, there is a diversity of opinion as to its cause. According to some, its proximate cause consists in this that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolutely withholds from the blessed His co-operation to any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> does not, they argue, of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> exclude <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> directly and absolutely; because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may still displease the blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in various ways, e.g., by refusing a higher degree to beatitude, or by letting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loves die in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and sentencing them to eternal torment. Moreover, when great sufferings and arduous <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> accompany the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, as was the case in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on earth, then at least the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not directly and absolutely excluded.

<p>The ultimate cause of impeccability is the freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or the state of grace in which at his death <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> passes into the final state (<em>status termini</em>), i.e. into a state of unchangeable attitude of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and will. For it is quite in consonance with the nature of that state that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should offer only such co-operation as corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> chose for himself on earth. For this reason also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, although they do not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are still utterly incapable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> itself may be called a remote cause of impeccability; for by granting so wondrous a token of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be said to undertake the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of guarding from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> those whom He so highly favours, whether by refusing all co-operation to evil acts or in some other manner. Besides, even if the clear <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, most worthy of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, does not render the blessed physically unable, it certainly renders them less liable, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>Impeccability, as explained by the representatives of this opinion, is not, properly speaking, extrinsic, as is often wrongly asserted; but it is rather intrinsic, because it is strictly due to the final state of blessedness and especially to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. This is substantially the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, likewise of many others, especially in recent times. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, and with them the greater number of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, maintain that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> of its very <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> directly excludes the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For no creature can have a clear <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> view of the Supreme Good without being by that very fact alone irresistibly drawn to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it efficaciously and to fulfil for its sake even the most arduous <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> without the least repugnance. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has left this matter undecided. The present writer rather inclines to the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a> because of its bearing on the question of the liberty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">HELL</a> <em>under the heading</em> Impenitence of the Damned.)

<h2 id="v">Essential beatitude</h2>

<p>We distinguish objective and subjective beatitude. Objective beatitude is that good, the possession of which makes us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; subjective beatitude is the possession of that good. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of objective beatitude, or the essential object of beatitude is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. For the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> assures us also the possession of every other good we may desire; moreover, everything else is so immeasurably inferior to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that its possession can only be looked upon as something <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to beatitude. Finally, that all else is of minor importance for beatitude is evident from the fact that nothing save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is capable of satisfying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of subjective beatitude is the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it consists in the acts of vision, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The blessed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with a twofold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of complacency, by which they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake, and secondly with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> less properly so called, by which they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as the source of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> (<em>amor concupiscentiae</em>). In consonance with this twofold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the blessed have a twofold <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; firstly, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the strict sense of the word, by which they rejoice over the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> beatitude which they see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, precisely because it is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and secondly, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> springing from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in a wider sense, by which they rejoice in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because He is the source of their own supreme <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. These five acts constitute the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of (subjective) beatitude, or in more precise terms, its physical <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree.

<p>Here <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> go a step farther and inquire whether among those five acts of the blessed there is one act, or a combination of several acts, which constitutes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of beatitude in a stricter sense, i.e. its <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> in contradistinction to its physical <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. In general their answer is affirmative; but in assigning the <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> their opinions diverge. The present writer prefers the opinion of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, who holds that the <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> consists in the vision alone. For, as we have just seen, the acts of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are merely a kind of secondary attributes of the vision; and this remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> result directly from the vision, as the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> hold, or whether the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> by its very nature calls for confirmation in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> efficacious protection against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="vi">Accidental beatitude</h2>

<p>Besides the essential object of beatitude the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in heaven enjoy many <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> to beatitude. We shall mention only a few: <ul> <li>In heaven there is not the least pain or sadness; for every aspiration of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> must be finally realized. The will of the blessed is in perfect harmony with the Divine will; they feel displeasure at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men, but without experiencing any real pain. <li>They delight greatly in the company of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and in the reunion with so many who were dear to them on earth. <li>After the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the glorified body will be a special source of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the blessed. <li>They derive great pleasure from the contemplation of all those things, both <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and possible, which, as we have shown, they see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at least indirectly as in the cause. And, in particular, after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> the new heaven and the new earth will afford them manifold enjoyment. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">GENERAL JUDGMENT</a>.) <li>The blessed rejoice over <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that adorn their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and any <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> they may have also adds to their bliss. <li>Very special joys are granted to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">doctors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, a special <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of victories won in time of trial (<a href="../bible/rev007.htm#vrs11">Revelation 7:11 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs3">Daniel 12:3</a>; <a href="../bible/rev014.htm#vrs3">Revelation 14:3 sq.</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> speak of three particular crowns, aureolas, or glorioles, by which these three classes of blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidentally</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> beyond the rest. <em>Aureola</em> is a diminutive of <em>aurea</em>, i.e. <em>aurea corona</em> (golden crown). (Cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/5096.htm#article0">Supp:96</a>.) </ul>

<p>Since <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is metaphorically called a <a href="../cathen/09703a.htm">marriage</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> also speak of the bridal endowments of the blessed. They distinguish seven of these gifts, four of which belong to the glorified body &mdash; light, impassibility, agility, subtility (see <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">RESURRECTION</a>); and three to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> &mdash; vision, possession, enjoyment (<em>visio, comprehensio, fruitio</em>). Yet in the explanation given by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the three gifts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we find but little conformity. We may identify the gift of vision with the habit of the light of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the gift of possession with the habit of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in a wider sense which has found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the fulfilment of its desires, and the gift of enjoyment we may identify with the habit of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> properly so called (<em>halitus caritatis</em>) which rejoices to be with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in this view these three infused habits would he considered simply as ornaments to beautify the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/5095.htm#article0">Supp:95</a>)

<h2 id="vii">Attributes of beatitude</h2>

<p>There are various degrees of beatitude in heaven corresponding to the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>. This is a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, defined by the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (Denz., n. 693 &#151; old, n. 588). The <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> teaches this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in very many passages (e.g., wherever it speaks of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as a reward), and the Fathers defend it against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> attacks of <a href="../cathen/08530a.htm">Jovinian</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, according to <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs1">Matthew 20:1-16</a>, each labourer receives a penny; but by this comparison <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> merely teaches that, although the Gospel was preached to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> first, yet in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> there is no distinction between <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, and that no one will receive a greater reward merely because of being a son of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Judah</a>. The various degrees of beatitude are not limited to the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> blessings, but they are found first and foremost in the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> itself. For, as we have already pointed out, the vision, too, admits of degrees. These <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> degrees of beatitude are, as <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> rightly observes ("De beat.", d. xi, s. 3, n. 5), that threefold fruit <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> distinguishes when He says that the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a> bears fruit in some thirty, in some sixty, in some a hundredfold (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs23">Matthew 13:23</a>). And it is by a mere accommodation of the text that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/5096.htm#article0">Supp:96, aa. 2 sqq.</a>) and other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> apply this text to the different degrees in the <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> beatitude merited by married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of heaven is essentially unchangeable; still it admits of some <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> changes. Thus we may suppose that the blessed experience special <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> when they receive greater <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on earth. In particular, a certain growth in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by experience is not excluded; for instance, as <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> goes on, new free actions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the blessed, or personal observation and experience may throw a new light on things already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And after the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last judgment</a> <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accidental</a> beatitude will receive some increase from the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and from the sight of the new heaven and the earth.
