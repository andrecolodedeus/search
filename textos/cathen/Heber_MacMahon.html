<h1>Heber MacMahon</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> EMER or EVER).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and patriotic leader, born at Farney, County Monaghan, 1600; executed at Enniskillen in 1650; son of Turlogh MacMahon and his wife Eva O'Neill, and nephew of Sir Patrick MacArt MacMahon. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, having become impoverished by a <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">bill of attainder</a> confiscating the land of those who had struggled for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> liberty, withdrew to Killybegs, and Heber received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Donegal, some twenty miles away. He went to the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1617 and later to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where he studied under Hugh MacCaghwell, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1625, after which he returned to the <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Diocese of Clogher</a>. He laboured there for some years with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and fruit among his flock who had been despoiled of their lands, robbed of their churches, and forced to worship secretly in the mountains, and soon he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. On 10 Feb., 1642, he was nominated to the <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">See of Down and Connor</a> and was present at the Synod of Kells in that year. Before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, however, he was transferred to <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>, 2 June, 1643. When the struggle for freedom began in 1641 he became a steadfast adherent of <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill</a>, and energetically supported the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys, Scarampi in 1643 and <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a> in 1645, in opposition to Ormonde and the majority of the Supreme Council of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, whom he believed to be sacrificing the interests of religion for the sake of peace. In 1647 the opponents of <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a> endeavoured to get rid of MacMahon by sending him on a mission to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which, however, he refused to accept. In April, 1648, he condemned the truce with Inchiquin as inimical to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Finding his efforts fruitless he withdrew with <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill</a> to Ulster, whereupon they were proclaimed traitors to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by the Supreme Council. In 1649 he was captured by Sir Phelim O'Neill and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, but escaped shortly afterwards. In October, 1649, Ormonde and <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill</a> made peace, the better to resist the Cromwellian invasion. In March, 1650, MacMahon was chosen to lead the Ulster forces, O'Neill having died some months earlier. Encouraged by some early successes he risked a serious conflict with the English army under Sir Charles Coote at Scariffhollis, County Donegal, on 21 June, 1650, was defeated and captured two days later near Omagh, and though promised quarter was shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by Coote, despite the efforts made by Major-general King, governor of Enniskillen, to obtain a commutation of the death sentence. His head was stuck on a spike at Enniskillen Castle and his trunk buried by some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on Devenish Island, with the permission of Governor King.
