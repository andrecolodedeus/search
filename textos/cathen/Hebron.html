<h1>Hebron</h1>  

<p>(<em>hbrwn, chebr&oacute;n</em>)

<p>An ancient royal city of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, famous in biblical history, especially at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and under <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> &mdash; at present it is only a titular one &mdash; and was situated in Palestine Prima, with C&aelig;sarea as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. Hence the division of this article into two parts: (I) Biblical Epoch, (II) Christian Epoch.
<h2>Biblical epoch</h2>

<p>Hebron is one of the earliest towns mentioned in history. According to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (<a href="../bible/num013.htm#vrs23">Numbers 13:23</a>) it was founded seven years before Zoan or Tanis, the most ancient town in Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which means that it existed from the first half of the third millennium <font size=-2>B.C.</font> <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Bel. Jud., IV, ix, 7) says that in his time the town was already 2300 years old. It was originally called Kiriat Arba, or Kiriat- ha-Arba (D. V. Cariath-Arbe, <a href="../bible/gen023.htm#vrs2">Genesis 23:2</a>, <a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs27">35:27</a>; <a href="../bible/jos014.htm#vrs15">Joshua 14:15</a>, <a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs13">15:13</a>, <a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs54">15:54</a>, <a href="../bible/jos020.htm#vrs7">20:7</a>, <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs11">21:11</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs10">Judges 1:10</a>; <a href="../bible/neh011.htm#vrs25">Nehemiah 11:25</a>) from the name of Arba, "the greatest among the Enacims" (<a href="../bible/jos014.htm#vrs15">Joshua 14:15</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, taking the common name <em>ha-adam</em> in this last expression, i.e. the man, for the proper name <em>Adam,</em> translates as follows: "Adam the greatest among the Enacim was laid there"; whence it should not be inferred, as was the case with some ancient authors, that Hebron contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>. The explanation of the name <em>Kiriat-Arba</em> by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> shows all others to be merely fanciful. Such, for instance, is that of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (De locis et nominibus locorum Hebraicorum, s.v. Arbac, P.L., XXIII, 862; Ep. xlvi, P.L., XXII, 491; Ep. cviii, P.L. XXII, 886; Quest. in Gen., P.L., XXIII, 978) and of some Jewish commentators who take the word Arba to mean "four", and Kiriat-Arba to be the "town of the four", i.e. the four <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> buried in the cave of Machpelah: <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, to whom must be added, according to various opinions, either Adam, Caleb, Esau, or Joseph. According to de Saulcy (Voyage en Terre Sainte, I, 152) the name means "the town of the four quarters"; while it suits the modern town, this is not at all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the ancient one. The Bible, however, insists over and over again on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> origin of the name: "Cariath-Arbe the father of Enac, which is Hebron" (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs13">Joshua 15:13</a>; <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs11">21:11</a>). The name Hebron is also very ancient. It appears under the form <em>Cheburo</em> on <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monuments of the second milennium <font size=-2>B.C.</font> (Br&uuml;gsch, "Geog. Inschriften alt&#228;gypt. Denkm&#228;ler", II, 76).

<p>The earliest mention of Hebron in the Scriptures occurs (<a href="../bible/gen013.htm#vrs18">Genesis 13:18</a>) on the occasion of Abraham's coming to the vale of Mambre; and this last name is often given to Hebron (<a href="../bible/gen023.htm#vrs19">Genesis 23:19</a>, <a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs27">35:27</a>). On the death of Sara, his wife, the patriarch bought from Ephron the Hethite the cave of Machpelah to serve as a burying place for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (<a href="../bible/gen023.htm">Genesis 23</a>); Abraham himself was buried there (<a href="../bible/gen025.htm#vrs9">Genesis 25:9</a>), as were also Isaac (<a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs27">Genesis 35:27-29</a>) and Jacob (<a href="../bible/gen050.htm#vrs13">Genesis 50:13</a>). Hebron thus became the second homeland of Abraham, and the centre of attraction during the wanderings of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. Isaac and Jacob dwelt at Mambre, and it was from the "vale of Hebron" that Joseph was sent towards Sichem and Dothain to inquire after his brethren (<a href="../bible/gen037.htm#vrs14">Genesis 37:14, 17</a>). The Hebrew spies sent by Moses into <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> went as far as Hebron, and it was from the adjacent valley of Escol that they brought back a vine-branch with its cluster of grapes, and some pomegranates and figs (<a href="../bible/num013.htm#vrs23">Numbers 13:23-25</a>). When the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> invaded <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, Oham, King of Hebron, allied himself against them with four other <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> princes to besiege Gabaon. After <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> had defeated them, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>, he went on to attack Hebron, which he took, putting all its inhabitants to death (<a href="../bible/jos010.htm#vrs3">Joshua 10:3, 23-26, 36-37</a>; <a href="../bible/jos011.htm#vrs21">11:21</a>; <a href="../bible/jos012.htm#vrs10">12:10</a>). On the division of the Promised Land, Hebron fell to the tribe of Juda and was given to Caleb (<a href="../bible/jos014.htm#vrs13">Joshua 14:13, 14</a>; <a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs13">15:13, 54</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs20">Judges 1:20</a>). It soon afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">city of refuge</a>, falling to the lot of the children of Aaron (<a href="../bible/jos020.htm#vrs7">Joshua 20:7</a>, <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs11">21:11, 13</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch006.htm#vrs55">1 Chronicles 6:55, 57</a>). After the death of Saul on Mount Gelboe, <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> went to Hebron with his men, and occupied all the surrounding villages (<a href="../bible/2sa002.htm#vrs1">2 Samuel 2:1, 3</a>). He was there anointed King of Juda; made Hebron his capital, and reigned there seven years and a half (<a href="../bible/2sa002.htm#vrs11">2 Samuel 2:11</a>, <a href="../bible/2sa003.htm#vrs2">3:2, 5</a>; <a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#vrs5">5:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#vrs11">1 Kings 2:11</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch003.htm#vrs1">1 Chronicles 3:1, 4</a>; and <a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#vrs27">29:27</a>). Abner, the leader of Saul's army, came to Hebron to see <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, was well received by him, but was afterwards killed by Joab. The king wept over Abner, gave him burial, and composed a lament over him (<a href="../bible/2sa003.htm#vrs19">2 Samuel 3:19</a>-<a href="../bible/2sa004.htm#vrs1">4:1</a>). It was also to Hebron that Baana and Rechab, chiefs of the bands of Isboseth, brought the head of that son of Saul whom they had traitorously slain. <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> ordered the murderers to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; their hands and feet were cut off, and hanged up over the pool in Hebron (<a href="../bible/2sa004.htm#vrs2">2 Samuel 4:2-12</a>). Then all the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribes of Israel</a> came and made submission to <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#vrs1">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch011.htm#vrs1">1 Chronicles 11:1-3</a>). When <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a> revolted against his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who had then become King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, it was Hebron he made his headquarters (<a href="../bible/2sa015.htm#vrs7">2 Samuel 15:7-11</a>). The town was fortified by Roboam (<a href="../bible/2ch011.htm#vrs10">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>). Cariath-Arbe is also mentioned among the towns occupied by the children of Juda after the captivity (<a href="../bible/neh011.htm#vrs25">Nehemiah 11:25</a>). Under Syrian domination, it passed into the hands of the Idumeans; <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>, who drove them out, razed the fortifications of Chebron (<a href="../bible/1ma005.htm#vrs65">1 Maccabees 5:65</a>).


<h2>Christian epoch</h2>

<p>Some writers, following <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Papebroch, <a href="../cathen/04377a.htm">Cornelius a Lapide</a>, and Matth. Polus, have identified Hebron as the city of Juda where the Visitation took place, and where <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> was born. They hold that Hebron was the most important of the towns of Juda, since <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> belonged to Benjamin; and that, moreover, Hebron was the most important of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a> towns belonging to the sons of Caath, from whom came Zachary, father of the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Precursor</a>. However there is fairly strong local tradition in favour of identifying the "city of Juda" with Carem, the modern Ain-Karim (see <a href="../cathen/03345b.htm">C<font size=-2>AREM</font></a>; Heidet in Vig., "Dict. de la Bible", s.v. Carem; and Meistermann, "La partrie de S. Jean Baptiste"). At the time of the great Jewish rebellion, Simon ben Giora captured Hebron from the Romans; but the town was soon retaken, shortly before the siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, by Cerealis, one of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian's</a> generals, who ravaged it with fire and sword (Josephus, "Bel. Jud.", IV, ix, 7-9). It was with great difficulty that Hebron ever recovered. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Onomast., s.v. <em>&rsquo;Arb&oacute;</em>) tells us that in his day (fourth century) it was merely a large hamlet; but the neighbourhood has always been dear to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> alike (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "Vita Constantini", III, li, lii, in P.G. XX, 1112-1117; <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/2601.htm"><em>Church History</em></a>; <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/2602.htm"><em>Church History</em></a>). Even the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> held it dear by reason of its many Scriptural associations, especially the apparition of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to Abraham, and because it contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. This <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (loc. cit.; "Ant.", I, 14), by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Onomasticon, loc. cit.), by the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in 333, and by visitors of after-ages, as a sanctuary held in the highest reverence. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest in 637, Hebron, for all these reasons, was chosen as one of the four holy cities of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. Previously Khusrau (614), the Persian king, had spared it in deference to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of whom there were many in his army. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (loc. cit.) relate that Constantine ordered a church to be built at Mambre, with the object of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices that took place there every year during a semi-religious fair. But we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at what epoch a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was first built over the cave of Machpelah. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> took the town in 1100, and that the sanctuary became the church of Saint Abraham, also called the church of the Holy Cave (Sancta Caverna or Spelunca, <em>&rsquo;&aacute;gion spela&#238;on</em>). The town itself is often styled by the chroniclers of that period Castel Saint-Abraham, Pr&aelig;sidium or Castellum ad Sanctum Abraham. A <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> was installed to take charge of the basilica (de Rozi&#232;re, "Cartulaire du Saint-S&eacute;pulchre", 120, 142, etc., 171).

<p>A curious document relating to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a> and taken from a fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, is found in the "Recueil des historiens des croisades" (Hist. Occid., V, 302-316) under the heading: "Canonici Hebronensis tractatus de inventione sanctorum patriarcharum Abraham, Ysaac et Jacob" [see Riant, "Invention de la s&eacute;pulture des patriarches &hellip; &#224; H&eacute;bron, le 25 juin 1119", in "Archives de l'Orient latin", II (1883), 411-421; also "Acta SS.", Oct., IV, 683-691; and "Analecta Bollandiana", XX (1901), 464]. This story seems to be founded on fact; two <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> historians, who may have lived contemporaneously, mention such a discovery (Recueil des Hist. des Croisades, op. cit., p. 64).

<p>Its most interesting historical materials are: a description of the sanctuary existing on the site of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> before the coming of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>; the sending of an embassy from Constantinople to Palestine by Theodosius the Younger, about 415, to bring back the bodies of the three <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and the failure of this attempt; the existence of a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> at Hebron at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>; the spoliation of the sanctuary at Hebron between 1099 and 1102 by a Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, probably Pierre de Narbonne, transferred from the See of Alban to that of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a> between 1112 and 1119. A reference is made, at the year 1119, to Rainier, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Hebron, and to two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Odo and Arnulph, who gave the anonymous writer the facts he relates; mention is also made of Baudouin, seigneur of Saint-Abraham; Guermond, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (d. 1128); and a description occurs of the sepulchral <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> where the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> lay. In 1167 Hebron became a <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; its first titular was Rainaldus (1167-1170), nephew of the patriarch Foucher (<a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, "Families d'outremer", 794).

<p>A letter of <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 June, 1267, orders the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to supply the church of Hebron with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (Eubel, "Hierarchia Catholica", I, 283). After Geoffrey (Gaufridus), O.P., 1273-1283, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Hebron were merely titulars, and a great confusion existed in their list (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a>, "Oriens Christ.", III, 639-642, 1269-1270; <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>, "Series episc.", 435; Eubel, op. cit., I, 283, II, 180). Cardinal Mermillod was at one time Titular of Hebron. The titular at present is Monsignor Petkoff, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in Thrace, who resides at <a href="../cathen/01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>. As a residential see, Hebron enjoyed a very brief existence. However it survived the triumph of Saladin in 1187, and the march of the Kharesmian hordes in 1244. Saladin, after the victory at Hattin (15 July, 1187), and that at <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a> (5 September), hastened, before marching on <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to occupy Hebron, and to associate the sanctuary of Abraham with the worship of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. The Kharesmians destroyed the town, but did not touch the sanctuary (Riant, "Archives", II, 420-421).

<p>In spite of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> fanaticism, which since the fourteenth century had forbidden a non-Mussulman to enter the hallowed place (Isaac Chelo, 1334, Les chemins de J&eacute;rusalem, in Carmoly, "Itin&eacute;raires", 243), the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a>, after the departure of the Latins, retained for a time a residing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Hebron. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (III, 641-642) mentions one of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Joannikios, whose name appears with that of Christodoulos of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> in the Acts of the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1672 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXXIV B, 1771) under the title of <em>Ioannik&#237;ou to&#251; theophilest&aacute;tou &rsquo;archiepisk&oacute;pou to&#251; &lsquo;ag&#237;on spela&#237;on</em> (Joannikios, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of the holy Cave). Among the other signatories (ibid., 1174) were two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the same church, George and Isas, both of whom describe themselves as <em>&lsquo;iere&#249;s to&#251; &lsquo;ag&#237;ou spela&#237;ou</em> (<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and servant of the holy Cave). This Greek see did not last long; and it is not mentioned in the notice of Chrysanthus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 1707-1731. In 1834, after defeating, near the Pools of Solomon, the inhabitants of Hebron who had risen against his authority, Ibrahim Pasha took their town by assault.

<p>Hebron is today one of the principal towns of Palestine. It is about twenty-four miles to the south of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, is the residence of a kaimakam, and has a population of 20,000, of whom 2000 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of German, Spanish, or Portuguese origin; the remainder are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> fanatics. Its <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> name, <em>El-Khalil,</em> signifies "the friend of God", and calls to mind Abraham who is given that appellation in James, ii, 23. The town is picturesquely situated at about 3000 feet above the sea, on a narrow plateau among the hills of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. Its only monument of interest is the "Holy Enclosure" (Haram-el-Khalil), within which stands the mosque over the burial cave of Machpelah. The Haram is in the form of a rectangular parallelogram about 200 feet long, by 120 broad, and 50 to 60 feet high. The walls are adorned with many pilasters, and are built of enormous rough stones. The style of the construction belongs to the time when the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypts</a> of the Haram at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were built, and seems Roman in character. The modern mosque is built on the site of an ancient basilica restored by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> (La Palestine, Guide historique et pratique, par des professeurs de N. D. de France &#224; J&eacute;rusalem, p. 268). The sacred enclosure is one of the finest relics of ancient architecture in Palestine, and has been admired since the time of the Pilgrim of Bordeaux (fourth century). In the opinion of many it is of Jewish origin and dates from the time of the kings of Juda (cf. Legendre in Vig., "Dict. de la Bible", s.v. H&eacute;bron). Consult Riant, "Archives", II, 412, for a list of the few travellers who, during the nineteenth century, were able to visit this sanctuary so fanatically guarded by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. In 1862 the present King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, then Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and in 1869 the Crown Prince of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, later Frederick III, were among the visitors. The trade of the town is much the same as in all <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> countries. The comparative fertility of the soil and an abundance of water contribute to increase this trade, which consists mainly in the making of goat-skin water bags, jars, and especially glass ware for which, for centuries, Hebron has used a soda extracted from the trans-Jordan regions. The vineyards around the town are very fine; they belong mainly to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who trade in dried raisins, and manufacture a syrup and an excellent wine known as Hebron wine. Of late years the Russians have contrived to get a foothold at El-Khalil, and they have now a hostelry at the entrance to the town.
