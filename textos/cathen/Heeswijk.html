<h1>Heeswijk</h1>  

<p>A village in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Hertogenbosch (Bois-le-Duc), <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, in which the dispersed religious of the confiscated <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> have created a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and college. The present name is the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> at Heeswijk. The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, two miles southeast of Heusden on the Maas, and about six miles northwest of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>, was founded in the year of St. Norbert's death, 1134, by Fulcold, Lord of Teisterband, with a colony sent from Marienweerd under Everard, its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Numerous legends surround its foundation. One is that Fulcold, when hotly pressed in battle, made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to build an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, if, by throwing himself into the river Maas, his life might be preserved from the enemy. This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> having been heard, Fulcold converted his castle at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and he himself became a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> therein. Blessed Fulcold died on 12 April, 1149, on which day his name is recorded in the <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiology</a> of the order. The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> has always been held in high esteem by the counts of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and the dukes of Brabant, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the privileges which they granted to it. It possessed the right of patronage over nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which were always served by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1534 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> obtained the privilege of wearing the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>. In the second half of the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had much to suffer from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, who plundered and partly destroyed it in 1572 and again in 1579. In 1623 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> bought the former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brothers of the Common Life</a> at Bois-le Duc, but at the capture of this town the religious were expelled and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated. In 1648 the last of what the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> once possessed in houses or in land had been confiscated. But the religious were not discouraged, and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> obtained a house at Vilvorde, near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, from which he directed the spiritual and temporal interests of his dispersed community. Several of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, though compelled to remain in hiding and always in danger, continued to minister to the spiritual wants of their people, and if some parts of North Brabant and Gelderland have preserved the Faith, the result may be ascribed to the apostolic exertions of these <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The future of the community was provided for by the admission of subjects, who made their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and continued their studies at Vilvorde or in one of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. In this manner the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> has been kept up, while nearly all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which had made no such provision, have died out in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>.

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century, the religious succeeded in renting the house of Heeswijk which had been confiscated by the State, and in 1786 they were enabled to buy the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Though dispersed, the religious met frequently at Heeswijk or in some presbytery, and at the death of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, they always elected another, so that from the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1134, there has been an unbroken succession of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. But at the end of the eighteenth century the French Republic confiscated the house at Vilvorde and so put an end to their refuge in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> were admitted as usual, who had their time of probation and made their studies either at the house at Heeswijk or in some presbytery of the order. With the arrival of better times Abbot Neefs in 1847 enlarged the house at Heeswijk and inaugurated the community life. The community grew in numbers, and in 1889 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> saw his way to open a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, the full staff of which consisted of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1893 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was able to comply with the pressing request of Bishop Messmer of <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> to send some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whose special mission would be to minister to the spiritual needs <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> settlers in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to bring back to the fold such <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as had been deceived by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> "Bishop" Vilatte. Prior Pennings, Father Lambert Broens, and a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> were sent in 1895, and were soon followed by other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. So successful were their labours in the various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> confided to them, that at present hardly a vestige of Vilatte's <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> remains. In 1898 St. Joseph's church at De Pere, Wis., was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Fathers, and from that time became the headquarters of the order in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The first stone of St. Norbert's college for classical and commercial students was laid in 1901. At the general chapter in 1902 the house at De Pere was canonically created a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, and was granted leave to have a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> attached to it. At present the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the De Pere <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> have the charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Archdiocese of Chicago</a>, and in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, and Marquette. They also have a mission among the Oneida Indains of <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. Some of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> conduct missions for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics. At the general chapter of the order in 1908 the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was declared substantially independent of the mother-abbey in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, within limits specified by the constitution of the order. The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> at Heeswijk is at present very prosperous, being filled with active and industrious members, some fulfilling the usual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, some giving missions, while others teach in the college or write for newspapers and reviews, no fewer than five of these being published by the fathers.
