<h1>Heinrich Birnbaum</h1>  

<p>(Also known as DE PIRO, the latinized form of this German name)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, b. in 1403; d. 19 February, 1473. Little is known of him before his entrance into the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Cologne on 14 March, 1435, at the age of 32 years. On account of his edifying example in the observance of the rule and his extensive scriptural and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning he was highly esteemed by his confreres, and as early as 1438, only three years after his entrance into the order, he became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mont Saint Andr&eacute; at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> (Doornik) in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The desire for a reform of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, which animated many great men of the fifteenth century, had also penetrated the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Birnbaum. Being a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reformer, he soon succeeded, by the irresistible force of his own <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> example, in abolishing the few abuses that had found admittance into the various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> over which he became prior, and in restoring the austere monastic discipline established by the founder <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>. After holding the position of prior at Mont Saint Andr&eacute; for eleven years, he was active in the same office successively at Wesel in <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>, until 1457; at Rettel in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, until 1459; at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, until 1461; and at Diest in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, until 1463. In 1463 he was appointed prior at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Liege</a>, but ill health forced him to resign this position and retire to the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he had spent the first days of this monastic life. The remaining ten years of his life Birnbaum spent in writing several ascetic works and in preparing for a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death. There were with him at that time in the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cologne some of the most learned and saintly men of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> such as Hermann Appeldorn (d. 1472), Hermann Grefken (d. 1480), Heinrich von Dissen (d. 1484), and Werner Rolewink (d. 1502). Birnbaum wrote for the instruction and direction of the members of his order a number of works, many of which, however, have not yet been put in print, also: "Defensio pro Immaculato Conceptu B.M.V.", and "Excepta ex malo granato cum nonnullis conjunctis". He has often been confounded with his uncle of the same name, one of the most learned jurists of the fifteenth century, who was for some time <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Kunibert's at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and who died in 1439.
