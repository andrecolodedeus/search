<h1>Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim</h1>  

<p>Born 14 September, 1486, at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> or <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1534 or 1535. One of the remarkable men of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> period. Described as a "<a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knight</a>, doctor, and by common reputation, a magician", Agrippa earned and repaid the bitter enmity of his more conservative contemporaries. We find him a student at Cologne and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1506), in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1507-08), a teacher of Hebrew at D&quot;le (1509), a teacher in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1510), about which time he finished his work "De occulta philosophi&acirc; (Antwerp, 1531), a mixture of Neoplatonism and the Cabbala. He spent some time in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the military service of the Emperor Maximilian, who rewarded his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> by making him a <em>Ritter</em> or <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knight</a>. He soon turned however, to other pursuits, studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, Hebrew, <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and finally devoted himself to "Cabalism" under the influence of Reuchlin and <a href="../cathen/12670c.htm">Raymund Lully</a>. He lived and taught in various places, making friends or enemies wherever he went, but was apparently not very successful financially, as he was banished from Cologne for <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, and spent his last days in poverty, a typical example of the irregular, vicissitudinous life led by his kind at that time. His numerous works, chiefly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, have a strong bias toward "occultism", and run counter to the received opinions of his time in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and scholastic philosophy. He lived and died nominally a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but was openly in sympathy with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, whose tone towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her institutions he adopted, while professing that he was merely attacking abuses, not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, an attitude frequently assumed at that period.

<p>His famous work "De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum", published in 1527, has been translated into many <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> vernaculars and is well described as a "compound of erudition and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, gravity and vanity". It abounds in denunciations of scholasticism, veneration of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the canon law and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and calls for a return to the Scriptures as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> stone (<em>Lydius lapis</em>) of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a>. For the rest he is no follower of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> or his companions. They interest him as the first who stood out with success against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a> made use of his writings, and their influence was long powerful. Among his minor writings are the often quoted booklet "De nobilitate et pr&aelig;cellentia feminei sexus declamatio", dedicated to Margaret of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, "Libellus de sacramento matrimonii", a commentary on the "Ars Brevrs", of <a href="../cathen/12670c.htm">Raymond Lully</a>, etc. A complete edition of his works appeared at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1600.
