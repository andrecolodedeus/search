<h1>Helen More</h1>  

<p>(DAME GERTRUDE.)

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of the English Congregation; b. at Low Leyton, Essex, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 25 March, 1606; d. at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 17 August, 1633. Her father, Cresacre More, was great-grandson of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Blessed Thomas More</a>; her mother, Elizabeth Gage, was sister of Sir John Gage, Baronet, of Firle, Sussex, lord chamberlain to <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>. Her mother dying at an early age, Helen's care and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> now devolved upon her father. By persuasion of Dom Benet Jones, O.S.B., she joined his projected foundation at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, and was first among nine <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> admitted to the order, 31 Dec., 1623, but vacillation of mind so disquieted her <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, that only with the greatest hesitation she pronounced her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 1 January, 1625; nor was she even then quite free from scruples and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, until she had availed herself of <a href="../cathen/02212b.htm">Dom Augustine Baker's</a> prudent guidance. A year or two later, having now become Dame Gertrude, learning from him the use of affective <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, a complete change was wrought in her; rapidly advancing in the interior life, she became a source of edification to the infant community, and, in 1629, when a choice of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> must be made, her name, conjointly with that of Catharine Gascoigne, was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> on point of age. Catharine was eventually chosen, but Gertrude was always <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as chief foundress. Supporting her <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> by lifelong devotion, promoting peace and good observance, she was universally beloved. None suffered more nor with edifying <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> than Dame Gertrude, under a heavy trial to which the community was subjected through interference of the vicar, Dom F. Hull, with <a href="../cathen/02212b.htm">Father Baker's</a> teachings. Later, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> arising as to her mode of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, formal inquiry was made, resulting in approval at the General Chapter in 1633, during the sessions of which, however, Gertrude was attacked by small-pox and died a peaceful death.

<p>Some papers found after her death and arranged by <a href="../cathen/02212b.htm">Father Baker</a>, were afterwards published in two separate works: one entitled "The Holy Practices of a Divine Lover, or the Sainctly Ideot's Devotions" (Paris, 1657); the other, "Confessiones Amantis", or "Spirtual Exercises", or "Ideot's Devotions", to which was prefixed her "Apology", for herself and for her spiritual guide (Paris, 1658), both recently republished.
