<h1>Heliogabalus</h1>  

<p>(E<font size=-2>LAGABAL</font>)

<p>The name adopted by Varius Avitus Bassianus, Roman emperor (218-222), born of a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and a grandnephew of Julia Domna, the consort of Emperor Septimus Severus. When <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Emperor Caracalla</a> had fallen a victim to a conspiracy of his officers at Carrh&aelig; in 217, the pr&aelig;torian prefect, M. Opellius Macrinus, seized the reins of power. Empress Julia Domna committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>; her sister, Julia M&aelig;sa, was exiled to Emesa with her daughters and her eldest grandchild, Avitus Bassianus. The latter was appointed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the sun-god Elagabal, whose name he adopted. A report was then spread among the soldiers in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, that Elagabalus was a son of <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a>, and by appointment the fifteen-year-old youth betook himself to the Roman camp in 218, and allowed himself to be elected emperor on 16 May by the soldiers. He received the official name of M. Aurelius Antoninus in recognition of the general desire to pay a tribute to the memory of the glorious Antonine. A rising in favour of Macrinus failed, as well as his attempt to win over the soldiers and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by bribery. An important battle fought on the borders of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Ph&oelig;nicia to the east of Antioch, was decided in favour of Heliogabalus; the troops of Macrinus, bribed by money and promises, joined the army of his opponent, while Macrinus himself was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> during the flight. Heliogabalus lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as an oriental despot and, giving himself up to detestable sensual pleasures, degraded the imperial office to the lowest point by most shameful vices, which had their origin in certain rites of oriental naturalistic religion. His mother So&aelig;mias and his grandmother Julia M&aelig;sa, who also took part in the sessions of the Senate, exercised a controlling influence over Heliogabalus. A conical, black, meteoric stone from <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a> served as the idol of the sun-god, which Heliogabalus married to the Syrian moon-goddess Astarte, introduced from Carthage, and whose high-priest became <em>pontifex maximus</em> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This led to the greatest religious confusion and disintegration among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> in the city, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> affording a marked contrast in the manner in which they maintained the integrity of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Influenced by his grandmother, the emperor adopted his so far uncorrupted twelve-year-old cousin Aurelius Alexander, and assigned him the title of C&aelig;sar. The repeated attempts of Heliogabalus to encompass his cousin's death were always frustrated by the soldiers. In a mutiny in favour of Alexander (11 March, 222) Heliogabalus was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, together with his mother.
