<h1>Henoticon</h1>  

<p>The story of the Henoticon forms a chapter in that of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the fifth and sixth centuries. It is the name of the unhappy and unsuccessful law made by the Emperor Zeno in order to conciliate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. Really, it satisfied no one and brought about the first great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople.

<p>When Zeno (474-91) came to the throne the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> trouble was at its height. The mass of the people of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> abd <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> rejected the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) altogether, and found in <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> an outlet for their national, anti-imperial feeling. The three Patriarchates of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, Proterius, had been <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 457; a fanatical <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, Timothy Aelurus (Ailuros), had been elected as his successor. He died in 477; the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> elected one <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> &mdash; the "Stammerer" &mdash; to succeed him; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, John Talaia. Peter Gnapheus (Fullo), one of the most determined leaders of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> party, occupied the See of Antioch; Theodosius, also a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Over 500 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in these <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> were open partisans of <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutyches's heresy</a>. Zeno found himself in a difficult position. On the one hand he was a friend of Peter Fullo of Antioch and sympathized with the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, on the other he was forced into the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by the fact that his rival Basiliscus (whom he succeeded in deposing) had made himself the protector of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Zeno, in spite of his personal feeling, came to the throne as the champion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. At first he protected the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (John Talaia, for instance). But he was anxious to conciliate his old friends in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and he realized how much harm this <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was doing to the empire. He therefore issued a law that was meant to satisfy every one, to present a compromise that all could accept. This law was the famous Henoticon (<em>henotikon</em>, "union"). It was published in 482.

<p>As an attempt at conceding what both parties most desired, the Henoticon is a very skillful piece of work. It begins by insisting on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> defined at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, confirmed at Constantinople, followed faithfully by the Fathers at Ephesus. Nestorius and <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> are both condemned, the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> of Cyril approved. Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, one, not two. His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and Passion are works of one (whether <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or nature, is not said). Those who divide or confuse, or introduce a phantasy (i.e. affirm a mere appearance) are condemned. One of the Trinity was incarnate. This is written not to introduce a novelty, but to satisfy every one. Who thinks otherwise, either now or formerly, either at Chalcedon or at any other synod, is <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, especially Nestorius, <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, and all their followers. It will be noticed that the Henoticon carefully avoids speaking of nature or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, avoids the standard <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> formula (<em>one Christ in two natures</em>), approves of Peter Fullo's expression (<em>one of the Trinity was incarnate</em>), names only the first three councils with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and alludes vaguely but disrespectfully to Chalcedon. There is no word against <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a>. Otherwise it offends rather by its omissions than by its assertions. It contains no actually <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> statement (the text is in <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, "H. E.", III, 14; Liberatus, "Breviarium", XVII). <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> accepted it, explaining that it virtually condemned Chalcedon and thereby secured his place as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. His rival, John Talaia, was banished. Peter Fullo at Antioch accepted the new law too. But the strict <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> were not content, and separated themselves from <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a>, forming the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> called the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a> (<em>akephaloi</em>, "without a head" - with no patriarch). Nor were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> satisfied with a document that avoided declaring the Faith on the point at issue and alluded in such a way to Chalcedon. The emporer succeeded in persuading Acacius (Akakios), <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (471-80), to accept the Henoticon, a fact that is remarkable, since Acacius had stood out firmly for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> under Basiliscus. It is perhaps explained by his personal enmity against John Talaia, <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. The Henoticon was addressed in the first place to the Egyptians, but was then applied to the whole empire. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and consistent <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were deposed, their sees were given to people who agreed to the compromise. But the emporer had not counted with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. From all parts of the East <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> sent complaints to <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Pope Felix II</a> (or III; 483-92) entreating him to stand out for the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. He then wrote two letters, one to Zeno and one to Acacius, exhorting them to continue defending the Faith without compromise, as they had done before (Epp. i et ii Felicis III in Thiel, "Epistolae Rom. Pontificum genuinae" Braunsberg, 1868, vol. I, pp. 222-39). Then John Talaia, exiled from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and gave a further account of what was happening in the East. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote two more letters, summoning Acacius to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to explain his conduct (Epp. iii et iv, ibid., pp. 239-241). The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> who brought these letters to Constantinople were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> as soon as they landed, then forced to receive Communion from Acacius in a Liturgy in which they heard <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> and other <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> named in the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, having heard of this from the Acoemeti (<em>akoimetoi</em>, sleepless) <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Constantinople, held a synod in 484 in which he denounced his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, deposed and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Acacius (Epp. vi, vii, viii, ibid., 243 sq.). Acacius retorted by striking Felix's name from his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. Thus began the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> that lasted thirty-five years (484-519). The Acoemeti <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> alone at Constantinople stayed in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; Acacius put their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Cyril, in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Acacius himself died in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in 489. His successor, Flavitas (or Fravitas, 489-90), tried to reconcile himself with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but refused to give up communion with <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and to omit Acacius's name in his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. Zeno died in 491; his successor, Anastasius I (491-518), began by keeping the policy of the Henoticon, but gradually went over to complete <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. Euphemius (490-496), patriarch after Flavitus, again tried to heal the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, restored the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name to his <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, denounced <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>, and accepted Chalcedon; but his efforts came to nothing, since he, too, refused to remove the names of Acacius and Flavitas from the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> (see Euphemius of Consstantinople). Gelasius I (492-96) succeeded <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix II</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and maintained the same attitude, denouncing absolutely the Henoticon and any other compromise with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Eventually, when the Emporer Anastasius died (518), the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was healed. His successor, Justin I (518-27), was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; he at once sought reunion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. John II, the patriarch (518-20), was also willing to heal the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In answer to their petitions, Pope Hormisdas (514-23) sent his famous formula. This was then signed by the emperor, the patriarch, and all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the capital. On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter day</a>, 24 March, 519, the union was restored. <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were deposed or fled, and the empire was once more <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, till the troubles broke out again under Justinian I (527-65).
