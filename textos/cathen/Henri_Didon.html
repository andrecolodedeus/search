<h1>Henri Didon</h1>  

<p>Preacher, writer, and educator, b. 17 March, 1840, at Touvet (Is&egrave;re), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. 13 March, 1900, at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. At the age of eighteen he left the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> to enter the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/06099b.htm">Flavigny</a>. Four years later he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to complete his studies at the Minerva. Returning to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> of sacred <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> he taught Scripture for a brief time, and began at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1868 a brilliant career as a preacher. A sincere desire to communicate his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to others, coupled with accomplished art, enabled him to make the most of the qualities of an orator with which nature had endowed him. He had a majestic carriage, strong features, a massive forehead, black eyes, a vibrating voice which he perfectly controlled, and an ease in emphasizing his words by superb gestures. Frank, straightforward, and sympathetic, he readily won the hearts of his hearers, whom he dominated by his presence and startled by his boldness. He was essentially a man of his time, an advocate of progress; but withal loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whose place in modern civilization he strenuously endeavored to strengthen. He was at his best when preaching on social subjects. He delivered the funeral oration of <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Archbishop Darboy</a>, of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who had been shot by the Communists 24 May, 1871. In the following year he preached <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> and <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> conferences in the principal churches of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, many of which he published. In 1879 he was bitterly assailed by the secular press of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the attitude he took in a series of conferences on the burning question of the indissolubility of marriage, which he discontinued at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but published in book form. A year later he was bitterly attacked by other critics while delivering <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> conferences on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and modern <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and the accusation was made that he was in contradiction with the Syllabus. Although his preaching was <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, he was sent by the master general of his order to Corbara in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. There for seven years he labored at a "Life of Christ", leaving his retreat for an extended visit in Palestine and again for a sojourn at the Universities of Leipsig, G&ouml;ttingen, and <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. In 1887 he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where, in 1890, he completed his "Life of Christ". It met with a remarkable sale and was soon translated into several languages: two English translations were made in 1891-2.

<p>In January, 1892 Father Didon reappeared in the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> when he preached at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> a religious-political sermon in favor of the Republic. He then delivered at the Madeleine in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a series of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> conferences on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (tr. Belief in the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, 1894). Thereafter he gave only occasional sermons and lectures, his time and energies being devoted to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. At the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> colleges in and near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, cultivating <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> theories but little developed elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he did away with compulsion as much as possible, taught the students that discipline is the way to liberty, fostered in them a spirit of self-reliance together with a loving reverence for authority, and checked the development of a critical spirit. Some of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> theories may be seen in his work "Les Allemands" (tr. The Germans, 1884), which is a study of the German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> with application to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; others may be found developed at length in his college addresses published in pamphlet form. The deeply <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of Father Didon is especially manifest in his "Lettres &agrave; Mlle Th. V." (Paris, 1900), which quickly went through thirty editions and appeared in English, in his "Lettres &agrave; un ami" (Paris, 1902); and "Lettres a M&egrave;re Samuel" (Ann&eacute;e Dominicaine, 1907-8). Besides the works mentioned above many of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and addresses have been published in French and some have been done into English.
