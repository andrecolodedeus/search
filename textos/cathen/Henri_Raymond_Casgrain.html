<h1>Henri Raymond Casgrain</h1>  

<p>Author of some of the best works in <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> literature, b. at Riviere Ouelle, 16 September, 1831; d. at Quebec, 2 February, 1904. His father, a proprietor of the old <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> regime who had been a member of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> ministry, gave him a careful <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the College of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatiere. Having finished his classics he studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, but became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1856. For several years he discharged his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> at Beauport and Quebec, until poor health and a serious affection of the eyes compelled him to retire; thenceforth he was free to devote himself entirely to literary pursuits. He first wrote tales, such as, "Le tableau de la riviere Ouelle", "La jongleuse", Les pionniers canadiens", for periodicals, his work appearing, 1860-68, in the "Soir&eacute;es canadiennes et foyer canadien". In these narratives, which were well received, he depicted the life and customs of the early colonists of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He has also left several biographies of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> writers, including lives of de Gasp&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/06386a.htm">Garneau</a>, Cr&eacute;mazie, <a href="../cathen/03645c.htm">Chauveau</a>. Casgrain's <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> for research led him to devote himself almost exclusively to history. His historical works include: "Histoire de la Mere Marie de l'Incarnation" (1864); "Histoire de l'H&ocirc;tel-Dieu de Qu&eacute;bec" (1878); "Une paroisse canadienne au XVIIe siecle"; "Pelerinage au pays d'Evang&eacute;line" (1855); "Montcalm et L&eacute;vis" (1891); "Une seconde Acadie" (1894); "Histoire de l'asile du Bon-Pasture de Qu&eacute;bec" (1890); "Les sulpiciens et les pr&ecirc;tres des Missions &eacute;trangers en Acadie" (1897); not to mention numerous monographs, arch&aelig;ological studies, and letters of travel written for the press. Ill-health compelled him to spend a long time in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and he turned necessity to profit by making researches in the archives of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; thus he gathered many valuable documents for he history of his own country. Under his direction the Government of Quebec published (188-1895) the collection known under the name of "Documents de L&eacute;vis", dealing with the last <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between the French and English in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which he had secured from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of this name. He also collected and published the works of Cr&eacute;mazie, the national poet of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, under the title: "uvres de Cr&eacute;mazie" (1882). Some of Casgrain's writings have been <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>. He was professor of history at <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, and president of the Royal Society of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1889-1890). As historian, poet, and literary critic Casgrain has exercised considerable influence upon the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and has accomplished much in making his country known. Although almost blind he was gifted with remarkable fecundity. That he had read in his youth many of the works of Romantic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is betrayed by a style inclined to over-elaboration, but his diction grew purer as time went on. His literary judgments are not always accurate, and his appreciations of historical events are sometimes at fault. It has been said that he was better fitted to write tales than history. However, everything considered, his work, as a whole, has real worth. Above all he was a patriot; his one thought was to increase the fame of his country. Casgrain's outlook is somewhat restricted, but his flights of fancy are frequently beautiful, and he is always interesting. He left unedited memoirs, which were bequeathed, together with his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and a part of his fortune, to <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>.
