<h1>Henri and Jules Descl&eacute;e</h1>  

<p>Henri (1830-); Jules (1828-1911).

<p>Natives of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, founders of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a printing establishment. Among the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, which at the close of the nineteenth century were driven out of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> and sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, were the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of a congregation established by the Wolter brothers, two German <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St.-Paul's-without-the-Walls. With Dom Hildebrand de Hemptinne, a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of that congregation (now <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>), Jules Descl&eacute;e had been a captain of the Pontifical Zouaves. Baron John B&eacute;thune, inspired by the same motive as the Descl&eacute;e brothers for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, had attached his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Luke to the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>; it was therefore natural for the Descl&eacute;e brothers to look to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order for the realization of their plan, and the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> fitted in perfectly with their designs. Moreover, a Count de Hemptinne had been amongst the founders of the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Luke (1862). Accordingly the brothers chose a picturesque site on an estate of Henri Descl&eacute;e's in the Province of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, for the erection of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in which to establish the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Beuron. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Maredsous, constructed in the purest <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style of the thirteenth century after the plans of Baron B&eacute;thune, is one of the finest and most remarkable masterpieces produced in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> by the movement for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> art of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Its 120 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> devote their lives to the liturgy, study, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Maredsous has thus become an important centre of religious influence and the practice and teaching of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. A college or <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were added to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1882 and 1902. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have also taken an active part in the reform of the religious chant.

<p>In 1882 the Descl&eacute;e brothers also founded an important printing establishment at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, under the title of the Society of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, their object being to restore <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> publications. The &aelig;sthetic principles by which their enterprise was to be directed were those of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Here also Baron John B&eacute;thune assisted them. At first the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> relied upon English workmen, compositors, and printers, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> being the country in which the old traditions had been best preserved. The first publications attracted the attention of connoisseurs, and the technical perfection of the work soon earned for the house a world- wide reputation. The Society, following first the work of the Rev. Dom Pothier, and afterwards the studies of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>, issued the first publications for the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">liturgical chant</a>, commonly called <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">"plain chant"</a>. These editions served as a basis for the edition brought out by the Vatican printing press, and imposed by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on the universal Church. About 1880 the Descl&eacute;e brothers resolved to apply to other branches of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature the same principles of artistic restoration which had met with such success in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> domain. Under the title of the Society of St. Augustine they founded a separate business, devoted to the publication of all kinds of books relating to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> and literature, <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>, art, archaeology, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, etc. The production of religious images forms also an important part of the work of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which possesses two establishments, one at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and the other at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
