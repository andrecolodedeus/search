<h1>Henry Bard</h1>  

<p>(Baron Bromley and Viscount Bellamont)</p>

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> soldier and diplomat, b. 1604; d. 1660. He was the son of the Reverend George Bard, Vicar of Staines, Middlesex, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, a representative of an old Norfolk <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Eton, and in 1632 entered King's College, Cambridge, where he took the Master's degree and a fellowship. Before this date he had travelled considerably, having visited <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and journeyed on foot through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, Palestine, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It is alleged that during his sojourn in the last country he surreptitiously got possession of a copy of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> which was the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of one of the mosques, and which he appropriated and afterwards presented to his college.

<p>Bard's habits of life were expensive, the liberality and generosity of his wealthy brother, Maximilian, enabling him to indulge them. His accomplishments included the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of several languages and, coupled with his experience as a traveller and a wide <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of men and events, served to commend him to Charles I, with whom he became a favourite, and whose policy throughout the Civil War he sustained as a strong partisan. He was one of the earliest to take up arms in the king's behalf, obtaining through the queen a colonel's commission. He distinguished himself at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and at the battle of Cheriton Down, was severely wounded, lost an arm, and was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. In May of 1646 he received his discharge and on again joining the king received the reversionary grant of the office of Governor of the Island of Guernsey and Captain of Cornet Castle. Later he was appointed to the command of a brigade and was made governor of Camden House, Gloucestershire. Failing to hold this post against the assaults of the Parliamentarians, he burned the house to the ground.

<p>Bard was also Governor of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> about 1643, and in October, 1646, he distinguished himself by being among the first to scale the ramparts, a feat which he is said to have performed at Naseby also. On 8 July, 1646, he was created Baron Bard and Viscount Bellamont in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In the following December Bard was again taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, when on his way to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but was finally liberated on his promising to go beyond the sea and never to return without permission. The court of Charles II at <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a> furnished the needed resting-place. In May of 1649 he was arrested, charged with murdering Dr. Dorislaus. The charge came to naught, and in 1656 Bard was sent from <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> as special ambassador by Charles II to the Shah of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, to obtain financial help to recover the throne of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The mission failed, as the Persian monarch was under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for aid rendered him at Ormuz and was therefore unable to comply with the request of Charles. Bard, who had been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> for several years, lost his life in a windstorm in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Arabia about 1660.
