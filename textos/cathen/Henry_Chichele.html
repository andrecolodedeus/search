<h1>Henry Chichele</h1>  

<p>(Or Chicheley)</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, b. at Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1362; d. at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, 12 April, 1441. He was the son of Thomas Chichele, a yeoman, and Agnes, daughter of William Pyncheon. Eucated by <a href="../cathen/15641a.htm">William of Wykeham</a> at St. John the Baptist's College, <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, he passed from there to New College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. He took the degree of B.C.L. in 1389-90, and the degree of LL.D. in 1396. Llanvarchall, in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, was his first living, and he held in succession the rectory of St. Stephen's, Walbrook, the archdeaconry of Dorset, together with a <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> (1397), a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in the collegiate church of Aberguilly (1400), a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a> (1400), the archdeaconry of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> (1402), the chancellorship of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, together with the living of Odiham in the <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Diocese of Winchester</a> (1403), and the livings of Melcombe and Sheraton in the <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Diocese of Salisbury</a>. Following upon these came his appointment by provision to the Bishopric of St. David by <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> (17 June, 1408).

<p>Early in his career he was admitted an advocate in the <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">Court of Arches</a> and for a time acted as the lawyer for Richard Mitford, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. His skill in legal matters attracted the king's notice, and in July, 1405, he was sent with Sir John Cheyne on a mission to <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>. Later in the same year he treated with the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as a commissioner of peace, and in 1407 he journeyed again to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on an embassy to <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. It was on this occasion that he received the Bishopric of St. David from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, with the king's approval. He was again in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1409), and it was not until May, 1411, that he first visited his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>. The Diocese of St. David must have seen very little of him, for he went as king's ambassador to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with the Earl of Warwick in 1413, and early in the following year on the death of Arundel, the king nominated him to the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (19 February, 1414), to which he was elected on the 4th of March. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he was the king's trusted friend and councillor. He seems to have favoured the policy of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, collecting much money for its support; in 1419 and again in 1420 he accompanied Henry V into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. A keen and skilful lawyer, he was active in all legislative matters, particularly with regard to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, and vigorous in searching out and suppressing the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a>. His loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> policy of opposing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Provisors and Pr&aelig;munire has been <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>; the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have looked upon him as the upholder of the independence of the national Church against the claims of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He certainly displeased <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, who slighted him by offering a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat and the powers of a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> to Henry Beaufort, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> again passed him by in 1439, when <a href="../cathen/08616b.htm">Kemp</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and given precedence over him in Parliament in spite of Chichele's appeal against such treatment. On two occasions, in 1421 and 1422, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> severely reprimanded Chichele for his weakness in not procuring the abolition of the obnoxious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> charged him with hindering the liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and suspended him from the office of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> which pertained to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Though he appealed from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the judgment of a future council we find him submitting to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> wishes and endeavouring to persuade the Commons to cease withstanding the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (1428).

<p>Chichele was a munificent benefactor to his birthplace, his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. At Higham Ferrers he built and endowed a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for eight <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, four clerks, and six choristers; he founded also a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> there for twelve poor men. He gave two hundred marks for the relief of poor students at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; this sum was preserved in a chest known as "Chichele's Chest". To New College he gave a similar sum of money. He built the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> College of St. Bernard, now St. John's, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, but his greatest work for his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was the foundation of the College of All Souls for a warden and forty fellows, who were to spend their time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study. His name is still perpetuated in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, for the one who fills the chair of modern history is known as the "Chichele Professor". The last years of his life were chiefly spent at Oxford superintending his great foundation there. Old age and infirmity prompted him to suggest his resignation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (1442), but before the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> arrangements could be made he died.
