<h1>Henry Cole</h1>  

<p>A confessor of the Faith, b. at Godshill, Isle of Wight, about 1500; d. in the Fleet Prison, February, 1579 or 1580. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and New College Oxford, admitted a perpetual fellow there (1523), received the degree of B.C.L. (1525), and then went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for seven years, residing chiefly at Padua. During his career he was successively <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of Yatminster (1539) <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Chelmsford, Essex, <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of Holborn, Sweting (1541), and Wenlakesbarn (1542), warden of New College (1542-51), and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Newton Longue-ville in Buckinghamshire. Created a D.C.L. at Oxford (1540), he resigned his fellowship the same year. At first he conformed to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a> but afterwards saw his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> about 1547, and eventually resigned all his preferments. In <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary's</a> reign he became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, a canon of Westminster (1554), <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> (1557), and a judge of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> Court of Audience. He was one of the commissioners who restored <a href="../cathen/15091a.htm">Tunstal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bonner</a> to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, a disputant against Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer at Oxford (1554), a delegate for the visitation of Oxford (1556), and Visitor of All Souls College in 1558, in which year he received the rectory of Wrotham, and was sent to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> with a commission for the suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> there. <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> appointed Cole one of his executors. During Elizabeth's reign he remained true to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and took part in the discussions begun at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> in 1559. Then began his sufferings: first, he was fined 500 marks ($1600), then deprived of all his preferments, committed to the Tower (20 May, 1560), and finally removed to the Fleet (10 June), where he remained for nearly twenty years, until his death. He wrote: letters to Dr. Starkey and Sir Richard Morysin from Padua, 1530, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1537; "Disputation with Cranmer, Ridley and Latimer at Oxford", in Fox's "Acts and Monuments", "Sum and effect of his sermon at Oxford when Archbishop Cranmer was burnt", in Fox's "Acts and Monuments"; "Answer to the first proposition of the Protestants at the disputation before the Lords at Westminster 1559", in Burnet's "Hist. Reform. Records"; "Copie of a Sermon at Paule's Crosse 1560" (London, 1560), "Letters to John, Bishop of Sarum" (London, 1560); "Answers to certain parcels of the Letters of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sarum", in Jewel's works.
