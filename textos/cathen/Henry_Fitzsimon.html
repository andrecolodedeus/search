<h1>Henry Fitzsimon</h1>  

<p>(Fitz Simon).

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, b. 1566 (or 1569), in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. 29 Nov., 1643 (or 1645), probably at Kilkenny. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> at Oxford (Hart Hall, and perhaps Christ Church), 1583-1587. Going thence to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, he became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> protagonist of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, "with the firm intention to have died for it, if need had been". But having engaged in controversy with "an owld <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Thomas Darbishire, to my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> I was overcome." Having embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where in 1592, he "elected to militate under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> standard, because they do most impugn the impiety of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>". In 1595 there was a call for <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> laborers for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, which had been deprived of them for ten years. He at once offered himself for the post of danger, and he shares with Father Archer the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having refound that mission on a basis that <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> permanent amid innumerable dangers and trials. Keeping chiefly to Dublin and Drogheda, he was wondrously successful in reconciling <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and he loudly and persistently challenged the chief <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> divines to disputation. With the same fighting spirit, he laughed at his capture in 1600. "Now", he said, "my adversaries cannot say that they do not know where to find me", and he would shout his challenges from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> window at every passing parson. But his opponents, James Ussher, Meredith Hanmer, and John Rider, in spite of their professions, carefully avoided coming to close quarters with their redoubtable adversary.

<p>Banished in 1604, he visited <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, 1611-1620, everywhere earnest and active with voice and pen in the cause of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. At the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> in 1620, he served as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers in the imperial army, and published a diary, full of life and interest, of his adventurous experiences. He probably returned to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> in 1621 and in 1630 went back to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> where he continued to work with energy and success until the outbreak of the Civil War (1640). In the ensuing tumult and confusion, we are unable to follow his later movements with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. At one time we hear he was under sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, from which he escaped in the winter of 1641 to the Wicklow Mountains, and after many sufferings died in peace, probably in Kilkenny. "Not many, if any Irishmen", says his biographer, reflecting on the many <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, towns, courts, and armies which Father Fitzsimon had visited, "have known, or been known to, so many men of mark". Besides one controversial work in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, not known to previous biographers, now at Oscott College, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, which is entitled "A revelation of contradictions in reformed articles of religion", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1633, he wrote two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> treatises, now lost, against Rider, and afterwards printed against him "A Catholic Confutation" (Rouen, 1608); Britannomachia Ministrorum" (1614); "Pugna Pragensis" (1620) and "Buquoii Quadrimestreiter, Auctore Constantio Peregrino" (Br&uuml;nn, 1621, several editions, also Italian and English versions); Catalogus Pr&aelig;cipuorum Sanctorum Hiberni&aelig;" (1611, several editions), important as drawing attention to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a> at a time of great depression. His "Words of Comfort to Persecuted Catholics", "Letters from a Cell in Dublin Castle", and "Diary of the Bohemian War of 1620", together with a sketch of his life, were published by Father Edmund Hogan, S.J. (Dublin, 1881).
