<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Henry IV</h1>  

<p>German King and Roman Emperor, son of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a> and Agnes of Poitou, b. at Goslar, 11 November, 1050; d. at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, 7 August, 1108. The power and resources of the empire left behind by Conrad II, which <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a> had already materially weakened, were still further impaired by the feebleness of the queen regent, who was devoid of political ability. The policy of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a>, which had been chiefly directed to Church affairs, had already called forth the opposition of the princes. But now, under the regency, which continued the same policy, the hostility between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and temporal nobles came to a climax on the kidnapping of the king from Kaiserswert (1062). The regency passed into the hands of the princes after the seizure of the boy-king. At the outset Archbishop Anno of Cologne had charge of the government of the empire and supervised the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the royal child. But he was soon compelled to accept the energetic Adalbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, as a colleague. The boy's whole heart went out to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a>, splendour-loving <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. That <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was now de facto the real ruler of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He returned with vigorous steps to the deserted paths of Conrad II's policy and attempted, not in vain, to restore the empire's prestige, particularly in the East. At the Diet of Tribur this masterful <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> fell a victim to the jealous hostility of the princes (1066). It now appeared that the young king was quite able to satisfy his violent craving for independence; and he determined to carry out the policy of Adalbert.

<p>Henry IV's real political independence did not begin until 1070. When he seized the reins of government, thanks to the energetic rule of Adalbert, the condition of the empire was no worse than at the death of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a>. But, meantime, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had been entirely emancipated from the imperial power, and the German Church, on which Otto the Great had built up his power, had become more closely united to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and ceased to be a constitutional state church. Consequently, though this did not appear immediately, the foundations of the Othonian system were undermined. Strong and energetic <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had appeared on the scene and found allies. On the one hand the powers of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> offered a valuable support to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Here Beatrice of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> had contracted a matrimonial alliance with the unruly Duke Godfrey of Lorraine. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand's</a> admirable conciliatory policy had likewise gained allies in the southern half of the peninsula among the Normans. And finally the high Church party did not lack friends even in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Pataria of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, a democratic movement that combined an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> with an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform agitation, was won over by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> to the cause of the Papal See.

<p>This policy inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> had already indicated opposition to the empire. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that one the German side there was a reaction against violations of the legal status prevailing in papal elections and other affairs: but definiteness of aim and enduring vigour were on the side of the reform party and its masterful spokesman <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, who, as <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, was soon to come forward as the young king's opponent. (See <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">CONFLICT OF INVESTITURES</a>.) Hatred and passion distorted the portraits of both these men in contemporary history. Even today we can see only faint outlines of these two men, the central figures of a tragedy of world-wide historical import. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Henry IV had a good literary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, but that his literary and artistic interests were not profound and were not, as in the case of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, submerged in unpractical <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>. He was a conscious realist. He failed altogether to understand the politico-religious aims of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> policy. Some of his contemporaries disparaged his moral character, with some <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> perhaps, but certainly with much exaggeration. Of course his nature was passionate: that is probably the reason he never in his whole life acquired a refined harmony of character. At times he was plunged in the depths of despair, but he always reacted against the most serious disasters, overcame the worst fits of despondency and was ready to renew the combat. He was also a clever, though perhaps not always an honest diplomat. This hapless king was truly the idol of his people because of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as a ruler, his earnest defence of the dignity of the empire and his benevolent care for the peace of the empire and the welfare of the common people.

<p>Henry had no sooner become independent than he reverted to the principles that governed the policy of Conrad II. He also founded his military power on the ministerials, the lower nobility. These ministerials were to counterbalance the power of the spiritual and temporal princes, the latter of whom, however, were beginning to achieve territorial independence and to establish within the State a power that could not be overestimated. With his usual hopefulness Henry expected to be able to crush them: he believed that he could at least revive the power of Conrad II. Henry's strong hand first made itself felt in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Otto von Northeim lost his duchy and important possessions in Saxony besides. The king bestowed the duchy on Guelph IV, son of Azzo of Este. We now see at once how well considered was Henry's policy; for from the Saxon lands of Otto von Northeim he sought to create a well rounded personal domain which was to provide an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> basis for his royal power. This personal domain he sought to protect by means of royal fortresses. But to the ever restless Saxons, whose ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> the king had indubitably violated in the consolidation of his landed possessions, these fortresses might well appear so many threats to their liberties. Soon, not only in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, but elsewhere throughout the empire, the particularist princes rose to oppose the vigorous centralizing policy of the emperor. The situation assumed a dangerous aspect. Henry's diplomatic skill was now shown. Through the mediation of the spiritual princes the Treaty of Gerstungen (1074) was effected, by which, on the one hand, the king's possessions were left intact, while, on the other, the insurgents secured the dismantling of the royal fortresses and the restoration of all their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. But soon the revolt broke out anew and was not subdued until Henry's victory at the Unstrut (1075), which resulted in the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. Henry seemed to have attained all his desires. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, the particularist forces had only withdrawn for the moment and were awaiting a favourable opportunity to break the chains which fettered their independence. The opportunity soon came.

<p>In 1073 <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> had ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. The "greatest ecclesiastical statesman", as von Ranke calls him, directed his attacks against the traditional right of the German kings to participate in the filling of vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> synod of 1075 in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he forbade investiture by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to cease being dependents of the Crown and become materially the dependents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. That foreboded a death-blow to the existing constitution of the empire. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire were also the most important officials of the empire: the imperial church domains were also the chief source of income of the emperor. It was a question of life and death for the German Crown to retain its ancient influence over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A bitter conflict between the two powers began. A synod at Worms (1076) deposed <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. Bishops and king again found their interests threatened by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> answer to Henry's action was to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him at the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> synod of the same year. For the particularist powers this was the signal of revolt. At Tribur Henry's opponents formed an alliance. Here the final decision in Henry's case was left to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and a resolution was passed that if Henry were not freed from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> within a year he should forfeit the empire. At this critical juncture, Henry decided on a surprising step. He submitted himself to solemn <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penance and thus forced <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to free him from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (1077).

<p>By doing so <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> in no wise gave up his design of making himself the arbiter of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> opinion Henry's penance could only postpone but not prevent this arbitration. Henry was satisfied once more to set his feet on solid ground. But the German princes now broke out into open revolution. They set Rudolph of Rheinfelden up as a rival king. With his difficulties, however, Henry's ability grew more apparent. He had recourse to his superior resources as a diplomatist. In his struggle with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who took the side of the German princes, he made use of the opposition within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> against the hierarchical aims of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>; in his dispute with the princes and their rival king Henry looked for support to the loyalty of the masses, who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> him as the preserver of order and peace. After several years of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, Rudolph lost his throne and his life at M&ouml;lsen in 1080. By his death the opposition in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> lost their leader. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> also affairs took a more favourable turn for Henry. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in 1080 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Henry anew, but the ban did not make the same impression as before. Henry retorted by setting up <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert of Ravenna</a>, who proclaimed himself <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> under the title of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>. The growing opposition within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> aided Henry on his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1081. From 1081 to 1084 he went four times to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. Finally his <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> was able to crown him in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. Soon after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was liberated by his Norman allies and escorted to <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, where he died, 25 May, 1085.

<p>The struggle was continued under <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> second successor, <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, who was determined to follow in <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> footsteps. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was suffering from the horrors of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and the great masses of the people still supported their king, who in 1085 proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">Truce of God</a> for the whole empire. By means of skilful negotiation he now succeeded in winning over the greater part of the Saxons, to whom he restored their ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. On the other hand the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> loyal to the king had been thinned out by the clever and energetic policy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Moreover a new and dangerous coalition was formed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> when the seventeen-year old <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> married Matilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> who had reached the age of forty. Henry's efforts to break up this alliance were successful at first; but at this point his son Conrad deserted him. The latter had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and formed alliances with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>-Tuscan party. This had a paralysing effect on the emperor, who passed the year 1094 inactive in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> became the leader of the West, in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. Fortunately for Henry's interests the younger <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> now dissolved his marriage with Matilda, and the elder <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> made his peace with the king once more. The latter was now able to return to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and compel his enemies to recognize him. His son Henry was elected king in 1098.

<p>Henry sought to restore order once more, even to the point of proclaiming general peace throughout the empire (1103). This policy of pacification benefited the great mass of the people and the rapidly growing cities and was directed against the disorderly lay nobility. Perhaps this may have induced the newly chosen young king to take up arms in rebellion against his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Perhaps he wished to make sure of the sympathies of this nobility. At all events the younger Henry gathered a host of malcontents around his banner in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1104. Supported by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to whom he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> obedience, he betook himself to <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, where he soon reawakened the traditional dissatisfaction. No humiliation was spared the prematurely aging emperor, who was kept <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in B&ouml;ckelheim by his intriguing son and compelled to abdicate, while only those elements on whom he had always relied, particularly the growing cities, stood by him. Once more the emperor succeeded in gathering troops around his standard at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. But just as his son was drawing near at the head of an army Henry died. After some opposition his adherents buried him in <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>. In him perished a man of great importance on whom, however, fortune frowned. Still his achievements considered from the point of view of their historical importance, were by no means insignificant. As defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Crown and of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the empire, he saved the monarchy from a premature end, menaced though it was by the universal disorder.
