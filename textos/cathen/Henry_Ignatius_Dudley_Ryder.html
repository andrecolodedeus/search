<h1>Henry Ignatius Dudley Ryder</h1>  

<p>English Oratorian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and controversialist, b. 3 Jan., 1837; d. at Edgbaston, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, 7 Oct., 1907; was the eldest son of George Dudley Ryder, one of the numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church of England</a> who followed in the steps of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. He was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1846. The grandfather, Henry Dudley Ryder, a son of the first Lord Harrowby, was a prominent Evangelical in the early years of the last century, and was the first of the party to be raised to the episcopate. He was successively <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gloucester and Lichfield and Coventry. His kneeling <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> by Chantrey will be remembered by all visitors of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, in his "Apologia", speaks of the veneration in which he held Bishop Ryder. George Ryder married Sophia, a daughter of the Rev. John Sargent. The three other Misses Sargent married respectively Samuel Wilberforce, who became Bishop, first of Oxford, and then of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>; <a href="../cathen/15620b.htm">Henry Wilberforce</a>; and <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Henry Edward Manning</a>, the future <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>.

<p>Father Ryder's lifelong connection with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and the Oratory began as a private pupil, when he was about twelve years old. The only interruption was a year at the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and a few months at the Catholic University at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, before he began in December, 1856, his Oratorian <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. In 1863 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a> death he was elected superior of the Birmingham Oratory and held this office till his health gave way. He was the last survivor of "my dearest brothers of this House, the Priests of the Birmingham Oratory" to whom <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> dedicated his "Apologia". His grave is with theirs and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a> at Rednal, a small country house belonging to the Birmingham Oratory, about seven miles from <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>. His life was uneventful. He cared little for <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> or even fame. Once only did he push himself forward, and then it was to incur obloquy rather than applause. This was in 1867-8, when he attacked <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>, at that time editor of "The Dublin Review", and a leading spirit among an influential section of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who were singularly intolerant towards those who differed from them. <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a> seemed to think of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as unceasingly exercising his very highest prerogative. All <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> instructions contained in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents, such as encyclicals and the like were <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> utterances. The Syllabus, together with all the documents which it quotes, was certainly <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. So also, most probably, were the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> Decrees of the Index and the Holy Office, when sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by his order. These opinions were put forward not tentatively, but as the only possible ones for a loyal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In other words, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a> was caricatured by its would-be defender in almost exactly the same way that it was caricatured a few years later by the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Schulte (see FESSLER). Against these extravagances Ryder delivered his protest in three pamphlets, remarkable both for their literary style and the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they displayed. He earned for his reward, as he himself in later years expressed it, "the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> portion of stones"; but time has shown that he was mainly in the right; within a very few years his opponent had to retract many of his more pronounced opinions in deference to the teaching of Roman <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. It should be added that Ryder fully believed in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> before it was defined

<p>His literary output was small. Apart from a number of articles in American and English magazines, he published "Idealism in Theology, a Review of Dr. Ward's scheme of Dogmatic Authority" (London, 1867); "A letter to W.G. Ward on his theory of Infallible Instruction" (London, 1868); "Postscriptum to Letter, etc." (London, 1868); "A critique upon Mr. Foulkes' Letter" (London, 1869); "Catholic Controversy", a reply to Littledale's "Plain Reasons" (London, 1880); "Poems Original and Translated" (Dublin, 1882). There is besides "Essays of the Rev. H. I. D. Ryder, edited by Francis Bacchus" (London, 1911). "His literary ideal", writes Mr. Wilfrid Ward, "was so high; his self-criticism so unsparing, that much which might have secured him a wider reputation was set aside. Quantify was sacrificed in preference to letting the world see anything which he himself felt to fall short of his own high standard in quality."
