<h1>Henry James Coleridge</h1>  

<p>A writer and preacher, b. 20 September 1822, in Devonshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; d. at Roehampton, 13 April 1893. He was the son of Sir John Taylor Coleridge, a Judge of the King's Bench, and brother of John Duke, Lord Coleridge, Chief Justice of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His grandfather, Captain James Coleridge, was brother to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the poet and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. He was sent to Eton at the age of thirteen and thence to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, having obtained a scholarship at <a href="../cathen/15057a.htm">Trinity College</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> career was distinguished; in 1844 he took the highest honours in a fellowship at Oriel, then the blue ribbon of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1848 he received <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a>. The Tractarian movement being then at its height, Coleridge, with many of his tutors and friends, joined its ranks and was an ardent disciple of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> till his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He was one of those who started "The Guardian" newspaper as the organ of the High Church partly being for a time its Oxford sub-editor. Gradually various incidents, the secession of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, Dr. Hampden's appointment as Regius Professor of Theology, the condemnation and suspension of <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey</a>, the condemnation and deprivation of <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>, and the decision in the celebrated Gorham case, seriously shook his confidence in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. In consequence Dr. Hawkins, Provost of Oriel, declined to admit him as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> tutor, and he therefore accepted a curacy at Alphinton, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> recently separated from that of Ottery St. Mary, the home of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had built for him a house and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Here, with most congenial work, he was in close connection with those to whom he was already bound by a singular affection. His <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to his religious position continued, however, to grow and early in 1852 he determined that he could no longer remain in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Communion</a>.

<p>On <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">Quinquagesima</a> Sunday (February 22) he bade farewell to Alphington, and in April, after a retreat at Clapham under the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Determined to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he proceeded in the following September to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and entered Accademia dei Nobili, where he had for companions several of his Oxford friends, and others, including the future <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> and <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Vaughan</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1856 and six months later took the degree of D.D. In the summer of 1857 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and on the 7th of September entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Novitiate, which was then at Beaumont Lodge, Old Windsor, his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> master being Father Thomas Tracy Clarke, for whom to the end of his life he entertained the highest admiration and esteem. In 1859 he was sent to the Theological College of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno's</a>, North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, as a professor of Scripture, and remained there until, in 1865, he was called to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to become the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> editor of "The Month", a magazine started under other management in the previous year. Then commenced a course of indefatigable literary labour by as which he is best known. Besides the editorship of "The Month", to which, after the death of Father William Maher, in 1877, he added that of "The Messenger", and for which he was one of the most prolific writers, Father Coleridge projected and carried on the well known Quarterly Series to which he himself largely contributed, both with his great work "The Public Life of Our Lord" and others, such as "The Life and Letters of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>" and "The Life and Letters of St. Teresa". Worthy of mention also is his Harmony of the Gospels, "Vita Vitae Nostrae", a favourite book for meditation, published also in an English version. Studies based on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> were his work of predilection, a taste which seems to have been acquired, at least in part from his old Oxford tutor, Isaac Williams. For a time he was also superior of his religious brethren in Farm Street, London. In 1881 failing health <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to resign "The Month" to another Oxonian, Father Richard F. Clarke, but he continued to labour on "The Life of Our Lord" which he earnestly desired to finish. In 1890 a paralytic seizure compelled him to withdraw to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Roehampton, where, with indomitable spirit, he succeeded in completing his <em>magnum opus</em> before passing away. The chief sources for his life are articles in The Month, June, 1893, by his friend James Patterson, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, and Father Richard F. Clarke, S.J.
