<h1>Henry Nutcombe Oxenham</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> controversialist and poet, born at Harrow, 15 Nov., 1829; died at Kensington, 23 March, 1888; was the son of the Rev. William Oxenham, second master of Harrow. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Harrow School and Balliol College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, taking his degree in 1850. After receiving <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a>, he became <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> first at Worminghall, in Buckinghamshire, then at St. Bartholomew's, Cripplegate. While at the latter place, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Monsignor (afterwards Cardinal) Manning</a>. For a time he contemplated becoming a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for which purpose he entered St. Edmund's College, Old Hall, but after receiving <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, he left: it is said that his reason was that he believed in the validity of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a>, and considered himself already a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He continued to dress as an ecclesiastic and in this anomalous position he spent the remainder of his life. His <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to work for the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with which end in view, he published a sympathetic article, in answer to <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey's</a> "Eirenicon", in the shape of a letter to his friend and fellow-convert, Father Lockhart . After the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> his position became still more anomalous, for his unwillingness to accept the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> was known. Though influenced by the action of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">Dr. D&ouml;llinger</a>, with whom he was on intimate terms, he never outwardly severed his connexion with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and before his death received all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> at the hands of Father Lockhart.

<p>His published works include: "The Sentence of Kaires and Poems" (3rd ed., London, 1871); Translation of D&ouml;llinger's "First Age of Christianity" (London, 1866, 2 vols: two subsequent editions) and "Lectures on Reunion" (London, 1872); "Catholic Eschatology" (1876; new edition, enlarged, 1878); "Memoir of Lieut. Rudolph de Lisle, R. N." (London, 1886); numerous pamphlets and articles, especially in "The Saturday Review", over the initials X. Y. Z.
