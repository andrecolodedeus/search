<h1>Henry of Ghent</h1>  

<p>(HENRICUS DE GANDAVO, known as the DOCTOR SOLEMNIS)

<p>A notable scholastic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the thirteenth century, better known by his works than by his life; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or Tournai, 1293. He was born at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The exact year of his birth, early in the thirteenth century, is unknown, as is also his family name, the name <em>Goethals</em> (<em>Bonicollii</em>) being an invention. He was called also Henricus de Muda or Mudanus or ad Plagam, probably from his place of residence in the town of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, where we find him living in 1267 as a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> and canon. In 1276, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his first<em> disputatio de quodlibet, </em>he appears as <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and a few years subsequently as <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. Although he does not seem to have resided permanently at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, he must have taught for frequent and prolonged periods at the great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, for he was well known and highly esteemed there. In 1277 he received the degree of <em>Magister </em>or Doctor of Theology. In 1282 he was selected with two others by <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> to arbitrate in the dispute about the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a> in regard to hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>: he defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as against <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> and the regulars. From this to the end of his life he figured prominently in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> as well as in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> life of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Recent researches have eliminated much of the legendary from his biography, notably the story that he was a <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> or at least a member of some <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Henry ranks immediately below his great contemporaries, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, St. Bonaventure, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">John Duns Scotus</a>. He lived through the golden age of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, in the midst of the intense <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity which marked the close of the thirteenth century. His two greatest works, the "Quodlibeta" and the "Summa Theologica", show him to be by preference a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologist</a> and metaphysician. He treated all the great debated questions of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with an originality that gives his work quite a personal impress. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, too, forms a consistent whole, with perhaps the single exception of his teaching on the <em>Divina Scientia</em>, which scarcely harmonizes with the rest of his philosophy. Wherever he differs from St. Thomas (e.g. on the Principle of Individuation, the existence of <em>Materia Prima</em>, the plurality of the "formative" principle in man), or from his contemporaries generally (e.g. in rejecting the<em> species intelligibilis </em>in his theory of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>), his own views are seldom as sound or satisfactory as theirs, though his criticisms of the latter are often vigorous and convincing. His occasional want of clearness has exposed him to severe criticism, especially from <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>. Hence also some have claimed, but without sufficient foundation, to detect the seeds of unorthodox views in his philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He has been somewhat persistently described as a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, but such a description is misleading. Like the other great scholastics he was an intelligent, not a servile, follower of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. His philosophy is peripatetic, but he supplemented and completed it by drawing largely on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> through St. Augustine, thus transmitting the wholesome Augustinian element in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> to <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> and his successors. Henry's writings reflect much deep and searching thought on the perennial problems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and religion. Their perusal will persuade the impartial inquirer that much of our <em>modern</em> knowledge about these matters is <em><a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a></em>.

<p>Henry is the author of the following works: "Disputationes Quodlibetales" or "Quodlibeta" (Paris, 1518; Venice, 1608, 1613; "Summa Theologica," incomplete, containing only the prologue and theodicy (Ghent, 1520; Ferrara, 1646); "Liber de Scriptoribus Illustribus", probably not authentic (Cologne, 1580). Still unpublished: a short "Treatise on Logic" (Bruges and Erfurt <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>); a "Commentary on Aristotle's Physics" (Paris, Bib. Nat., n. 1660); "Questions on Aristotle's Metaphysics", of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity (<a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>); a treatise "De Virginitate" (Brussels and Berlin <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>); "Questiones super Decretalibus" (Vienna <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>); many unpublished sermons.
