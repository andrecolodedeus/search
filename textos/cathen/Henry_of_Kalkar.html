<h1>Henry of Kalkar</h1>  

<p>(Egher).

<p><a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> writer, b. at Kalkar in the Duchy of Cleves in 1328; d. at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 20 December, 1408. Henry began his studies at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and completed them at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he became Master of Arts in 1357. He forthwith occupied the post of <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the German nation in 1358, being also a professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Having obtained <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> in the collegiate churches of St. Swibert in Kaiserswerth and St. George in Cologne in 1362, he returned to his native land. Soon after, however, disgusted with the world, he retired in 1365 to the Charterhouse of Cologne, where, owing to his talents and virtues, he was rapidly raised to the most important offices. Successively <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Charterhouses of Arnheim (1368-72), of Ruremonde (1372-77), which he had built, of Cologne (1377-84) and of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (1384-96), which he restored, and visitor of his province for the space of 20 years, he was thus called upon to play, under the trying circumstances produced by the Great Schism, a considerable role in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and German-speaking countries. Relieved at length, at his earnest request, of all his offices, he retired in 1396 to the Charterhouse of Cologne, and there lived in recollection and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> until his death.

<p>Henry of Kalkar was celebrated not only as a writer, but also as a reformer. During his priorate at Arnheim he had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of "converting" one of his friends and fellow-students at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard Groote</a> (the future founder of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">"Brothers of the Common Life"</a>), whom he attracted into his Charterhouse and directed for three years. "Moreover by his spiritual writings . . . . he exercised on the whole <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Deventer and Windesheim the influence of a recognized master." He was to this extent the organizer of the great movement of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Catholic Renaissance</a>, which, initiated at <a href="../cathen/15651a.htm">Windesheim</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Low Countries, went on developing throughout the fifteenth century, finding its definite expression in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He distinguished himself in the eyes of his contemporaries by his religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, his great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and above all by his remarkable devotion towards the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, who, it is said, deigned to appear to him several times. Indeed such was his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, that many attributed to him, though wrongly, the institution of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and the composition of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>, and [Saint Peter] Canisius went so far as to insert his name in his German <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> for 20 December.

<p>As a writer he has left a number of works on very diverse subjects. At once a man of learning and letters, a distinguished musician, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and ascetic, he composed the treatises: "Loquagium de rhetorica", "Cantuagium de music&acirc;", "De Continentiis et Distinctione Scientiarum", and was also the author of sermons, letters, treatises on the spiritual life, etc. These works, which have never been printed, are scattered about in different <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> &mdash; at Basle, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, St. Gall, etc. One alone has been published and has enjoyed a strange career, the "Exercitatorium Monachale" or "Tractatus utilis proficere volentibus". Inserted in a number of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the "Imitation" between the first and third books, it has sometimes passed as an unedited book of that work, and was published as such by Dr. Liebner at G&ouml;ttingen in 1842. Several times reprinted, especially by Mgr. Malou in his "Recherches sur le v&eacute;ritable auteur de l'Imitation", it has been translated into French (Waille, Paris, 1844) under the title "L'Imitation de J. C., livre in&eacute;dit trouv&eacute; dans la biblioth&egrave;que de Quedlinbourg". Moreover it has in great part passed into the "Mystica theologia" (chap. I) of Henry of Balma, and into the treatise "De Contemplatione" (lib. I, art. xxi) of Denis the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, and, after having inspired <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a> and Garcia de Cisneros, it furnished St. Ignatius himself with some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> for his famous "Exercises".
