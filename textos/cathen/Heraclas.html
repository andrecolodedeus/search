<h1>Heraclas</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> from 231 or 232; to 247 or 248. Of his earlier life <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> tells us, when defending his own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.19</a>): "In this we imitated Pant&aelig;nus, who before our day assisted many and had no little <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these matters, and Heraclas, who is now one of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, whom I found a hearer of my own teacher of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, for he had already been with him for five years before I began to attend these lectures. On this teacher's account he put aside the ordinary dress he had worn till then, and assumed the garb of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, which he still wears, and he ceases not to study the books of the Greeks with all his might." Thus Heraclas was probably at least five years older than <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who was born in 185. Yet when <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in his eighteenth year was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the consequent confiscation of his goods to commence teaching grammar (for a short time) and philosophy, Heraclas and his brother Plutarch were the first pupils of the young teacher. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> converted them both to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and St. Plutarch soon suffered for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being the first of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> pupils to gain the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Heraclas "gave a great example of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> life and <em>askesis</em> (ibid., vi, 33), and it was his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and Greek learning that drew <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> to visit Alexandria. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> found his day so occupied by pupils that he had scarce breathing space from morn till eve, so that he chose Heraclas as his assistant in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (of which he was himself now head in succession to Clement), to teach the beginners (ibid., vi, 15). Heraclas was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the long-lived Bishop Demetrius. When in 231 the latter condemned <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who remained at C&aelig;sarea, Heraclas became head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Soon afterwards he succeeded Demetrius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. According to Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (in <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a>, "De vir. ill.", xxxiv), when <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> returned to the city, Heraclas deposed him from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and banished him (cf. the life of <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> in Acta SS., 14 May, &#167;21, and the probably spurious "Mystagogia" of St. Alexander of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in Routh's "Reliqui&aelig; Sacr&aelig;", IV, 81). This statement is supported by an interesting fragment of Photius (<em>Synag. kaiapod.</em>; 9), who probably had good authority. It runs as follows (<a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, "Hippol. und Kallist.", 264, Engl. transl. 245): "in the days of the most holy Heraclas, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, called Adamantius, was plainly expounding his own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on Wednesdays and Fridays; the said holy Heraclas therefore separated him from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and drove him from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, as a distorter of the wholesome <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and a perverter of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, thus <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, on his way to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> reached a city called Thmuis, which had an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Ammonius, who committed to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> the delivery of an instruction in his Church. The said Pope Heraclas, having heard this, went to <a href="../cathen/14658a.htm">Thmuis</a>, deposed Ammonius for this cause, and set up in his stead as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a younger man named Philip, who was of great note among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Later on, Heraclas, being besought by the people of the city, received Ammonius again as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and gave the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/14658a.htm">Thmuis</a> to both Ammonius and Philip. But after the holy Heraclas had gone thence, Philip never sat upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> throne, but when Ammonius expounded or celebrated the liturgy, always stood behind him all the days of the life of Ammonius. But when the latter was dead, then Philip sat on the throne, and became one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remarkable for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>." On the identification of this Ammonius with the author of the "Ammonian Sections", mentioned in the letter of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> to Carpianus, see Harnack, "Chronol.", II, 81-2. Heraclas was succeeded in the third year of the Emperor Philip, by St. Dionysius, who had previously been his successor as head of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. St. Dionysius describes the custom of Heraclas in receiving <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without rebaptism, but only after a public examination of their conduct (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.7.4</a>). Heraclas was inserted by Usuard in his <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> on 14 July, and he has thus come into the Roman Martyrology on that day. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> and Ethiopians celebrate his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 4 Dec.

<p>On the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. xlvi) that "until Heraclas and Demetrius" the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, see <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">EGYPT</a> (V). The latest discussion (with full bibliography) is by Cabrol in "Dict. d'arch&eacute;ol. chr&eacute;t.". In close connexion with this question is the statement of <a href="../cathen/05639a.htm">Eutychius of Alexandria</a> (933-40) that until Demetrius there was but one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; Demetrius established three suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, and Heraclas twenty more. <a href="../cathen/05639a.htm">Eutychius</a> adds that one of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, named Eumenius (is this a mistake for Ammonius?), fell into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; Heraclas, having summoned a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, went to his city, examined the matter and brought him back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The people, hearing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> call their patriarch "Aba" (Father), entitled him their grandfather "Baba", hence the title "Papas" given to the Alexandrian as to the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
