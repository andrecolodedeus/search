<h1>Herbert Vaughan</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>; b. at Gloucester, 15 April, 1832; d. at St. Joseph's College, Mill Hill, Middlesex, 19 June, 1903; he came of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which had been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> all through the ages of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Its members had suffered for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in fines and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and double land taxes. Sometimes, too, they suffered for their politics. In the Civil War they sided with Charles I and were nearly ruined. After the Stuart rising in 1715, John Vaughan of Courtfield refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the House of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and two years later his name appears in a list of "Popish Recusants Convict". When "Prince Charlie" in 1745 raided south to Derby, two of the Vaughans rode back with him to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and fought by his side at Culloden. Driven into exile, both took service under the Spanish king, and the younger rose to the rank of field-marshal. The son of the elder brother, the great-great-grandfather of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was allowed to come back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and to resume possession of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estates at Courtfield, in Herefordshire.

<p>Colonel John Vaughan, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> father, married, in 1830, Eliza, daughter of Mr. John Rolls, of the Hendre, Monmouthshire, and an aunt of the first Lord Llangattock. Mrs. Vaughan became a convert to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> shortly before her marriage and was, in many ways, a remarkable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. It was her habit to spend an hour every day in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, begging of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that He would call her children to serve Him in the choir or in the sanctuary. In the event all her five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and of her eight sons six became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three of them <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Herbert, the eldest born, went to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a> in the spring of 1841, and remained until the summer of 1847. From Stonyhurst he went to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at Brugelette, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, for three years. From an early age his thoughts had been turned to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. His mother, writing when he was only fourteen, said she was confident that he would be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. His father's dearest wish was to see him win distinction as an English soldier, but when he was only sixteen he had made up his mind to give himself to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On leaving Brugelette he went to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside Abbey</a> for twelve months as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> student. In the autumn of 1851 he arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to attend the lectures at the Collegio Romano, and there for a time he shared lodgings with the poet, Aubrey de Vere. The student years in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were a time of trial and difficulty. Wretched and incapacitating health made the labour of study a constant strain. In the intimate diary which he kept at this time he constantly reproaches himself for his excessive impetuosity in speech and action. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, at the age of twenty-two, on 28 October, 1854, at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and said his first Mass in Florence at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Annunziata on the following day.

<p>During all his student years he had hoped to be a missioner in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, but at <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman's</a> call he now accepted the position of vice-president at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>, Ware, the principal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> for the south of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He went there in the autumn of 1855, after spending some months in a voyage of discovery among the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Though not yet at the canonical age for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and younger than some of the students, he was already vice-president at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">St. Edmund's</a>. The position, a difficult one in any case, was made impossible when it became known that the had recently become an Oblate of St. Charles and therefore was a disciple of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>. At once he was involved in the controversy between <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> and his chapter which darkened and embittered the last years of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> life. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> was the friend and protector of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, and Vaughan was regarded as the representative of a man suspected of a wish to bring all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of Southern <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under the control of the Oblates. Litigation followed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the Oblates eventually withdrew from St. Edmund's. Vaughan looked back upon his work at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">St. Edmund's</a> with a sad sense of frustration. The disappointment worked in two ways. He began to look for external work in the immediate present and, for the future, he dreamed dreams. He collected money and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in the county town, Hertford, and founded a mission at Enfield. But he wanted to do something great for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since he was a boy his constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> had been that whatever else was withheld he might live an intense life. He resolved to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> himself to the service of the Foreign Missions. <a href="../cathen/11763a.htm">St. Peter Claver</a> was his ideal hero and saint, and his first purpose was to go himself to Africa or <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>.

<p>But, gradually, after many months of indecision, he came to want something which should be more permanent than anything dependent on the life of an individual. A great college which should send out an unending stream of missioners to all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> lands seemed a worthier object of effort. He had no money but he had a sublime <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a perfect <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and he determined to go abroad and beg, and to begin with the Americas. With the approval of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> and the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he set sail for the Caribbean Sea in December, 1863. Landing at Colon, he crossed the Isthmus of Panama, then part of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>. The Government was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were forbidden to say mass or to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> until they had taken an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to accept the Constitution, which required what was regarded as an acknowledgement of the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> in spiritual matters. The churches were all closed and, though hundreds of people were dying of small-pox, they were left to die without the help of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. That was enough for Vaughan. he threw himself into the work, said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, heard confessions, and gave extreme unction without the least regard for the government prohibition. He was summoned before the president and told to desist. He had promised to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> the next morning in the house of a dying <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and to give her <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>. He kept his promise, but was taken before the prefect of the town. His offence being admitted he was required to give bail, and instructions were given that he should not be allowed to leave the port. It was clear that he could do no more good in <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, so, forfeiting his bail, he at once went on board a <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> steamer and sailed for San Francisco. Here, in spite of the limitations but to his appeals for money, during a stay of five months he succeeded in collecting $25,000. From <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> he went back to <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, intending to beg his way through <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> and <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chili</a>, then ride across the Andes into <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> and thence to sail for home or for Australia. In <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> he collected $15,000, and nearly twice as much in <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chili</a>. In March, 1865, he left the cities of the Pacific but, instead of crossing the Cordilleras, he sailed round the Horn in "H.M.S. Charybdis". In Rio he had an interview with the emperor and money came in fast. In June his campaign was brought to an abrupt close by a letter of recall from <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, who had just been appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and Vaughan sailed for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in June, 1865.



<p>In the following March the College for Foreign Missions was started in a hired house at Mill Hill, some eight miles from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. It began in a very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> way. Vaughan determined to keep the money he had collected in America as a permanent endowment for the college, as a fund for the maintenance of the students; and when the growing numbers of the students made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to build there was nothing for it but to beg again. Happily friends came to his aid, as they did in a wonderful way all his life, and in March, 1871, a new college, built on a freehold site, was opened with a community of thirty-four. In the autumn of the same year St. Joseph's Missionary Society had assigned to it its first sphere of work among the coloured population of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. To make himself familiar with the conditions of the problem on the spot Vaughan went back to America, and travelled all through the southern states. He was away seven months, and in that time he visited St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, and Charleston, making careful investigation in each place as to the spiritual provision for the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> race. Shortly after his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> his direct supervision of St. Joseph's College was brought to an end by his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>. But though St. Joseph's now had its local superior, Vaughan, to the end of his life, was the head of the Missionary Society. He may have done more conspicuous and important work in his life, but there was none that was dearer to his heart than the founding of this great college, which is still doing the things he planned. His missioners are at work in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, in Uganda, in <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, in Borneo, in Labuan, in the Basin of the Congo, in Kashmir, and in Kafiristan. In 19190 they gave <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to more than 10,000 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>.

<p>Among the results of Vaughan's first visit to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> must be reckoned a new appreciation of the power of the Press. He came back resolved to own a paper of his own, and eventually bought "The Tablet". It <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a fortunate investment from every point of view. During the time of the great controversy which preceded the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, under the direct editorship of Herbert Vaughan "The Tablet", for services to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, received the special thanks of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Vaughan was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a> on 22 October, 1872. His first concern was for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the proper supply of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the diocese. The seminarians were scattered about in different colleges, some in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and some abroad. When they had completed their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, they returned to the diocese almost as strangers to each other and to their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Bishop Vaughan planned what he called a pastoral <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. It was to be attached to his own house, and when <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students came from <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> abroad, they were to live with him for a year and, while continuing their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, were to be trained by experienced <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the practical work of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> explained that he had no money for building, but 18,000 was collected and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was built as he desired. He next considered how best to secure a regular supply of candidates for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that among the poorer classes there were always boys who, having all re required dispositions for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, lacked the funds <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. To meet the difficulty, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> endeavoured to secure the foundation of a number of burses for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. In the case of students whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were in easy circumstances the difficulty seemed to take another form. With the principal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Lancashire in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, an undue proportion of those youths who had vocations for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> would join the regulars and so lessen the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> thought this difficulty was incidentally met when he had made up his mind to open a commercial college in <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>. Soon after opening <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede's</a> he acquired the Manchester Aquarium, and converted it into a central hall and museum for the college. Four years after this purchase the south wing of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened, and the central block was completed in 1884. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede's</a> has long since taken its place as one of the recognized and permanent centres of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and at the time of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> death 2000 boys already had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> within its walls.

<p>Meanwhile litigation in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had begun between the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders on a number of important points of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and discipline that had been agitated since the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1850; such as the exemption of regulars from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; the right of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to divide <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions cared for by regulars, and to give the newly-divided <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of regulars engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work to attend <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> conferences or <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; their right to found new houses or <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, or to convert existing institutions to other purposes; the right of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to visit canonically institutions in charge of regulars, to inspect accounts, etc. Though <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> was the principal in this litigation, the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> deputed Bishop Clifford and Clifton and Bishop Vaughan to represent them in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the latter being intimately concerned in the matter, as a test case had been a claim of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> to reopen in Manchester a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> which they had once closed. After a year and a half spent in this mater at rome, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Romanos Pontifices" (q.v.) was issued to govern the relations between the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in all missionary countries. When Bishop Vaughan first went to Salford he found the diocese comparatively well equipped in regard to its elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but in most other respects without any sufficient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization. Long before he left the whole administration was placed on a thorough business footing. Strenuous efforts were made to reduce the burden of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> which weighed upon the diocese. The people were very poor, but they gave generously out of their poverty, and before he left for Westminster the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the satisfaction of knowing that the general <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> had been reduced by more than 64,000. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, which formerly had been held every seven years, were made annual. The system of administering the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> through the establishment of deaneries was greatly extended, the dean being made responsible for the proper administration of the missions within the limits of his deanery. A Board of Temporal Administration was formed to advise the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on all matters connected with finance. Vaughan was always eager to identify himself in every possible way with the public life of the people of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, with every movement for social reform, and every crusade in behalf of temperance, or sanitation, or the improvement of the houses of the working-classes. Lancashire soon came to recognize in him a large-hearted citizen to whom the interests of no class or creed were alien. When he went to <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, the proposal to commemorate a great episcopate by placing a marble bust of him in the Manchester Town Hall, at the public cost, was carried without a dissentient voice.

<p>In the autumn of 1884 "a horrible suspicion forced itself on his mind" that every year a multitude of children were being lost to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, through the neglect of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, from the operation of the workhouse system, and through the efforts of proselytizing <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. A house-to-house census of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and Salford was at once undertaken, and every child in every <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had to be traced and accounted for, in whatever part of the country it might have migrated. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> instructed his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to throw aside all other occupations that were not imperative, for the sake of this work, "let them have fewer services in the churches if these were a hindrance in hunting out the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that were astray". By May, 1886, the census was complete. Out of an estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 100,000 in <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and Salford, 74,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were individually registered. Of the children under sixteen no less than 8445 were reported as in danger of losing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of these 2653 were described as being in extreme danger. Then the Rescue and Protection Society was started. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave 1000 to its funds on the spot, and the episcopal income for the same object, during the time he remained in <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>. His example was contagious and the people gave generously in money and service. At the outset the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> issued a public challenge to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> philanthropic <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of the city. Their plea for accepting and detaining <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in their institutions was that the children were destitute. Bishop Vaughan himself boldly undertook to maintain every destitute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child in <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>. Public opinion instantly sided with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In some cases, however, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> were obdurate, and time after time the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> courts had to vindicate the right of poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to recover the guardianship of their own children. One by one the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> institutions were emptied of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inmates.

<p>A greater task remained. The whole workhouse system of Lancashire had to be changed. In the year 1886 it was found that there were over 1000 catholic children in the fourteen workhouses of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and the neighborhood and that, on the average, 103 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children left the workhouse <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> every year. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> report showed that 80 per cent of these were lost to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church. It was no part of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the Lancashire guardians when they placed these children out in service to take care that they were placed in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> did not blame the guardians. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a workhouse child, always part of a timid minority, was generally weak and was easily lost amid new <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> surroundings. At that time <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was far ahead of Lancashire in the fairness of its treatment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Poor Law children. In Middlesex it was already the custom to hand over <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Certified Homes with an agreed sum for their maintenance. In Lancashire there were no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Certified Homes for the children. To create such homes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> would require a vast sum, but his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the inexhaustible charity of his people was once more justified. Two great homes were quickly provided and in each case the certificate of the Local Government Board was obtained. There remained the task of persuading the Boards of Guardians to utilize the opportunity now brought to their doors. It was a strong card in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hand that he could promise that every child handed over to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Home should cost the guardians considerably less than if it stayed in the workhouse. The more economical working of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Homes was, of course, due to the fact that the members of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders who managed them gave their services without payment. Finally, homes were provided for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> waifs and strays of whatever sort, whether they came within the reach of the Poor Law or not. Before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> left Salford the Rescue and Protection Society had caught up with its work and was fairly abreast with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is possible even for one who writes under the shadow of <a href="../cathen/15599a.htm">Westminster Cathedral</a>, and remembers <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede's</a> and the missionary College at Mill Hill, to think that it was then Cardinal Vaughan achieved the greatest work of his life.

<p><a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> died on 14 January, 1892. There never was any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in the public mind as to who would succeed him. Vaughan faced the prospect with something like dismay. He thought the day of his strength was nearly done, and that at sixty he was too old to be transplanted to the new world of Westminster. He wrote privately to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> protesting that the was better fitted to be a Lancashire <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> than the English <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> gave no heed to the letter, and Vaughan was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a> on 29 March, 1892. In May he was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, in August he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">sacred pallium</a>, and in December he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was to be made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. He received the red hat from the hands of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 9 January, 1893, with the presbyterial title of Sts. Andrew and Gregory on the Caelian. One of the first works to which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> set his hand was to try to improve the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by uniting all the resources in men and money of several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for the support of a central <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Oscott. In the autumn of 1894 he took steps to reverse the policy which had sought to prevent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from sending their sons to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Oxford and Cambridge. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> prohibition was being disregarded and evaded, and he thought it better that it should be withdrawn, and steps taken to secure for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> undergraduates such safeguards for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the way of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and special courses of lectures as the circumstances would allow. He lived long enough to be assured that the change for which he was responsible had been completely successful.

<p>During the next few years a great deal of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> time and attention was taken up by a controversy which arose out of the movement in favour of corporate reunion associated with the name of Lord Halifax. Representing a small fraction of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> body, Lord Halifax and his friends, warmly encouraged by certain <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, thought the way to reconciliation would be made easier if what they called "a point of contact" could be found which might serve to bring the parties together. It was thought, for instance, that a consideration of the question of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a> might lead to discussion and then to friendly explanations on both sides. If an understanding could be arrived at in regard to the validity of the orders of the English Church, other conferences might be arranged dealing with more difficult points. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> felt that the subject chosen for discussion was unhappily selected. the validity of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a> was mainly a question of fact, and was not one which admitted of any sort of compromise. Moreover even if the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">orders of the Anglican Church</a> were admitted to be valid, that body would still be as much outside the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> of the past or the Greeks of today. However, he was quite willing that all the facts of the case should be investigated anew&mdash;all he insisted on was that the investigation should be as thorough as possible and made by a body of historical experts. A strong commission was appointed consisting of Father de Augustinis, S.J., M. l'Abb&eacute; Duchesne, Mgr. Gasparri, Abbot Gasquet, O.S.B., Rev. David Fleming, O.S.F., Canon Moyes, Rev. Dr. T. Scannell, and Rev. Jos&eacute; de Llevaneras. The commission held its first conference on 24 March, 1896. When after a series of meetings the process of investigation was finished, the collected evidence was laid before the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Holy Office, who delivered judgment on 16 July, 1896, and declared the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">orders of the Anglican Church</a> to be certainly null and void. This decision was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a>, published on the thirteenth of the following September.

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> came to Westminster he came resolved to build a great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His predecessor had secured a site, but the site was mortgaged for 20,000, and there was no money for building. Few men ever collected more money than Cardinal Vaughan, though to him it was always "hateful work". In July, 1894, he made his first public appeal for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In June of the following year the foundation stone was laid and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had 75,000 in the bank. It was a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of no mean proportions that he meant to build. The design of Bentley (q.v.) combined the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a Roman basilica with the constructive improvements introduced by the Byzantine architects. A little later the sale of a city church which the shifting of the population had made superfluous enabled the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, after setting aside 20,000 for a new church, to add 48,000 to the credit of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> building fund. In June, 1902, he made his last appeal. He asked for another 16,000, and it came. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was opened for public worship a year later, and Cardinal Vaughan was there before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in his coffin. During he last years of his life the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> suffered from almost continuous ill-health. He laboured strenuously to the last, especially in the cause of the denominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He had fought their fight for a quarter of a century and had the satisfaction of seeing the great Act of 1902 safely on the statute books. On 15 March, 1903, he left Archbishop's House for ever. St. Joseph's College, Mill Hill, had been his first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and it was his last; he went there to die and he chose it for his place of burial. He lingered on until the nineteenth of June, when the end came a few hours after he had made his public profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the presence of the Westminster Chapter. When the body was laid out for burial an iron circlet was found driven into the flesh of the left arm. Cardinal Vaughan was a man of strong vitality, and his energies were devoted, with rare singleness of purpose, to one end&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> directness in thought and speech, and had little taste for speculation or analysis. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to win and to hold the allegiance of men, and the touching extracts from his intimate diary which were published after his death showed him to have been a man of exceptional and unsuspected <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>.
