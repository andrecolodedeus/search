<h1>Herenaus Haid</h1>  

<p>Catechist, born in the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>, 16 February, 1784; died 7 January, 1873. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were quite destitute, and Raid, in his earliest youth, was deprived of all schooling. He was a shepherd's boy and had learned from his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother only how to say the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> and to recite the little <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of Canisius. Despite privation and obstacles, he finished his preparatory studies at Neuburg and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at Landshut. At <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he entered (1807) after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity, in 1808. But <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work was not to be his field. His relations with <a href="../cathen/13328a.htm">Sailer</a> inclined him to a literary life and among the first shorter productions of his pen was a treatise "Der Rosenkranz nach Meinung der kath. Kirche" (Landshut, 1810). It was through Sailer's intervention too that he was called to St. Gall as professor of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. Here he taught from 1813 to 1818, and also acted as <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. His ability was soon recognized even at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and he was called back and placed in charge of an important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The exasperation shown in anti-religious circles of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> at his return is the best possible evidence of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and energy. After much chicanery and government pressure he was relegated to a country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (1824). But he ventured to return to the capital under Ludwig and was highly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>One of his most intimate friends, Dr. Ringseis, has paid in his "Erinnerungen" (I, p. 113) a glowing tribute to Haid's labours as a confessor. His life work was the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> course in his church of Unsere liebe Frau, whereby he has merited a place in the history of catechetics. The origin and growth of this foundation is described in his large <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> work "Die gesamte christliche Lehre in ihrem Zusammenhang" (7 vols., Munich, 1837-45). In the preface to the seventh volume he explains the manner in which he was wont to conduct his catechizing. In his simple statements is to be found a complete theory or system of catechetics. He lays special stress on the Roman <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of Canisius. The deep <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> in which Raid, from his earliest youth, had held the latter found expression in his later writings, when he not only edited under different forms and translated the "Summa doctrin&aelig; christian&aelig;" of Blessed Peter Canisius, but also published some of the smaller works and a comprehensive biography of their author. During the closing years of his life he was afflicted with almost total blindness, but he bore his affliction with the greatest resignation. When death claimed him he had almost reached his ninetieth year. An account of a number of Haid's smaller works, not mentioned above, is to be found in the third volume of Kayser's "Bucherlexikon" (Leipzig, 1835), 16.
