<h2 id="ref_i">Connotation and definition</h2>

<p>The term heresy connotes, etymologically, both a choice and the thing chosen, the meaning being, however, narrowed to the selection of religious or political <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines</a>, adhesion to parties in Church or State.

<p><a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> applies the name (<em>airesis</em>) to the three religious <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> prevalent in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> since the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> period: the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a> (Bel. Jud., II, viii, 1; Ant., XIII, v, 9). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is described to the Roman governor Felix as the leader of the heresy (<em>aireseos</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Nazarenes</a> (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs5">Acts 24:5</a>); the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> say to the same <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>: "Concerning this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> [<em>airesoeos</em>], we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is everywhere contradicted" (<a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs22">Acts 28:22</a>). <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (<a href="../fathers/01282.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 18</a>) uses <em>airesis</em> in the same sense. <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> (II, ii, 1) applies the term to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>: "There shall be among you <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> teachers who shall bring in <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of perdition [<em>aireseis apoleias</em>]". In later Greek, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers'</a> schools, as well as religious <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, are "heresies".

<p><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II:11:1) defines heresy: "a species of infidelity in men who, having professed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, corrupt its <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>". "The right <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> faith consists in giving one's <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> assent to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in all that truly belongs to His teaching. There are, therefore, two ways of deviating from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>: the one by refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, which is the way of infidelity, common to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; the other by restricting <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> to certain points of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> selected and fashioned at pleasure, which is the way of heretics. The subject-matter of both <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and heresy is, therefore, the deposit of the faith, that is, the sum total of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> as proposed to our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The believer accepts the whole deposit as proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the heretic accepts only such parts of it as commend themselves to his own approval. The heretical tenets may be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> creed, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> judgment, imperfect apprehension and comprehension of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>: in none of these does the will play an appreciable part, wherefore one of the necessary conditions of sinfulness--free choice--is wanting and such heresy is merely <em>objective</em>, or <em> material</em>. On the other hand the will may freely incline the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to adhere to tenets declared <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by the Divine teaching authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The impelling motives are many: <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or exaggerated reliance on one's own insight; the illusions of religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; the allurements of political or ecclesiastical power; the ties of material interests and personal status; and perhaps others more dishonourable. Heresy thus willed is imputable to the subject and carries with it a varying degree of guilt; it is called <em>formal</em>, because to the material <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> it adds the informative element of "freely willed".

<p>Pertinacity, that is, obstinate adhesion to a particular tenet is required to make heresy <em>formal</em>. For as long as one remains willing to submit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> decision he remains a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> at heart and his wrong <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> are only transient <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and fleeting opinions. Considering that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> can assent only to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, real or apparent, studied pertinacity &#151; as distinct from wanton opposition &#151; supposes a firm subjective conviction which may be sufficient to inform the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and create "good faith". Such firm convictions result either from circumstances over which the heretic has no control or from <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> delinquencies in themselves more or less <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and imputable. A man born and nurtured in heretical surroundings may live and die without ever having a doubt as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his creed. On the other hand a born <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> may allow himself to drift into whirls of anti-Catholic thought from which no doctrinal authority can rescue him, and where his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> becomes incrusted with convictions, or considerations sufficiently powerful to overlay his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. It is not for man, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Him</a> who searcheth the mind and heart, to sit in judgment on the guilt which attaches to an heretical <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<h2 id="ref_ii">Distinctions</h2>

<p>Heresy differs from <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <em> a fide</em> abandons wholly the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> either by embracing <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, or simply by falling into <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> and complete neglect of religion; the heretic always retains <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Heresy also differs from schism. Schismatics, says <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in the strict sense, are they who of their own will and intention separate themselves from the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> consists in the connection of its members with each other and of all the members with the head. Now this head is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> whose representative in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>. And therefore the name of schismatics is given to those who will not submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> nor communicate with the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> subject to him. Since the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>, schism usually implies the heresy of denying this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Heresy is opposed to faith; schism to charity; so that, although all heretics are schismatics because loss of faith involves separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not all schismatics are necessarily heretics, since a man may, from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, or the like, sever himself from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and yet believe all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proposes for our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> (II-II, Q. xxix, a. 1). Such a one, however, would be more properly called rebellious than heretical.


<h2 id="ref_iii">Degrees of heresy</h2>

<p>Both <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form of heresy admit of degrees which find expression in the following technical formula of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law. Pertinacious adhesion to a doctrine contradictory to a <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">point of faith</a> clearly <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is heresy pure and simple, heresy in the first degree. But if the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in question has not been expressly "defined" or is not clearly proposed as an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> in the ordinary, authorized teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, an opinion opposed to it is styled <em>sententia haeresi proxima</em>, that is, an opinion approaching heresy. Next, a doctrinal proposition, without directly contradicting a received <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, may yet involve <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequences at variance with <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Such a proposition is not heretical, it is a <em>propositio theologice erronea</em>, that is, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Further, the opposition to an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> may not be strictly demonstrable, but only reach a certain degree of probability. In that case the doctrine is termed <em> sententia de haeresi suspecta, haeresim sapiens</em>; that is, an opinion suspected, or savouring, of heresy (see <a href="../cathen/03532a.htm">THEOLOGICAL CENSURES</a>).

<h2 id="ref_iv">Gravity of the sin of heresy</h2>

<p>Heresy is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because of its nature it is destructive of the virtue of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Its malice is to be measured therefore by the excellence of the good <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of which it deprives the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the most precious possession of man, the root of his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life, the pledge of his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Privation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is therefore the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and deliberate rejection of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II, Q. x, a. 3) arrives at the same conclusion thus: "All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is an aversion from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore, is the greater the more it separates man from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But infidelity does this more than any other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the infidel (unbeliever) is without the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: his <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not bring him help, for what he opines is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: manifestly, then, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of unbelief (<em> infidelitas</em>) is the greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the whole range of perversity." And he adds: "Although the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in more things than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and although the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are farther removed from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than heretics, yet the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because they corrupt the Gospel itself after having adopted and professed the same. . . . It is a more serious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to perform what one has promised than not to perform what one has not promised." It cannot be pleaded in attenuation of the guilt of heresy that heretics do not deny the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which to them appears necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but only such articles as they consider not to belong to the original deposit. In answer it suffices to remark that two of the most evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <em>depositum fidei</em> are the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and the institution of a teaching authority to maintain that <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a>. That <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a> exists in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and is preserved by the function of her teaching body: these are two facts which anyone can verify for himself. In the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is no room for private judgment sorting <a href="../cathen/06319a.htm">essentials</a> from non-essentials: any such selection disturbs the unity, and challenges the Divine authority, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; it strikes at the very source of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The guilt of heresy is measured not so much by its subject-matter as by its formal principle, which is the same in all heresies: revolt against a Divinely constituted authority.

<h2 id="ref_v">Origin, spread, and persistence of heresy</h2>
<h3 id="A">Origin of heresy</h3>

<p>The origin, the spread, and the persistence of heresy are due to different causes and influenced by many external circumstances. The undoing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> infused and fostered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is possible on account of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> element in it, namely man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. The will determines the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> freely because its <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> dispositions move it to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whilst the non-cogency of the motives of credibility allows it to withhold its consent and leaves room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and even denial. The non-cogency of the motives of credibility may arise from three causes: the obscurity of the Divine testimony (<em> inevidentia attestantis</em>); the obscurity of the contents of Revelation; the opposition between the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> imposed on us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">evil inclinations</a> of our corrupt <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. To find out how a man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> is led to withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> once professed, the best way is observation of historical cases. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, scrutinizing the causes of <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, says: "The proximate cause is, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the mind. The remoter causes are two: curiosity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Curiosity, unless wisely held in bounds, is of itself sufficient to account for all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. . . . But far more effective in obscuring the mind and leading it into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which has, as it were, its home in <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> doctrines. Through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> overestimate themselves. . . . We are not like other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> . . . they reject all submission to authority . . . they pose as reformers. If from moral causes we pass to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, the first and most powerful is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> . . . . They extol modern philosophy . . . . completely ignoring the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">philosophy of the Schools</a> and thus depriving themselves of the means of clearing away the confusion of their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and of meeting sophisms. Their system, replete with so many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, had its origin in the wedding of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (Encycl. "Pascendi", 8 September, 1907).

<p>So far the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. If now we turn to the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> leaders for an account of their defections, we find none attributing it to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or arrogance, but they are almost unanimous in allowing that curiosity--the desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> stands in relation to the new <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>--has been the motive power behind them. In the last instance, they appeal to the sacred voice of their individual <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> which forbids them outwardly to profess what inwardly they honestly hold to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Loisy, to whose case the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili" applies, tells his readers that he was brought to his present position "by his studies chiefly devoted to the history of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> origins and of comparative <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>". Tyrrell says in self-defence: "It is the irresistible facts concerning the origin and composition of the Old and New Testaments; concerning the origin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, of its <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, its institutions, its <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>; concerning the gradual development of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>; concerning the history of religion in general--that create a difficulty against which the synthesis of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> must be and is already shattered to pieces." "I am able to put my finger on the exact point or moment in my experience from which my 'immanentism' took its rise. In his 'Rules for the <a href="../cathen/05028b.htm">discernment of Spirits'</a> . . . <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Ignatius of Loyola</a> says . . . etc." It is psychologically interesting to note the turning-point or rather the breaking-point of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the autobiographies of seceders from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A study of the personal narratives in "Roads to Rome" and "Roads from Rome" leaves one with the impression that the heart of man is a sanctuary impenetrable to all but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and, in a certain measure, to its owner. It is, therefore, advisable to leave individuals to themselves and to study the spread of heresy, or the origin of heretical <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>.
<h3 id="B">Spread of heresy</h3>

<p>The growth of heresy, like the growth of plants, depends on surrounding influences, even more than on its vital force. <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosophies</a>, <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideals and aspirations, social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions, are brought into contact with <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and from the impact result both new affirmations and new negations of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<ul>
<li>The first requisite for success is a forceful man, not necessarily of great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and learning, but of strong will and daring action. Such were the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who in all ages have given their names to new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>.
<li>The second requisite is accommodation of the new doctrine to the contemporary mentality, to social and political conditions.
<li>The last, but by no means the least, is the support of secular rulers.
</ul>

<p>A strong man in touch with his time, and supported by material force, may deform the existing religion and build up a new heretical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a> fails to combine into a body separate from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> because it lacks an acknowledged leader, because it appeals to only a small minority of contemporary <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, namely, to a small number who are dissatisfied with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as she now is, and because no secular power lends it support. For the same reason, and proportionately, a thousand small <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have failed, whose names still encumber the pages of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, but whose tenets interest only a few students, and whose adherents are nowhere. Such were, in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age, the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judeo-Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Judeo-Gnostics</a>, <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaites</a>, <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetae</a>, <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, Nazarenes, followed, in the next two centuries, by a variety of Syrian and Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, by Ophites, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionites</a>, <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and others. All the early Eastern <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> fed on the fanciful speculations so dear to the Eastern mind, but, lacking the support of temporal power, they disappeared under the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> of the guardians of the <em>depositum fidei</em>.

<p><a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> is the first heresy that gained a strong footing in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and seriously endangered its very nature and existence. Arius appeared on the scene when <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were endeavouring to harmonize the apparently contradictory <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines</a> of the unity of God and the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Instead of unravelling the knot, he simply cut it by bluntly asserting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> like the Father, but a creature made in time. The simplicity of the solution, the ostentatious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Arius for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">"one God"</a>, his mode of life, his learning and dialectic ability won many to his side.

<blockquote><p>In particular he was supported by the famous <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a> who had great influence on the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a>. He had friends among the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Asia and even among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Alexandrian province. He gained the favour of Constantia, the emperor's sister, and he disseminated his doctrine among the people by means of his notorious book which he called <em>thaleia</em> or 'Entertainment' and by songs adapted for sailors, millers, and travellers. (Addis and Arnold, "A Catholic Dictionary", 7th ed., 1905, 54.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Council of Nicaea <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the heresiarch, but its <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>, like all the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, were nullified by interference of the civil power. Constantine and his sister protected Arius and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and the next emperor, Constantius, assured the triumph of the heresy: the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were reduced to silence by dire persecution. At once an internecine conflict began within the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> pale, for heresy, lacking the internal cohesive element of authority, can only be held together by coercion either from friend or foe. <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">Sects</a> sprang up rapidly: they are known as <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>, Exucontians, <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Acacians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a> (364-378) lent his powerful support to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/16066a.htm">peace of the Church</a> was only secured when the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperor Theodosius reversed the policy of his predecessors and sided with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Within the boundaries of the Roman empire the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Nicaea, enforced again by the General Council of Constantinople (381), prevailed, but <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> held its own for over two hundred years longer wherever the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> held sway: in Thrace, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Gaul. The <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of King Recared of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, who began to reign in 586, marked the end of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in his dominions, and the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> sealed the doom of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> everywhere.

<p><a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, not being backed by political power, was without much difficulty removed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> heresies which followed one upon another as the link, of a chain, flourished only so long and so far as the temporal power of Byzantine and Persian rulers gave them countenance. Internal dissension, stagnation, and decay became their fate when left to themselves.

<p>Passing over the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">great schism</a> that rent East from <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, and the many smaller heresies which sprang up in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> without leaving a deep impression on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we arrive at the modern <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which date from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and go by the collective name of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The three elements of success possessed by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> reappear in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> and cause these two great religious upheavals to move on almost parallel lines. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was eminently a man of his people: the rough-hewn, but, withal sterling, qualities of the Saxon peasant lived forth under his religious habit and doctor's gown; his winning voice, his piety, his learning raised him above his fellows yet did not estrange him from the people: his conviviality, the crudities in his conversation and preaching, his many human weaknesses only increased his popularity. When the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">John Tetzel</a> began to preach in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> for those who contributed to the completion of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's Basilica</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, opposition arose on the part of the people and of both civil and ecclesiastical authorities. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> set the match to the fuel of widespread discontent. He at once gained a number of adherents powerful both in Church and State; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> recommended him to the protection of the Elector Frederick of Saxony. In all probability <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> started on his crusade with the laudable intention of reforming undoubted abuses. But his unexpected success, his impetuous temper, perhaps some <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, soon carried him beyond all bounds set by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. By 1521, that is within four years from his attack on abuse of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, he had propagated a new doctrine; the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was the only source of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was wholly corrupted by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, man was not free, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was responsible for all human actions good and bad; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone saved; the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was not confined to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> but included all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The masses of the people were not slow in drawing from these doctrines the practical conclusion that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no longer, was, in fact, equal to a good work.

<p>With his appeal to the lower instincts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> went an equally strong appeal to the spirit of nationality and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a>. He endeavored to set the German emperor against the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and generally the Teuton against the Latin; he invited the secular princes to confiscate the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. His voice was heard only too well. For the next 130 years the history of the German people is a record of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> strife, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> degradation, artistic retrogression, industrial breakdown; of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, pillage, devastation, and general ruin. The Peace of 1648 established the principle: <em>Cujus regio illius et religio</em>; the lord of the land shall be also lord of religion. And accordingly territorial limits became religious limits within which the inhabitant had to profess and practise the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> imposed on him by the ruler. It is worthy of remark that the geographical frontier fixed by the politicians of 1648 is still the dividing line between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, more than any other, was the work of crafty politicians. The soil had been prepared for it by the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a> or <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffites</a>, who at the beginning of the sixteenth century were still numerous in the towns. No <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> arose, but the unholy work was thoroughly done by kings and parliaments, by means of a series of <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> unequalled in severity.
<h3 id="C">Persistence of heresy</h3>

<p>We have seen how heresy originates and how it spreads; we must now answer the question why it persists, or why so many persevere in heresy. Once heresy is in possession, it tightens its grip by the thousand subtle and often unconscious influences which mould a man's life. A child is born in heretical surroundings: before it is able to think for itself its mind has been filled and fashioned by home, school, and church teachings, the authority of which it never <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. When, at a riper age, doubts arise, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is seldom apprehended as it is. Innate prejudices, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> bias, historical distortions stand in the way and frequently make approach impossible. The state of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> technically termed <em>bona fides</em>, <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, is thus produced. It implies inculpable <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, a mistake morally unavoidable and therefore always excusable, sometimes even laudable. In the absence of <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> worldly interests often bar the way from heresy to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. When a government, for instance, reserves its favours and functions for adherents of the state religion, the army of civil servants becomes a more powerful body of missionaries than the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> ministers. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> are cases in point.

<h2 id="ref_vi">Christ, the apostles, and the fathers on heresy</h2>

<p>Heresy, in the sense of falling away from the Faith, became possible only after the Faith had been <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Its advent is clearly foretold, <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs11">Matthew 24:11, 23-26</a>: " . . . many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophets shall rise, and shall seduce many. . . . Then if any man shall say to you: Lo here is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or there, do not believe him. For there shall rise <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Christs and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. Behold I have told it to you, beforehand. If therefore they shall say to you: Behold he is in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, go ye not out: Behold <em>he</em> is in the closets, believe it not." <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> also indicated the marks by which to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophets: "Who is not with me is against me" (<a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs23">Luke 11:23</a>); "and if he will not hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> let him be to thee as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs17">Matthew 18:17</a>); "he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not shall be condemned" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs16">Mark 16:16</a>). The Apostles acted upon their <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master's</a> directions. All the weight of their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Divine faith</a> and mission is brought to bear upon innovators. "If any one", says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, "preach to you a gospel, besides that you have received, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs9">Galatians 1:9</a>). To St. John the heretic is a seducer, an <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">antichrist</a>, a man who dissolves <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs3">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#vrs7">2 John 7</a>); "receive him not into the house nor say to him, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speed you" (<a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#vrs10">2 John 10</a>). <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to his office and to his impetuous nature, assails them as with a two-edged sword: " . . . <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> teachers who shall bring in <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of perdition, and deny the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction . . . These are fountains without water, and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved" (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs1">2 Peter 2:1, 17</a>). St. Jude speaks in a similar strain throughout his whole epistle. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> admonishes the disturbers of the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> that "the weapons of our <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> . . . are mighty to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels, and every height that exalteth itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience" (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#vrs4">2 Corinthians 10:4, 5, 6</a>).

<p>What Paul did at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> he enjoins to be done by every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his own church. Thus Timothy is instructed to "war in them a good <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>, having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, that they may learn not to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs18">1 Timothy 1:18-20</a>). He exhorts the ancients of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Ephesus to "take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock, wherein the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> hath placed you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, . . . I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, after my departure, ravening wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock . . . Therefore watch, . . ." (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs28">Acts 20:28-31</a>). "Beware of dogs", he writes to the <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs2">Philippians (3:2)</a>, the dogs being the same <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> teachers as the "ravening wolves". The Fathers show no more leniency to perverters of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writer thus sketches their teaching (Schaff-Herzog, s.v. <em>Heresy</em>): "Polycarp regarded <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>. Ignatius sees in heretics poisonous plants, or animals in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> condemn their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> as inspirations of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>; Theophilus compares them to barren and rocky islands on which ships are wrecked; and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says, that as pirates place lights on cliffs to allure and destroy vessels in quest of refuge, so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Prince of this world</a> lights the fires of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in order to destroy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. [Jerome calls the congregations of the heretics <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> (Ep. 123), and says their communion is to be avoided like that of vipers and scorpions (Ep. 130).]" These primitive views on heresy have been faithfully transmitted and acted on by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in subsequent ages. There is no break in the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> from <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> to <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>.

<h2 id="ref_vii">Vindication of their teaching</h2>

<p>The first law of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, be it the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> of plant or animal, of man or of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is self-preservation. Neglect of self-preservation leads to ruin and destruction. But the life of a religious society, the tissue that binds its members into one body and animates them with one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is the symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the creed or confession adhered to as a condition <em>sine qua non</em> of membership. To undo the creed is to undo the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The integrity of the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> is more essential to the cohesion of a religious society than the strict practice of its moral precepts. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> supplies the means of mending moral delinquencies as one of its ordinary functions, whereas the loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, cutting at the root of spiritual life, is usually fatal to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In fact the long list of heresiarchs contains the name of only one who came to resipiscence: <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>. The jealousy with which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> guards and defends her deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is therefore identical with the instinctive <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of self-preservation and the desire to live. This instinct is by no means peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; being natural it is universal. All <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, denominations, confessions, schools of thought, and associations of any kind have a more or less comprehensive set of tenets on the acceptance of which membership depends. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> this <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> has received the sanction of Divine <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, as appears from the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles quoted above. Freedom of thought extending to the essential <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is in itself a contradiction; for, by accepting membership, the members accept the essential <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and renounce their freedom of thought so far as these are concerned.

<p>But what authority is to lay down the law as to what is or is not essential? It is certainly not the authority of individuals. By entering a society, whichever it be, the individual gives up part of his individuality to be merged into the community. And that part is precisely his private judgment on the essentials: if he resumes his liberty he <em>ipso facto</em> separates himself from his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. The decision, therefore, rests with the constitutional authority of the society--in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> acting as teacher and guardian of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nor can it be said that this principle unduly curtails the play of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. That it does curtail its play is a fact, but a fact grounded in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and Divine law, as shown above. That it does not curtail <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> unduly is evidenced by this other fact: that the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (1) is itself an inexhaustible object of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> effort of the noblest kind, lifting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> above its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> sphere, enlarging and deepening its outlook, soliciting its finest faculties; (2) that, side by side with the deposit, but <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> connected with it, there is a multitude of doubtful points of which discussion is free within the wide bounds of charity--"in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus charitas." The substitution of private judgment for the teaching <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm"><em>magisterium</em></a> has been the dissolvent of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> who have adopted it. Only those <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> exhibit a certain consistency in which private judgment is a dead letter and the teaching is carried on according to confessions and catechisms by a trained clergy.

<h2 id="ref_viii">Church legislation on heresy</h2>

<p>Heresy, being a deadly poison generated within the organism of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must be ejected if she is to live and perform her task of continuing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> work of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>, who foretold the disease, also provided the remedy: He endowed her teaching with <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">CHURCH</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">office of teaching</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, the <em>ecclesia docens</em>, which, under certain conditions, judges without appeal in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> (see COUNCILS). <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallible</a> decisions can also be given by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> teaching <em>ex cathedra</em> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">INFALLIBILITY</a>). Each <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, is in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound to keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his flock untainted; to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pastor</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> is given the office of feeding the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian flock</a>. The power, then, of expelling heresy is an essential factor in the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Like other powers and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, the power of rejecting heresy adapts itself in practice to circumstances of time and place, and, especially, of social and political conditions. At the beginning it worked without special organization. The ancient discipline charged the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of searching out the heresies in their diocese and checking the progress of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by any means at their command. When <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> doctrines gathered volume and threatened disruption of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in councils, provincial, metropolitan, national, or ecumenical. There the combined weight of their authority was brought to bear upon the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> doctrines. The first council was a meeting of the Apostles at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in order to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">judaizing</a> tendencies among the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It is the type of all succeeding councils: <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">head of the Church</a>, and guided by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, sit as judges in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. The spirit which animates the dealings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with heresy and heretics is one of extreme severity. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> writes to Titus: "A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid: knowing that he, that is such a one, is subverted, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinneth</a>, being condemned by his own judgment" (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs10">Titus 3:10-11</a>). This early piece of legislation reproduces the still earlier teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "And if he will not hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>, let him be to thee as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs17">Matthew 18:17</a>); it also inspires all subsequent anti-heretical legislation. The sentence on the obstinate heretic is invariably <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. He is separated from the company of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, delivered up "to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for the destruction of the flesh, that the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> may be saved in the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>).

<p>When Constantine had taken upon himself the office of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <em>episcopus externus</em>, and put the secular arm at the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against heretics became more and more rigorous. Under the purely <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> no temporal punishment could be inflicted on the obstinate heretic, except the damage which might arise to his personal dignity through being deprived of all intercourse with his former brethren. But under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors rigorous measures were enforced against the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of heretics. From the time of Constantine to Theodosius and <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> (313-424) various penal laws were enacted by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors against heretics as being guilty of crime against the State. "In both the Theodosian and Justinian codes they were styled <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; all intercourse was forbidden to be held with them; they were deprived of all offices of profit and dignity in the civil administration, while all burdensome offices, both of the camp and of the curia, were imposed upon them; they were disqualified from disposing of their own estates by will, or of accepting estates bequeathed to them by others; they were denied the right of giving or receiving donations, of contracting, buying, and selling; pecuniary fines were imposed upon them; they were often proscribed and banished, and in many cases scourged before being sent into exile. In some particularly aggravated cases sentence of death was pronounced upon heretics, though seldom executed in the time of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Theodosius is said to be the first who pronounced heresy a capital crime; this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was passed in 382 against the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, the Saccophori, the <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Hydroparastatae</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. Heretical teachers were forbidden to propagate their doctrines publicly or privately; to hold public disputations; to ordain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or any other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; to hold religious meetings; to build conventicles or to avail themselves of money bequeathed to them for that purpose. Slaves were allowed to inform against their heretical masters and to purchase their freedom by coming over to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The children of heretical <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were denied their patrimony and inheritance unless they returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The books of heretics were ordered to be burned." (<em> Vide</em> "Codex Theodosianus", lib. XVI, tit. 5, "De Haereticis".)

<p>This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> remained in force and with even greater severity in the kingdom formed by the victorious barbarian invaders on the ruins of the Roman Empire in the West. The burning of heretics was first decreed in the eleventh century. The Synod of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (1184) imposed on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to search out the heretics in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and to hand them over to the secular power. Other synods, and the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, repeated and enforced this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, especially the Synod of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1229), which established inquisitors in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>). Everyone was bound to denounce heretics, the names of the witnesses were kept secret; after 1243, when <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a> against heretics, torture was applied in trials; the guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were delivered up to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> and actually burnt at the stake. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (1542) established, and <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> organized, the Roman Congregation of the Inquisition, or Holy Office, a regular <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">court of justice</a> for dealing with heresy and heretics (see <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">ROMAN CONGREGATIONS</a>). The Congregation of the Index, instituted by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, has for its province the care of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> in literature; it proceeds against printed matter very much as the Holy Office proceeds against <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">INDEX OF PROHIBITED BOOKS</a>). The present <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> [1909], <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, has decreed the establishment in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of a board of censors and of a vigilance committee whose functions are to find out and report on writings and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> tainted with the heresy of <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a> (Encyclical "Pascendi", 8 Sept., 1907). The present-day legislation against heresy has lost nothing of its ancient severity; but the penalties on heretics are now only of the spiritual order; all the punishments which require the intervention of the secular arm have fallen into abeyance. Even in countries where the cleavage between the spiritual and secular powers does not amount to hostility or complete severance, the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a>, confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">goods</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, etc., are no longer inflicted on heretics. The spiritual penalties are of two kinds: <em>latae</em> and <em>ferendae sententiae</em>. The former are incurred by the mere fact of heresy, no judicial sentence being required; the latter are inflicted after trial by an <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a>, or by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> acting <em>ex informata conscientia</em>, that is, on his own certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and dispensing with the usual procedure

<p>The penalties (see <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL CENSURES</a>) <em>latae sententiae</em> are: (1) <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> specially <a href="../cathen/12785a.htm">reserved</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, which is incurred by all <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, by each and all heretics, by whatever name they are known and to whatever <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> they belong, and by all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in them (<em> credentes</em>), receive, favour, or in any way defend them (Constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a>, 1869). Heretic here means <em>formal</em> heretic, but also includes the <em>positive</em> doubter, that is, the man who posits his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as defensible by <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, but not the <em>negative</em> doubter, who simply abstains from formulating a judgment. The believers (<em>credentes</em>) in heretics are they who, without examining particular doctrines, give a general assent to the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; the favourers (<em>fautores</em>) are they who by commission or <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> lend support to heresy and thus help or allow it to spread; the receivers and defenders are they who shelter heretics from the rigours of the law. (2) "Excommunication specially <a href="../cathen/12785a.htm">reserved</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> incurred by each and all who knowingly read, without authorization from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, books of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> and heretics in which heresy is defended; likewise readers of books of any author prohibited by name in letters Apostolic, and all who retain possession of, or print, or in any way defend such books" (<a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">Apostolic&aelig; Sedis</a>, 1869). The <em>book</em> here meant is a volume of a certain size and unity; newspapers and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are not books, but serial publications intended to form a book when completed fall under this censure. To read knowingly (<em>scienter</em>) implies on the reader's part the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that the book is the work of a heretic, that it defends heresy, and that it is forbidden. "Books . . . prohibited by name in letters Apostolic" are books condemned by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, Briefs, or Encyclicals emanating directly from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; books prohibited by decrees of <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, although the prohibition is approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, are not included. The "printers" of heretical books are the editor who gives the order and the publisher who executes it, and perhaps the proof-reader, but not the workman who performs the mechanical part of printing.

<p>Additional penalties to be decreed by judicial sentences: Apostates and heretics are <em>irregular</em>, that is, debarred from receiving <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">clerical orders</a> or exercising lawfully the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> annexed to them; they are <em><a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a></em>, that is, publicly noted as guilty and dishonoured. This note of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> clings to the children and grandchildren of unrepented heretics. Heretical <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and all who receive, defend, or favour them are <em>ipso facto</em> deprived of their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, offices, and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself, if <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriously</a> guilty of heresy, would cease to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> because he would cease to be a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Baptism received without necessity by an adult at the hands of a declared heretic renders the recipient irregular. Heresy constitutes an impedient impediment to marriage with a Catholic (<em>mixta religio</em>) from which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> dispenses or gives the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> power to dispense (see IMPEDIMENTS). <em>Communicatio in sacris</em>, i.e. active participation in non-Catholic religious functions, is on the whole unlawful, but it is not so intrinsically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that, under given circumstances, it may not be excused. Thus friends and relatives may for good reasons accompany a funeral, be present at a marriage or a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, without causing <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or lending support, to the non-Catholic rites, provided no active part be taken in them: their motive is friendship, or maybe courtesy, but it nowise implies approval of the rites. Non-Catholics are admitted to all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services but not to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.

<h2 id="ref_ix">Principles of Church legislation</h2>

<p>The guiding principles in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> treatment of heretics are the following: Distinguishing between formal and material heretics, she applies to the former the canon, "Most firmly hold and in no way <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that every heretic or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> is to have part with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a> in the flames of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, unless before the end of his life he be incorporated with, and restored to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." No one is forced to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but having once entered it through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he is bound to keep the promises he freely made. To restrain and bring back her rebellious sons the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> uses both her own spiritual power and the secular power at her command. Towards material heretics her conduct is ruled by the saying of St. Augustine: "Those are by no means to be accounted heretics who do not defend their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and perverse opinions with pertinacious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> (<em>animositas</em>), especially when their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is not the fruit of audacious presumption but has been communicated to them by seduced and lapsed <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and when they are seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with cautious solicitude and ready to be corrected" (P.L., XXXIII, ep. xliii, 160). <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (10 Aug., 1863), restates this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>: "It is known to Us and to You that they who are in invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> concerning our religion but observe the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> . . . and are ready to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and lead an honest and righteous life, can, with the help of Divine light and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, attain to eternal life . . . for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . will not allow any one to be eternally punished who is not wilfully guilty" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", n. 1529). X.

<h2 id="ref_x">Ecclesiastical jurisdiction over heretics</h2>

<p>The fact of having received valid <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> places material heretics under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and if they are in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, they belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Their material severance, however, precludes them from the use of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, except the right of being judged according to ecclesiastical law if, by any chance, they are brought before an <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a>. They are not bound by ecclesiastical laws enacted for the spiritual well-being of its members, e.g. by the Six Commandments of the Church.

<h2 id="ref_xi">Reception of converts</h2>

<p>Converts to the Faith, before being received, should be well instructed in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. The right to reconcile heretics belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but is usually <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> to all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having charge of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> a special licence is required for each reconciliation, except in case of children under fourteen or of dying persons, and this licence is only granted when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can give a written assurance that the candidate is sufficiently instructed and otherwise prepared, and that there is some reasonable guarantee of his perseverance. The order of proceeding in a reconciliation is: first, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of heresy or profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; second, conditional <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (this is given only when the heretical <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is doubtful); third, sacramental confession and conditional <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<h2 id="ref_xii">Role of heresy in history</h2>

<p>The role of heresy in history is that of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> generally. Its roots are in corrupted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It has come over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as predicted by her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Founder</a>; it has rent asunder the bonds of charity in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, provinces, states, and nations; the sword has been drawn and pyres erected both for its defence and its repression; misery and ruin have followed in its track. The prevalence of heresy, however, does not disprove the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, any more than the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disproves the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of an all-good God</a>. Heresy, like other evils, is permitted as a test of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a trial of strength in the Church militant; probably also as a punishment for other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The disruption and disintegration of heretical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> also furnishes a solid argument for the necessity of a strong teaching authority. The endless controversies with heretics have been indirectly the cause of most important doctrinal developments and definitions formulated in councils to the edification of the body of Christ. Thus the spurious gospels of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> prepared the way for the canon of Scripture; <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Patripassian, Sabellian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonian</a> heresies drew out a clearer concept of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> led to definite <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And so down to <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, which has called forth a solemn assertion of the claims of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> in history.

<h2 id="ref_xiii">Intolerance and cruelty</h2>

<p>The Church's legislation on heresy and heretics is often reproached with cruelty and intolerance. Intolerant it is: in fact its <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> is intolerance of doctrines subversive of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But such intolerance is essential to all that is, or moves, or lives, for tolerance of destructive elements within the organism amounts to <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. Heretical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> are subject to the same law: they live or die in the measure they apply or neglect it. The charge of cruelty is also easy to meet. All repressive measures cause suffering or inconvenience of some sort: it is their <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But they are not therefore cruel. The father who chastises his guilty son is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and may be tender-hearted. Cruelty only comes in where the punishment exceeds the requirements of the case. Opponents say: Precisely; the rigours of the Inquisition violated all humane feelings. We answer: they offend the feelings of later ages in which there is less regard for the purity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but they did not antagonize the feelings of their own time, when heresy was looked on as more malignant than treason. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which it suffices to remark that the inquisitors only renounced on the guilt of the accused and then handed him over to the secular power to be dealt with according to the laws framed by emperors and kings. <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> people found no fault with the system, in fact heretics had been burned by the populace centuries before the Inquisition became a regular institution. And whenever heretics gained the upper hand, they were never slow in applying the same laws: so the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> in Geneva, the Elizabethan statesmen and the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Toleration came in only when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> went out; lenient measures were resorted to only where the power to apply more severe measures was wanting. The embers of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> still smoulder; the separation and confiscation laws and the ostracism of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> are the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the day. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> said: "Do not think that I came to send peace upon earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword" (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs34">Matthew 10:34</a>). The history of heresy verifies this prediction and shows, moreover, that the greater number of the victims of the sword is on the side of the faithful adherents of the one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">INQUISITION</a>).
