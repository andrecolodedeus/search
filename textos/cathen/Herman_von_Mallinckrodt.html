<h1>Herman von Mallinckrodt</h1>  

<p>German parliamentarian; born 5 Feb., 1821, at <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; died 26 May, 1874, at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. His father, Detmar von Mallinckrodt, was vice-governor at Miden (1818-23) and also at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (1823-29); and was an Evangelical, his highly accomplished and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother (n&eacute;e Berhardine von Hartmann) was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the children followed her creed (see <a href="../cathen/09571b.htm">P<font size=-2>AULINE</font> V<font size=-2>ON</font> M<font size=-2>ALLINCKRODT</font></a>). Hermann von Mallinckrodt attended the gymnasium at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> and studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and Bonn. He became auscultator in the district court of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1841, referendar at M&uuml;nster and Erfurt in 1844, and goverment assessor in 1849. As such he worked at <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, Erfurt, Stralsund and Frankfort-on-the-Oder. At Erfurt he was also for a time commissary to the first burgomaster, and in recognition of his services he received the freedom of the city. In 1859 he was appointed assistant in the Ministry of the Interior, and in 1860 was appointed government councillor at Dusseldorf. In 1867 he was sent to Merseburg against his will, and was pensioned off at his own request in 1872.

<p>As early as 1852 the <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> constituency of Beckum-Ahaus had elected him to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> House of Representatives, and he took part in the founding of the "Catholic Fraction" for the defense of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which since 1859 has been called the Centre. When the House of Representatives was dissolved in 1863, owing to the debate on the military law, Mallinckrodt lost his mandate. In 1867, however, he was elected to the Constituent Diet of the North German Confederation, and in 1868 returned to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Lower House. In the North German Diet he was the leading member of the federal constitutional union. In 1837 he made a speech condemning the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1866) and the annexation of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> and <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and attacked the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of substituting a single (federal) government for the confederation of states. From 1870 till his death he stood at the head of the new <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>, in both the Reichstag and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Landtag, that party gaining strength during the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>. He shared this leadership with the brothers Reichensperger (<a href="../cathen/12723b.htm">August</a> and <a href="../cathen/12724a.htm">Peter</a>) and, after 1872, also with <a href="../cathen/15655a.htm">Ludwig Windthorst</a>. Mallinckrodt was an unrivalled parliamentarian. "Never", to repeat the words of a colleague, "was so much force and dignity, energy and learning, strength of character and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and vigour, united in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as in Hermann von Mallinckrodt." Distinguished and dignified in appearance, as tactful as he was winning in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, clear in his thoughts, honourable in his dealings, of spotless life, and moreover a strong and highly cultivated mind, a mature and grave, though good-natured and friendly, character, and an orator who carried his audience with him by his force, lucidity, and fire &#151; with all this he could not but be eminent in every sphere upon which he entered. Whatever he believed to be right, that he advocated with all his power; and he won the esteem of even his most determined opponents. Even Herr Falk, the Minister of Worship, with whom he had often enough been in conflict, called him "the most honourable member of the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>, a man who had only lived and fought for his convictions." And the president of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Diet, von Bennigsen, also a vigorous antagonist, said: "In spite of his resolute party attitude, he succeeded in gaining and retaining not only the confidence of his political friends, but also the high regard of his political opponents." While he was always an energetic orator, willingly listened to, he rose to the height of his eloquence in the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>. Mallinckrodt took the leading part in the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which he entirely devoted himself. <a href="../cathen/15655a.htm">Windthorst's</a> sparkling wit and Reichensperger's Ciceronian swing he had not. His speeches, on the other hand, are distinguished by a full command of the subject, lucidity of form, and strictly <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> argument. Reichensperger said of him that in a parliamentary experience of forty years he had never known a parliamentarian as serious and conscientious in the preparation of his speeches as Mallinckrodt. The keen force of his words was lauded by his opponents. He spoke for the last time on 19 May, 1874, and concluded with the poetical words: <em>Per crucem ad lucem</em> (Through the cross to light). Death carried him away only a few days after. During all the years of his parliamentary career hardly a bill of leading importance had been debated without his taking a distinguished part in the debate.

<p>A deeply religious man, whom his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ever refined and ennobled, Mallinckrodt also led a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life. His first wife, Elizabeth (n&eacute;e von Bernhard), bore him seven children, of whom two died young; his second wife, her half-sister had but three months of married life with him, and when his children had grown up, she became a religious.
