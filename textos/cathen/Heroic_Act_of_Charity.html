<h1>Heroic Act of Charity</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 December, 1885, and confirmed the following day by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, says:

<blockquote><p>The Heroic Act of Charity in favour of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> detained in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> consists in this, that a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant (<em>Christifidelis</em>), either using a set formula or simply by an act of his will, offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> all the satisfactory works which he will perform during his lifetime, and also all the suffrages which may accrue to him after his death. Many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> devoted to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">B.V. Mary</a>, acting on the advice of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> Regular Cleric Father Gaspar Olider, of blessed memory, make it a practice to deposit the said merits and suffrages as it were into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Bl. Virgin</a> that she may distribute these favours to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> according to her own merciful pleasure. </p></blockquote>

<p>Olider lived at the beginning of the eigtheenth century.

<p>The Heroic Act is often called a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, yet it partakes more of the nature of an offering made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and it is also, unlike a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, revocable at will. This point has been decided by the S.C. Indulg., 20 Feb., 1907, in answer to a question from <a href="../cathen/03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. A special <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> "never to revoke the Act" would probably be binding, because its subject matter is an act of the personal will of which man can freely dispose, whereas he has not the disposal of his satisfactory works in favour of the departed; that depends on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for man it is only a matter of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desire, and only in this sense a votum. It always remains <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> to what extent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accepts the oblation, and it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> altogether lack the power of accepting it. The practice of the Heroic Act is based on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>, in virtue of which the good deeds of one member of <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's body</a> benefit all other members. Its meritoriousness results from the more intense charity (<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His suffering friends) which inspires it, and on which the intrinsic perfection of all our good deeds depends. Its heroicity arises from the willingness it involves to take upon one's self the dreadful pains of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one's neighbour, although there remains the reasonable hope that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and the sainted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in their gratitude, will not allow the punishment to be exacted to the full.

<p>The Heroic Act has been enriched with numerous <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1728), <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1788), and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1852). <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priests</a> who make it receive the <em>personal</em> privilege of gaining a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of their choice each time they say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01348c.htm">PRIVILEGED ALTAR</a>). <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">Laymen</a> gain a similar <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> each time they receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, also each Monday they hear Mass for the departed; in both cases the usual visit to a church and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the intention of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> are required.
