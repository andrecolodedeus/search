<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Heroic Virtue</h1>  

<p>The notion of heroicity is derived from hero, originally a warrior, a demigod; hence it connotes a degree of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, fame, and distinction which places a man high above his fellows. St. Augustine first applied the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> title of hero to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; since then the custom has prevailed of bestowing it not only on <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but on all confessors whose virtues and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> greatly outdistance those of ordinary good people. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, whose chapters on heroic virtue are classical, thus describes heroicity: "In order to be heroic a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtue</a> must enable its owner to perform virtuous actions with uncommon promptitude, ease, and pleasure, from <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> motives and without human reasoning, with self-abnegation and full control over his natural inclinations." An heroic virtue, then, is a habit of good conduct that has become a second nature, a new motive power stronger than all corresponding inborn inclinations, capable of rendering easy a series of acts each of which, for the ordinary man, would be beset with very great, if not insurmountable, diffulties.

<p>Such a degree of virtue belongs only to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> already purified from all attachment to things worldly, and solidly anchored in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/2061.htm#article4">I-II:61:4</a>) says: <blockquote> Virtue consists in the following, or imitation, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Every virtue, like every other thing, has its type [<em>exemplar</em>] in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the Divine mind itself is the type of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> using all things to minister to His glory is the type of temperance, by which man subjects his lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetites</a> to reason; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is typified by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> application of the eternal law to all His works; Divine immutability is the type of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. And, since it is man's nature to live in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the four cardinal virtues are social [<em>politicae</em>] virtues, inasmuch as by them man rightly ordains his conduct in daily life. Man, however, must raise himself beyond his natural life unto a life Divine: 'Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect' (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs48">Matthew 5:48</a>). It is, therefore, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to posit certain virtues midway between the social virtues, which are human, and the exemplary virtues, which are Divine. These intermediate virtues are of two degrees of perfection: the lesser in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> still struggling upwards from a life of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a likeness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; these are called purifying virtues [<em>virtutes purgatoriae</em>]; the greater in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which have already attained to the Divine likeness &#151; these are called virtues of the purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> [<em>virtutes jam purgati animi</em>]. In the lesser degree, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, moved by the contemplation of things Divine, despises all things earthly and directs all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> thought unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; temperance relinquishes, as far as nature allows, the things required for bodily wants; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> removes the fear of departing this life and facing the life beyond; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> approves of the aforesaid dispositions. In the higher perfection of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> already purified and firmly united with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> knows nothing but what it beholds in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; temperance ignores earthly desires; <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> knows nothing of passions; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is bound to the Divine mind by a perpetual compact to do as it does. This degree of perfection belongs to the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or to a few of the most perfect in this life. </blockquote>

<p>These few <em>perfectissimi</em> are the heroes of virtue, the candidates for the honours of the altar, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on earth.

<p>Together with the four cardinal virtues the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Christian saint</a> must be endowed with the three <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, especially with Divine charity, the virtue which informs, baptizes, and consecrates, as it were, all other virtues; which associates and unifies them into one powerful effort to participate in the Divine life. Some remarks on the "proofs of heroicity" required in the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> will serve to illustrate in detail the general principles exposed above.

<p>As charity stands at the summit of all virtues, so <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> stands at their foundation. For by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is first apprehended, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lifted up to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the secret of one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; to the world it is made manifest by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> in which it lives, "Faith without works is dead" (<a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs2">James 2:2</a>). Such works are: the external profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, strict observance of the Divine commands, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, filial devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the horror of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, penance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed, patience in adversity, etc. All or any of these attain the grade of heroicity when practiced with unflagging perseverance, during a long period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, or under circumstances so trying that by them men of but ordinary perfection would be deterred from acting. Martyrs dying in torments for the Faith, missionaries spending their lives in propagating it, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> poor who with <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> patience drag out their wretched existence to do the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to reap their reward hereafter, these are heroes of the Faith.

<p>Hope is a firm trust that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will give us eternal life and all the means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to obtain it; it attains heroicity when it amounts to unshakeable confidence and security in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> help throughout all the untoward events of life, when it is ready to forsake and sacrifice all other goods in order to obtain the promised <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">felicity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Such hope has its roots in a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> equally perfect. Abraham, the model of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, is also the model of the hopeful "who against hope believed in hope. . .and he was not weak in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; neither did he consider his own body now dead . . . nor the dead womb of Sara" (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs18">Romans 4:18-22</a>).

<p>Charity inclines man to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all things with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of friendship. The perfect friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: "With Christ I am nailed to the cross. And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me" (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs19">Galatians 2:19-20</a>). For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> means union. Its type in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is the Divine Trinity in Unity; its highest degree in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures is the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, i.e. participation in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> life. On earth it is the fruitful mother of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the one thing <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the one all-sufficient possession. It is extolled in <a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, and in St. John's Gospel and Epistles; the beloved disciple and the fiery missionary of the cross are the best interpreters of the mystery of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> revealed to them in the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart of Jesus</a>. With the commandment to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> coupled another: "And the second is like to it: <em>Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thy neighbor as thyself.</em> There is no other commandment greater than these" (<a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs31">Mark 12:31</a>). The likeness, or the linking of the two commandments, lies in this: that in our neighbor we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image and likeness, His adopted children and the heirs of His Kingdom. Hence, serving our neighbor is serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the works of spiritual and temporal mercy performed in this world will decide our fate in the next: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom. . .For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. . . <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me" (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs34">Matthew 25:34-40</a>). For this reason the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> in heroic degree have been, from the beginning to this day, a distinctive mark of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the pledge of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in countless numbers of her sons and daughters.

<p>Prudence, which enables us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to desire or to avoid, attains heroicity when it coincides with the "gift of counsel", i.e. a clear, Divinely aided insight into right and wrong conduct. Of <a href="../cathen/11517a.htm">St. Paschasius</a> Radbert, the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> say: "So great was his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> that from his mind a bourn of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> seemed to flow. For he beheld together the past, the present, and the future, and was able to tell, by the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what in each case was to be done" (2 January, c.v, n.16).

<p>Justice, which gives every one his due, is the pivot on which turn the virtues of religion, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, obedience, gratitude, truthfulness, friendship, and many more. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> sacrificing His life to give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> His due, Abraham willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, these are acts of heroic <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">Fortitude</a>, which urges us on when difficulty stands in the way of our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, is itself the heroic element in the practice of virtue; it reaches its apex when it overcomes obstacles which to ordinary virtue are insurmountable.

<p>Temperance, which restrains us when <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> urge us to what is wrong, comprises becoming deportment, modesty, <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstinence</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, sobriety, and others. Instances of heroic <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>: <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>.

<p>In fine it should be remarked that almost every act of virtue proceeding from the Divine principle within us has in it the elements of all the virtues; only <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> analysis views the same act under various aspects.
