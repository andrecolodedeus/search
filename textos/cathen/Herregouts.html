<h1>Herregouts</h1>  

<p>There were three artists of the name of Herregouts, father, son, and grandson, of whom the chief was Hendrik, the son of David, and the father of Jan.
<h2>David Herregouts</h2>

<p>Historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> in 1603; died at Ruremonde. He was a pupil of his cousin Salmier and a member of the corporation of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> in his own city in 1624. The latter part of his life he spent at Ruremonde, where he was received in 1647 a member of the Guild of St. Luke. One of his pictures is still preserved in the little town, but his chief work, "St. Joseph Awakened by an Angel", is at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Catherine.
<h2>Hendrik Herregouts</h2>

<p>David's son; born at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> in 1633; died at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1724. When his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> left <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> for Ruremonde, Hendrik went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to which city he became so attached that he added the name of Romain to his signature on certain of his pictures. We hear of him at Cologne in 1660, where he was married the following year. In 1664 he was admitted a member of the Guild of St. Luke at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> and practised his art in that city. Two years afterwards he came back to <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and was admitted into the guild there, remaining in his native place for some years. In 1680 he was once more in <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and his studio was full of pupils, one of them being Abraham Goddyn. His best work, "The Last Judgment", is now to be seen at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; his "Martyrdom of St. Matthew" in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> is a very fine picture, and in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> there are two important works, the chief of which is "St. Jerome in the Desert". He was employed by the Corporation of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> to design and eventually decorate a triumphal arch which was erected to celebrate the jubilee of the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in the city, and for this work, which was executed in 1685, he was thanked and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the citizens. His work is imposing, as the figures are noble and expressive, and the colouring admirable.
<h2>Jan Herregouts</h2>

<p>Died at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1721. It is uncertain where Jan was born. Some authorities say his birth took place at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, others Termonde. Of his early life we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, the first date we have in connexion with him being 1677, when he was admitted to the Guild of St. Luke at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. He eventually settled in <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, was a member of its guild, held many important positions in its Corporation, and was one of the founders of its Academy. It was there he died in 1721, and his best pictures are to be seen in the Academy, and in the churches of St. Anne and of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. His portraits of his grandfather and of himself are admirable, and his chief picture in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites'</a> church is of the Blessed Virgin and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> kneeling before Christ. He practised engraving and also etching, his "St. Cecilia" being a notable work. He was an artist of distinct merit, and his colouring is particularly good.
