<h1>Herv&eacute;-Auguste-Etienne-Albans Faye</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, b. at Saint-Beno&icirc;t-du-Sault (Indre, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), Oct., 1814; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 4 July, 1902. The son of a civil engineer he entered the Ecole Polytechnique in 1832 to prepare for a similar career. He left the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> before the end of the second year and went to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In 1836 he entered the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Observatory as a pupil. There, in 1843, he discovered the periodic comet bearing his name. This discovery gained for him the <em>Prix Lalande</em>. As early as 1847 he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences. From 1848 to 1854 he taught geodesy at the Ecole Polytechnique and then went to Nancy as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the academy and professor of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. In 1873 he was called to succeed Delaunay in the chair of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> at the Ecole Polytechnique, where he worked and lectured until 1893. He held other official positions: inspector-general of secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (1857); member (1862) and later (1876) president of the Bureau des Longitudes; for a few weeks only, the minister of public instruction (1877); and member of the superior council of public instruction (1892). Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1843, he became officer in 1855 and commander in 1870. He was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with other decorations and by election to the membership of the principal <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> academies and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>.

<p>Faye's fame rests both on his practical and on his theoretical work. He improved the methods of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> measurement, invented the zenithal collimator, suggested and applied photography and electricity to <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and dealt with problems of physical <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, the shape of comets, the spots of the sun, meteors, etc. Credit is given by him as well as by his friends to the great influence of his wife, whom he met on his early trip to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. His religious nature finds corroboration in his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the wonders of the Universe. <em>Caeli enarrant gloriam Dei</em>, he quotes in "Sur l'origine du Monde" and goes on to say: "We run no risk of deceiving ourselves in considering it [Superior Intelligence] the author of all things, in refering to it those splendours of the heavens which aroused our thoughts: and finally we are ready to understand and accept the traditional formula: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father Almighty, Creator of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth". He contributed over 400 m&eacute;moires and notes to the "Comptes rendus, the Bulletin de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; astronomique", "Monthly Notices of the R.A.S." and "Astronomische Nachrichen". His larger works are: "Cours d'astronomie de l'&eacute;cole polytechnique" (Paris, 1883); Humbolt's "Cosmos", tr. by Faye and Galusky (Paris, 1848-59); "Cours d'astronomie nautique". (Paris, 1880); "Sur l'origine du monde" (Paris, 1885).
