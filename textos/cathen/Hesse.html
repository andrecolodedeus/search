<h1>Hesse</h1>  

<p>(H<font size=-2>ESSEN</font>).

<p>The name of a German tribe, and also a district in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> extending along the Lahn, Eder, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, Werra, and the Lower Main and Rhine. The district comprises today the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of Hesse-Nassau (capital, Kassel). The territory of the Hessians &#151; the descendants of the Chatti, who, with the Cherusci, were masters of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> before the Roman domination &#151; was divided during the period of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> empire into several <em>Gaue</em> (i.e. districts &#151; Saxon Hessengau, <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Hessengau, Buchonia, Oberlahngau, etc.), ruled over by counts.

<p>About 350 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was preached in a portion of this territory by St. Lubentius of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, who built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Dietkirchen near Limburg. In the sixth century <a href="../cathen/06606b.htm">St. Goar</a> preached the Gospel along the Rhine, while in the following century <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> (d. 689) preached in the districts along the Main and the Rh&ouml;n. The chief missionary of the Hessians was <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> two counts at Am&ouml;neburg about 722, founded a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> there, felled the celebrated sacred oak of Thor at Geismar, and founded at B&uuml;raberg near Fritzlar the first Hessian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 741, consolidated with <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 774, and also the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Peter at Fritzlar. Commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, his disciple Sturmi founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and St. Lullus the Abbey of Hersfeld. From these centres of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> culture many <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> were founded on the conclusion of the Saxon <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> subsequently made rapid progress among the people. The greater portion of the land was throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; the smaller portion under the exempt Abbots of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and Hersfeld, or under the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (10 churches in Lahngau) and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> (4).

<p>Under the weak successors of Charles the Great, the old constitution of the <em>Gaue</em> gradually changed, and the counts (<em>Grafen</em>) from responsible officials became independent lords. As the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> also acquired much landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, Hesse was parcelled up into numerous territories. Among the Hessian nobility, the most prominent in the tenth and eleventh centuries were the Counts of Ziegenhain, of Felsberg, of Schaumburg, of Diez, but above all the Gisos, Counts of Gudensberg. The daughter of the fourth and last Giso married in 1122 Count Louis I of Thuringia, who in 1130 was raised to the rank of landgrave by Emperor Lothair. As the Hessian nobility recognized him as their overlord, Hesse was thus united with Thuringia. Louis at the same time received the protectorate of the most important religious foundations of the land, and for a period of more than a century the union of Hesse and Thuringia continued unbroken. With Henry Raspe, the brother-in-law of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia, the male line of the Thuringian landgraves became extinct in 1247, whereupon the Hessians chose Henry of Brabant, Elizabeth's grandson, as their landgrave. Hesse was separated from <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, and, after a long struggle with other claimants of the title, Henry established his authority as Landgrave of Hesse. For a large portion of his territories he owed fealty to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; for his allodial estate and the imperial fiefs which he possessed, he received in 1292 from King Adolph of Nassau the hereditary rank of prince of the empire. He chose Kassel as his residence, and from him is descended the present princely house of Hesse, which can thus trace its line back to St. Elizabeth.

<p>By the acquisition of previously independent territories (Giessen, Treffurt, Schmalkalden, Katzenellenbogen, Diez, etc,) Henry's successors increased the domain of the landgraviate to such an extent that it became one of the most powerful German principalities. Hermann I (1377-1413) played an important r&ocirc;le in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Intended originally for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> and surnamed "the learned" on account of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, he espoused during the Great Schism the cause of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The slumbering quarrel with <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> broke out under Hermann's son, Louis I the Peaceful (1413-58), and Archbishop Conrad of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> suffered a decisive defeat at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> in 1427. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the wrangles between the landgraves and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> greatly contributed to disturb <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order, and in many of the numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the ancient discipline had fallen into decay. On the whole, however, the Hessian Church was in an excellent condition at the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>After repeated divisions, all the Hessian lands were reunited by William II. Philip the Magnanimous (1509-67), William's son and successor, at first adopted a hostile attitude towards the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, which soon found adherents in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Jacob Limburg of Marburg and the Augustinian provincial Tilemann Schnabel of Alsfeld. He banished or <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> preachers, and came to be regarded by them as the most dangerous opponent of "the Gospel". In 1525, however, he was won over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> by Joachim Camerarius and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, who wrote for him the "Epitome renovat&aelig; ecclesiastic&aelig; doctrin&aelig;". The recess of the Diet of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> in 1526 enabled him to set up a territorial Church. At a synod of the higher dignitaries of the regular and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> at Homberg in October, 1526, the reform regulations devised by the ex-Franciscan, Lambert of Avignon, were adopted. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> guardian, <a href="../cathen/06039b.htm">Nikolaus Ferber</a> of Marburg, alone raised his voice against their adoption, but his protest was disregarded. At the Convention of Hitzkirch, in 1528, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, found himself compelled to waive temporarily his claims to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> in Hesse. Thus the Reformatory ordinances (<em>Reformationsordnung</em>) &#151; which were of an extreme type, rejecting the Mass, feasts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, pictures, <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, etc. &#151; spread rapidly over the country. Foundations and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed, their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated, public worship forbidden to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. To establish the new teaching on a firmer basis the first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was founded at Marburg in 1527, while the Rituals of 1537, 1539, and 1566, in the composition of which <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer's</a> influence is unmistakable, fixed the constitution of the Hessian Church on an episcopal synodal basis.



<p>Philip's <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> scarcely exercised a perceptible influence on the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and in 1551 Sebastian von Heusenstamm, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, was compelled to resign finally all claims to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Hesse. In this manner was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> almost entirely annihilated. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was also introduced into the territories which were subsequently (e.g. in 1648) acquired by Hesse; only in the domain of the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and in a few enclaves belonging to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (Fritzlar, Am&ouml;neburg, Neustadt) did the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> survive. Philip the Magnanimous divided Hesse at his death among his four legitimate sons, but, as two of these died without heirs in 1583 and 1604 respectively, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was split into two chief lines &#151; that of Hesse-Darmstadt, represented by George I, and that of Hesse-Kassel, represented by William IV. From these two lines sprang in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> some collateral lines, but no member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at present occupies a throne. In contrast to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the first Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, George I (1567-96) espoused the cause of the Hapsburgs. He increased his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> possessions considerably, and in this his example was followed by his eldest son Louis V (1596-1626), who for his attachment to the emperor was called "the Faithful". He founded the University of Giessen in 1607. George II (1628-61) acquired a portion of Upper Hesse in 1648; his brother Frederick returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and died in 1682. Although three sons of Louis VI (1661-78) also returned to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, there was no mitigation in the stern <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> of the land.

<p>Only in the territory belonging to the collateral branch, Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, which became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1652 and extinct in 1834, was the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> tolerated. Landgraves Ernest Louis (1678-1739) and Louis VIII (1739-68) sought an understanding with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a> (1768-90) afforded free religious facilities to the Reformed Churches; in 1786 he granted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> Darmstadt as a "privilege" permission to hold Divine service. General freedom was first received by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under Louis X (1790-1830), who created the present Grand Duchy of Hesse. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary France</a>, the possessions of Hesse-Darmstadt on the right bank of the Rhine were ceded to the French by the Peace of Lun&eacute;ville, a few districts in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> and Nassau being also lost. In compensation Louis received the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, which had previously belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>, and some districts in the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a> and the Bishopric of Worms, and later (1809) three Hessian domains of the German Order, the <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> domain of Herbstein, and the estates of the Order of Malta in Hesse. In 1806 Louis received the title of Grand Duke (Louis I); at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> he received in compensation for the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, which fell to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the old <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and palatinate lands on the left bank of the Rhine together with the towns <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Worms. With the accession of such <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> territories, the existing anomalous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions could no longer be maintained. Hesse therefore took part in the negotiations of several German states, which resulted in the erection of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> "Provida solersque" (1821) and "Ad Dominici gregis custodiam" (1827). In furtherance of the arrangements, the Grand Duchy of Hesse founded the new Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, which was made subject to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. Although the organic decrees of 1803 had created a kind of national Church, they were only partially carried out, and the position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was here more favourable than in the other states of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine (e.g. in Baden). Under Louis III (1848-77), who began to rule during the lifetime of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Louis II (1830-48), conditions were at first favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1854 <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop Ketteler</a> concluded with the Minister von Dalwigk the Convention of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, which ensured for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a greater measure of freedom and independence, but on the other hand made great concessions to the State. In consequence of the opposition of the Estates, the convention had to be withdrawn in 1866. After the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> extended also to Hesse under the Liberal ministries of Hofmann and von Starck, that is from 1871 to 1884. The five ecclesiastical laws of 23 April, 1875, are in their <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> spirit an exact reproduction of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> "May Laws". After the death of <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop Ketteler</a> in 1877, the episcopal See of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> until 1886. It was only under Grand Duke Louis IV (1877-92) and during the Finger ministry, that the church <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were revised, and those of 1875 modified. Under Ernest Louis, who succeeded in 1892, further changes facilitated the admission of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. (Concerning the ecclesiastical statistics of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, whose boundaries coincide with those of the Bishopric of Mainz, see <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">MAINZ</a>.)

<p>In Hesse-Kassel William IV (1567-92) was succeeded by Moritz "the Learned" (1592-1627), during whose reign the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> broke out. His son, William V (1627-37), allied himself with Gustavus Adolphus and was forced to retire into exile. Under William VI (1637-63) the foundation of Hersfeld and a portion of Upper Hesse were acquired by Hesse-Kassel. The succeeding rulers were William VII (1663-70) and then Charles (1670-1730), whose son became King of Sweden as Frederick I in 1720, and later, during his government of Hesse (1730-51), was represented by his brother William (landgrave, 1751-60). William's son, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, reverted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1749, but, when his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> became known, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, in concert with the Estates, with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, demanded that Frederick as landgrave should neither appoint a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to a public position nor permit public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. To these demands Frederick, to preserve his right of succession, was compelled to agree. During his reign (1760-85) the abuse of selling soldiers to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> reached its culmination. In North America between 15,000 and 20,000 Hessians fought for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> against the colonies struggling for freedom. His son, William IX (1785-1821), in accordance with the Peace of Lun&eacute;ville, received rich compensation (mostly in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory) for Rheinfels, ceded to the French, and was granted in 1803 the title of elector. From 1806 to 1813, Hesse-Kassel belonged to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. After the Restoration the greater part of the estates of the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> was assigned to Hesse-Kassel. The Revolution of 1830 compelled William II (1821-47) to give the land a constitution which ensured to every citizen complete liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and freedom to practise his religion. The status of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was regulated by the erection of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine, when Electoral Hesse was placed under the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. The profligacy of William II, the tyrannical rule of his son Frederick William I (1847-66), and the suppression of all political freedom caused an estrangement between princes and people. In the conflict between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1866, when the elector, after a period of neutrality, voted against <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> at the German Diet and ordered the mobilization of his troops, his territories were occupied by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army, and united with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> on 20 September, 1866, since which date they have shared the destiny of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. It now forms with other territories acquired by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1866 (the Duchy of Nassau, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, etc.) the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of Hesse-Nassau. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the government district of Kassel and those of Bockenheim, one of the wards of the city of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, belong to the <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Diocese of Fulda</a>; the remainder belong to the <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Diocese of Limburg</a>.
