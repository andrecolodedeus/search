<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Hesychius of Jerusalem</h1>  

<p>Presbyter and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, probably of the fifth century. Nothing certain is known as to the dates of his birth and death (433?), or, indeed concerning the events of his life. Bearing as he does the title <em>tou presbyterou</em>, he is not to be confused with Bishop Hesychius of Jerusalem, a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>. A monograph on this brilliant scholar, whose fame has been so long obscured, would fill one of the most urgent needs of patristic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>.

<p>The writings of Hesychius of Jerusalem have been in part lost, in part handed down and edited as the work of other authors, and some are still buried in <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Whoever would collect and arrange the fragments of Hesychius which have come down to us must go back to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; for in the last edition of the Fathers (P.G., XCIII, 787-1560) the works of various writers named Hesychius are thrown together without regard for order under the heading "Hesychius, Presbyter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>". About half of the matter under "Hesychius" must be discarded, namely, the commentary on Leviticus (787-1180) which is extant only in Latin and is unauthentic, being based on the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text rather than the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, and therefore the work of a later Latin (Isychius). The collection of ascetic maxims (1479-1544) is the work of <a href="../cathen/07304a.htm">Hesychius of Sinai</a>, and not of his namesake of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Neither are all the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (1449-80) as certainly the work of Hesychius of Jerusalem as the sixth, the authenticity of which is supported by an ancient <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (<em>phi</em>, III, 20, saec. 9). Unfortunately, this collection does not include the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on Bethlehem from the <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, C IV4, saec. 12-13, a gem of religious rhetoric worthy of furnishing the lessons for an Office of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Subjoined to the "Legend of the Martyrdom of St. Longinus" (P.G., XCIII, 1545-60) is the testimony of "Hesychius Presbyter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" himself, that he had found the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Holy Sepulchre at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.
<h2>Method and importance of his exegetical writings</h2>

<p>Judging from the extant fragments, Hesychius must have been a very prolific writer on Biblical, particularly <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a>, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetics</a>. The notice in the Greek <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> under 28 March, in which mention is made of the exposition of the entire Scriptures, can refer to none other than Hesychius of Jerusalem. In <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a> he adheres closely to the allegorico-mystical method of the Alexandrines; he finds in every sentence of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> a mystery of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and reads into texts of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the whole complexus of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in the New. He follows <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in choosing for the enunciative form of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> the shortest possible marginal gloss (paratheseis). His comment on <a href="../bible/isa019.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 19:1</a>, "the Lord will ascend upon a swift cloud, and will enter into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>" is "Christ in the arms of the Virgin". Water represents always to him "the mystical water" (of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>), and bread, "the mystical table" (of the Eucharist). It is this hyper-allegorical and glossarial method which constitutes the peculiar characteristic of his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, and proves a valuable help to the literary critic in distinguishing authentic Hesychiana from the unauthentic. The anti-Semitic tone of many scholia may find an explanation in local conditions; likewise geographical and topographical allusions to the holy places of Palestine would be expected of an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> living at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The importance of Hesychius for textual criticism lies in the fact that many of his paraphrases echo the wording of his exemplar, and still more in his frequent citation of variants from other columns of the <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexapla</a> or Tetrapla, particularly readings of Symmachus, whereby he has saved many precious texts. He is likewise of importance in Biblical stichometry. His "Capitula" (P.G., XCIII, 1345-86) and commentaries show the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> division into chapters of at least the Twelve Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> and Isaias, which corresponds to the inner sequence of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the respective books far better than the modern division. In the case of certain separate books, Hesychius has inaugurated an original stichic division of the Sacred Text &#151; for the "citizen of the Holy City" (<em>hagiopolites</em>) cited in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/03434a.htm">catenae</a> of the Psalms, and the Canticles, is none other than Hesychius of Jerusalem. It has been discovered by Mercati that in some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the initial letter of each division according to Hesychius is indicated in colour. Hesychius must have been generally known as an authority, for he is quoted simply as Hagiopolites, or, elsewhere, by the equally laconic expression "him of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" (<em>tou Hierosolymon</em>).
<h2>Separate commentaries</h2>

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that Hesychius was the author of consecutive commentaries on the Psalms, the Canticle of Canticles, the Twelve Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, Isaias, and Luke (Chapter i?). His name occurs in <a href="../cathen/03434a.htm">catenae</a> in connection with an occasional <em>scholium</em> to texts from other books (<a href="../bible/gen000.htm">Genesis</a>, <a href="../bible/1sa000.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/2sa000.htm">2 Samuel</a>, <a href="../bible/eze000.htm">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="../bible/dan000.htm">Daniel</a>, <a href="../bible/mat000.htm">Matthew</a>, <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">John</a>, <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>), which, however, apart from the question of their authenticity, are not necessarily taken from complete commentaries on the respective books. Likewise the citations from Hesychius in ascetic florilegia, as in Bodl. Barocc. 143, saec. 12, are taken from <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works. The most perplexing problem is the connection of Hesychius with the commentary on the Psalms attributed to him. The numerous citations from Hesychius in <a href="../cathen/03434a.htm">catenae</a> of the Psalms and the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works on the Psalms handed down over his name, particularly in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, are so widely at variance with each other as to preclude any question of mere variations in different transcriptions of one original; either Hesychius was the author of several commentaries on the Psalms or the above-mentioned commentaries are to be attributed to several authors named Hesychius. As a matter of fact <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> clearly distinguish between Hesychius the Monk, author of commentaries on the Psalms and Canticles, and Hesychius the Priest. In 1900 the present writer explained the commentary on the Psalms included among the works of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> (P.G., XXVII, 649-1344) as the glossary of Hesychius issued over a pseudonym. This hypothesis has since been confirmed by further evidence (<a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, <em>psi</em>, I, 2, saec. 12).

<p>A complete commentary of Hesychius on the Canticles of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which are known to have constituted a distinct book in the early <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Christian Bible</a>, is preserved in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>; any edition of this must be based on the Bodl. Miscell., 5, saec. 9. Another codex which would have been particularly valuable for this edition and for the solution of the Hesychius problem, the <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> B, VII, 30, saec. 8-9, has unfortunately been destroyed by fire. The <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> of San Lazzaro have in their possession an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> commentary on Job over the name of Hesychius of Jerusalem. The <em>scholia</em> of Hesychius to the Twelve Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> are preserved in six <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Paris, and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and await publication. His commentary on Isaias was discovered in 1900 in the anonymous marginal notes to an eleventh-century Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Vatic., 347) by the present writer, who published it with a facsimile; the authenticity of these 2860 <em>scholia</em> was later confirmed by a ninth-century Bodleian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Miscell., 5).

<p>Scholia to the Magnificat, in the <a href="../cathen/03434a.htm">catenae</a> of Canticles, and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> establish beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the fact that Hesychius left a commentary on the Gospel of St. Luke, at least on the first chapter. For evidence as to the authenticity of the "Harmony of the Gospels" (P.G., XCIII, 1391-1448) the treatise on the Resurrection must first be examined. This is extant in two forms, a longer (under <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, in P.G., XLVI, 627-52) and a shorter, the latter an abridgement of the former and as yet unpublished. In tenth-, eleventh-, and twelfth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the former, to "Hesychius Presbyter of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" is added the further title "the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>". The works of Hesychius of Jerusalem so far published are to be found in P.G., XCIII, 787-1560 (see also loc. cit., 781-88 for the older literary and historical notices), Faulhaber, "Hesychii Hierosolymitani interpretatio Isaiae prophetae nunc primum in lucem edita" (Freiburg, 1900), and Jagic, "Ein unedierter griechischer Psalmenkommentar" (Vienna, 1906), also Mercati, "Studi e Testi".
