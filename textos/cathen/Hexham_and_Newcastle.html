<h1>Hexham and Newcastle</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Hexham and Newcastle (Hagulstadensis et Novocastrensis).

<p>Hexham, in Northumberland, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, receives its name from the stream Hextold; its old name, Hagustald, came from another stream, the Halgut, whence the adjective Hagustaldensis used by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers. It was founded as an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> of York, in 674, on land given by the Northumbrian queen <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda</a>. When the Diocese of York was divided (678) Hexham was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> for the country between the Rivers Aln and Tees; although, under its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/05240c.htm">St. Eata</a>, it remained for a time united with <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> (founded in 635 by <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>), which diocese extended northwards from the Aln to the Forth. Of the eleven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Hexham who followed <a href="../cathen/05240c.htm">St. Eata</a>, six were <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, among them being <a href="../cathen/08469b.htm">St. John of Beverley</a> (685-705), <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, who, resigning the See of York, died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hexham in 709; and his successor, <a href="../cathen/01093a.htm">St. Acca</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> dedicated several of his works. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this ancient line was Tidfert, who died about 821; no successor was appointed, the condition of the country being too unsettled. A period of disorder followed the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> devastations, after which Hexham <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was reconstituted in 1113 as a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a>, which flourished until its <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">dissolution under Henry VIII</a>. Meantime the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> had been merged in that of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, which latter see was removed to Chester-le-Street in 883, and thence to Durham in 995.

<p>On the establishment of the present <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1850, the See of Hexham was revived, that of Newcastle (where the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is) being joined to it in 1861. The previous <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Northern District, William Hogarth, became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under the new regime, being followed by <a href="../cathen/03551c.htm">James Chadwick</a> (1866-82), John William Bewick (1882-86), and Henry O'Callaghan (1888-89). Bishop Thomas William Wilkinson, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as auxiliary in 1888, succeeded in 1889, and resided at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw College</a> as its president till his death on 17 April, 1909. The present diocese answers to the two <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> and Carlisle, comprising the Counties of Northumberland, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, Cumberland, and Westmoreland. Its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was estimated in 1908 at 179,021, the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> numbering 182, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>) 45, and the public <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> (not counting those of communities), 122. It contains three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of contemplative <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and numerous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutions conducted by religious. <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educates</a> some 300 students, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay; and there is a boys' grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Newcastle. Together with <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady Immaculate</a>, the diocese's chief patron is <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, to receive whose incorrupt body Durham's magnificent <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was originally built; his ring, now preserved at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>, is worn by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when ordaining. Its long list of native <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> includes <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> the Venerable, recently proclaimed <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>; St. Oswald, king and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; St. Godric, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14697a.htm">Blessed Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland</a>, with other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the penal days.
