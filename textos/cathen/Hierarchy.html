<h1>Hierarchy</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Hierarchia</em>; from <em>hieros</em>, sacred; <em>archein</em>, rule, command).

<p>This word has been used to denote the totality of ruling powers in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ever since the time of the <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita</a> (sixth century), who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the expression in his works, "The Celestial Hierarchy" and "The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy" (P.G., III, 119 and 370). According to this author and his two commentators, Pachymeres (P.G., III, 129) and Maximus (P.G., IV, 30), the word connotes the care and control of holy or sacred things, the <em>sacer principatus</em>. The "Hierarcha", it is here explained, is he who has actual care of these things; who, indeed, both obeys and commands, but does not obey those he commands. There is, consequently, a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> gradation among hierarchs; and this gradation, which exists even among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, i.e. in the heavenly hierarchy (on which the ecclesiastical hierarchy is modelled), must <em>a fortiori</em> be found in a human assembly subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and in which this gradation works for peace and harmony ("S. Gregorii Reg. Epist.", V, 54, in P.L., LXXVII, 786; "Decreta Dionysii pap&aelig;", in the Hinschius ed. of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals</a>, 195-6, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1863; "Decretum" of Gratian (Pseudo-Boniface), pt. I, D. 89, c. vii). The hierarchy, therefore, connotes the totality of powers established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the guiding of man to his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but divided into various orders or grades, in which the inferior are subject to and yield obedience to the higher ones.
<h2 id="section1">Hierarchy of order and of jurisdiction</h2>

<p>It is usual to distinguish a twofold hierarchy in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that of order and that of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, corresponding to the twofold means of sanctification, grace, which comes to us principally through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, which are the fruit of grace. The hierarchy of order exercises its power over the Real Body of Christ in the Eucharist; that of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over His Mystical Body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Catech. Conc. Trid., pt. II, c. vii, n. 6). Christ did not give to all the faithful power to administer His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, except in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and matrimony, or to offer public worship. This was reserved to those who, having received the sacrament of order, belong to the hierarchy of order. He entrusted the guidance of the faithful along the paths of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and in the practice of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> to a religious authority, and for this purpose He established a hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Moreover, He established His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a visible, external, and perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; hence He conferred on its hierarchy the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to legislate for the good of that <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. For this double purpose, the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the good or welfare of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is endowed with the following <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>: <ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to frame and sanction <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which it considers useful or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, i.e. legislative power; <li>the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to judge how the faithful observe these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> i.e. judicial power; <li>the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to enforce obedience, and to punish disobedience to its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> i.e. coercive power; <li>the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make all due provision for the proper celebration of worship, i.e. administrative power.</ul> Furthermore, with the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> there should be connected the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exercise the power of order. The acts of the power of order are, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, always valid (except in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">sacrament of Penance</a>, which requires in addition a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>). However, in a well-ordered <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exercise the power of order could never be a mere matter of choice. For its legitimate exercise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> requires either <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, or at least permission, even of a general character.

<p>Ordinarily, also, the teaching power (magisterium) is connected with the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. It is possible, of course, to distinguish in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a threefold power: the <em>potestas magisterii</em>, or the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to teach in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; the <em>potestas ministerii</em>, or the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and the <em>potestas regiminis</em>, or the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, however, did not establish a special hierarchy for the "potestas magisterii", nor does the teaching power pertain to the power of order, as some have maintained, but rather to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, indeed, seems to connect the supreme magisterial power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with his primacy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (Constitutio de Ecclesi&acirc; Christi, cap. i and iv). Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> implies the right of imposing on the faithful a real <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to believe what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proposes. Finally, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, no one can teach without a <em>missio canonica</em>, or authorization from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors, which brings us back again to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. Nevertheless, as a general rule, the "potestas magisterii" belongs to those only who have also the power of order, i.e. to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and cannot be separated from the latter power; the same is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> (Schnell, "Die Gliederung der Kirchengewalten" in "Theologische Quartalschrift", LXXI 1889, 387 sq.). Jurisdiction is exercised <em>in foro interno (potestas vicaria),</em> and <em>in foro externo.</em> The latter aims directly at the welfare of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, indirectly at that of its individual members; the former deals directly with <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and only indirectly with the religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as a whole.



<p>Finally, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is either ordinary or delegated; the first is acquired by the acceptance of specified functions to which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself attaches this power, that the possessor must exercise in his own name; the second is obtained by virtue of a special delegation from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, in whose name it is to be exercised.
<h3 id="A">Hierarchy of order</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> has defined the Divine institution of the first three grades of the hierarchy of order, i.e. the episcopate, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> (Sess. XXIII, De sacramento ordinis, cap. iv, can. vi). The other orders, i.e. those of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, and porter, are of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution. There is some controversy about the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not decide the question, but only declared that Fathers and councils place the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> among the major orders (loc. cit., cap. ii). It is now pretty generally held that the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> is of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution, chiefly because of the lateness of its appearance in <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Its introduction was due to the unwillingness of certain Churches to have more than seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, conformably to Apostolic practice in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs1">Acts 6:1-6</a>). Furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> rite of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> does not seem sacramental, since it contains neither the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> nor the words "Receive the Holy Ghost". Finally, in the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. For this opinion may be quoted <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> in the Council of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> in 1091 (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> "Acta Conc.", VI, ii, 1696, Paris, 1714), the "Decretum" of Gratian (pars I, dist. xxi, init.), <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> ("Sent.", Lib. IV, dist. xxiv), and others; see <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De Synodo Di cesan&acirc;.", VIII, ix, n. 10). This hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin arose at the end of the second and the beginning of the third century, and appears definitely fixed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> (251-252), who tells us that in his day the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> counted 46 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, 42 <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, and 52 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of lower grades, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and porters (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>). In the primitive Church there were also <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and virgins, but these did not belong to the hierarchy properly so called, nor does <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> include them in his list of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Their principal functions were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the practice of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, and of hospitality; while they performed certain <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions, as in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and at the agape, they never took any part, except by unauthorized abuse, in the ministry of the altar strictly speaking (Duchesne, "Christian Worship", London, 1904). Finally, although <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> may confer the four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, they do not constitute a special order or grade in the hierarchy. It is not by virtue of the blessing they receive from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that they may confer orders, but by virtue of a privilege which canon law grants to <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who have received such solemn blessing from a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Gasparri, "Tractatus Canonicus de sacr&acirc; ordinatione", I, iv, Paris, 1893). The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, therefore, counts eight grades in the hierarchy of order, the episcopate being counted a separate order from that of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">ecclesiastical tonsure</a> not being an order.

<p>This latter point, formerly controverted by canonists, is no longer in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>: the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is, in the present discipline, a simple rite by which a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> becomes an ecclesiastic, a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> antecedent condition for the lawful reception of orders proper, and not an order itself, except in a very inaccurate way of speaking, since the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> conveys no "potestas ordinis". In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> denied that the episcopate was a distinct order from <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, alleging that the former is only the complement and perfection of the latter. In respect of the offering of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has no more power than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; on the other hand, it is only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who can ordain a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and this difference of power implies a distinction of order. Against this distinction it has been objected that an episcopal <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> would be invalid unless the subject had first of all received <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, according to the modern practice, one should admit this theory; but formerly, especially in the case of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was different. The title <em>De septem ordinibus,</em> which we read in the editions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, De sacramento ordinis cap. ii), is an addition of a later period, and the council expressly declares that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have a power of order superior to that of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The Byzantine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as a general rule, only counts two grades of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution: the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> and the lectorship. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> implies also the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> of <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> and porter, and <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">ecclesiastical tonsure</a> is given when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> confers the lectorship. The order of <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> is in reality the only one not known to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. It considers the power of <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcising</a> as a special gift of Divine <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, not as something acquired by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. By the Constitution "Etsi pastoralis" <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> derogated from the decision of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, and completely approved the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on this matter (Papp-Szil&agrave;gyi, "Enchiridion juris Ecclesi&aelig; Orientalis catholic&aelig;", <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a>, 1862, 405-7). It is probable that no other <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> were originally known to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, especially among the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek Christians</a>, we meet with many subordinate functionaries, e.g. singers ("<em>cantores</em>", or "confessores"); "parabolani", who cared for the sick; "copiat&aelig;" (fossores), or <a href="../cathen/13748a.htm">sextons</a> who buried the dead; "defensores", who attended to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> trials; notaries and archivists; "hermeneut&aelig;", or interpreters, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to translate for the people the Scriptures, also the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; with these, however, there is not question of orders, but of functions entrusted, without <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, either to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De Synodo Di&oelig;cesan&acirc;.", VIII, ix, n. 8; Gasparri, "op. cit.", I, vii).
<h3 id="B">Hierarchy of jurisdiction</h3>

<p>In the hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the episcopate and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> are of Divine origin; all the other grades are of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution. According to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>, has been established by Christ as the visible head of the whole Church militant, and possesses a real primacy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, in virtue of which he has supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> over the universal Church in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, discipline, and the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This power is ordinary and immediate over all the Churches, and over each one in particular, over all the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and faithful, collectively and individually (Const. de Eccl. Christi, cap. i-3). The government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is strictly monarchical. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are the successors of the Apostles, but do not inherit their personal prerogatives, such as universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIII, De sacramento ordinis, cap. iv). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is bound to establish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who enjoy genuine ordinary power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>potestas ordinaria</em>), and who are not merely his delegates or vicars, as some <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> held. On the other hand, the theory proposed in the fifteenth century at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle, which made the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> subject to an &oelig;cumenical council; the Gallican theory, that would impose limits on his power by the ancient canons received in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and requiring the acceptance or consent of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before his decisions could become irreformable; and the theory of <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>, who maintained that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had usurped many <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which properly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and that ought to be restored to them, are all equally <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and opposed to the monarchical constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">FEBRONIANISM</a>). An &oelig;cumenical council does, indeed, possess sovereign authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but it cannot be &oelig;cumenical without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>It will suffice to mention the now universally rejected opinion of <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and a few other <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, who held that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were of Divine institution, being (in this opinion) the successors of the (72) disciples of Christ. This opinion was defended, in more recent times, by certain <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, by Van Espen, and a few other canonists (Houwen, "De parochorum statu", Louvain, 1848, 7 sqq.).

<p>The composition of the hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the (Western) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is indicated, in summary form, as follows. By virtue of his primacy, supreme authority over the whole Church belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who is at the same time <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the West, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the actual <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> hold second place. They are the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> advisers in the more important matters concerning the universal Church, and exercise their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the various congregations, tribunals, and offices instituted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the government of the universal Church. (For the recent reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, see articles under those headings; and cf. the "Sapienti Consilio" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 29 June, 1908.) Next in order come the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. The Councils of Nic&aelig;a (325), of Constantinople (381), of Chalcedon (451) recognized in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> for the West, in those of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and Constantinople for the East, over the territories included within their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> higher than that of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. The four Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>, as a consequence of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedian</a> invasion and the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>, gradually lost communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but were re-established in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>.

<p>After the Fall of Constantinople (1453) the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> contented itself with nominating for these sees four titular <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> resident in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; however, since 1847, the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> resides in that city. Besides these ancient or "greater" <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> there are, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, minor <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, whose title is purely honorary. They are: the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (formerly <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado); the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the West Indies, who resides in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the East Indies (<a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>); and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> was suppressed in 1751.

<p>In the West the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> corresponds to that of <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> in the East. With the exception of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> (<em>Strigonensis</em>) in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> have a mere pre-eminence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> over <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> are the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (Germany), Prague (Bohemia), Gnesen-Posen and Warsaw (Poland), Toledo and Tarragona (Spain), Rouen (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), Armagh (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (for <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>), <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> (Belgium), and Carthage (<a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>). Metropolitans, on the other hand, have real <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> within their <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, and over the province itself. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subject to their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> are called <em>episcopi comprovinciales</em> or <em>provinciales,</em> also <em>suffraqanei</em> or suffragans. Since the sixth century <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> have been also known as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, which title they share with titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. By this term are meant <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> who administer a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> but have no suffragans, also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> merely titular, i.e. who have no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but only the title of some extinct archdiocese. Metropolitans are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> at stated times to summon <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, to legislate for the whole province.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> come the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who of Divine right administer the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> entrusted to them by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which may determine or in a measure limit their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. If they are not subject to the authority of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, they are known as exempt <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and are directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there are also <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, formerly called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a></em>. These receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, but have no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of which they bear the title. They may be appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> or coadjutors to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In the eighth century there are found, in the West, <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>,</em> i.e. <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> and substitutes for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em>sede vacante</em>. They had no distinct territory and ceased to exist in the ninth century.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> come the <em>pr&aelig;lati nullius;</em> they are more correctly styled <em>pr&aelig;lati nullius cum territorio separato,</em> and exercise episcopal authority over a territory not belonging to any diocese; they must be carefully distinguished from the <em>pr&aelig;lati nullius cum territorio conjuncto,</em> and from superiors of exempt religious colleges, whether secular or regular. "Pr&aelig;lati nullius cum territorio conjuncto" exercise a quasi-episcopal authority over a territory which forms part of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, whereas superiors of exempt colleges have authority only over the personnel of their own community.

<p>In the government of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is assisted by various <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Chief among these formerly was the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, i.e. the principal <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. In time <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> came to be divided into several archdeaconries, the titulars of which exercised a right of surveillance over their particular territory and enjoyed extensive judicial power. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1547-65) limited their powers, after which they gradually disappeared. At present the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> chief assistant is known as his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, an institution dating back to the thirteenth century. The members of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, or canons, make up the council of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in certain matters he may not act without their consent. Where there is no chapter, the <em>consultores cleri di&oelig;cesani</em> take their place, but have only a consultative voice. To the chapter belongs the right of nominating the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, charged with administering the diocese during a vacancy. After the ninth century archpriests or deans appear, charged with the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in their districts; it was their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to enforce the observance of the canons in the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>.

<p>Finally, at the head of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> (<em>parochus</em>), with ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Where <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have not been canonically erected, his place is taken by a "rector", whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is merely delegated, but whose <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are those of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">RECTOR</a>). A few words are here pertinent concerning the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> exercises his immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the various parts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. This is done principally through <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, of whom there are three kinds: <ul><li><em>legati nati,</em> or incumbents of certain <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> to which was formerly attached the right of representing the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (e.g. Canterbury), such pre-eminence is now purely honorific; <li><em>legati a latere,</em> or <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on extraordinary missions or as temporary representatives; <li><em>nuntii apostolici,</em> i.e. ordinary representatives of the pontifical authority in certain countries; they also act as diplomatic representatives with civil governments. When they lack the latter quality they are known as Apostolic delegates.</ul> In mission countries, i.e. where the hierarchy is not established, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> delegates <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, who are, as a rule, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and whose <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> resemble, in general, those of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Prefects Apostolic govern a mission, whether subject to a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> or not; a final category is known as missionaries Apostolic, who differ from simple missionaries in that they receive their powers directly from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and not from a vicar or <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>. When the latter has no coadjutor with the right of succession, he is bound to appoint a pro-vicar or pro-prefect.

<p>In the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the hierarchy in general resembles that of the West; the variations are few, and may be briefly stated as follows. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> exercises its authority over Churches of the Eastern Rite through a "Congregatio pro negotiis rituum Orientalium", attached to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, but charged exclusively with questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> acts also through Apostolic delegates. While the patriarchic organization is preserved, all <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> have not equal powers; some of them are even subject to Apostolic delegates. In the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church we find among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> assistants an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> who is also <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, but has no authority over the priests; an "&oelig;conomus", who looks after the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and revenue of the church, subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> supervision; a "periodeuta" or bard&ucirc;t, charged with the supervision of the churches and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (he has also the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptisteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and altars, and, with the consent of the patriarch, to administer confirmation). The "chorepiscopus" resembles the bard&ucirc;t, but may also give <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to establish a <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> wherever there is a numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city itself he is known as the <em>archipresbyter,</em> or <em>ch&ucirc;ri-episcoupe</em>. These various functions are conferred by a rite resembling that of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (Silbernagl-Schnitzer, "Verfassung und gegenw&auml;rtiger Bestand s&auml;mtlicher Kirchen des Orients", Ratisbon, 1904, 346 sqq.).

<p><em>The Hierarchy of the Anglican Church</em>

<p>The organization of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> closely resembles that of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In its hierarchy of order it counts three grades of Divine institution, episcopate, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>. In its hierarchy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> come first the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, some of whom have the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, are at the head of an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, and may convene a provincial synod or Convocation (see <a href="../cathen/04348a.htm">CONVOCATION OF THE ENGLISH CLERGY</a>). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> rules his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with the aid of a chancellor or <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>; in the larger <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> there are suffragan or <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a>. Chapters and deans of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a> have survived, but are not active in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may convene a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> have also retained <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, deans, and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. At present the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> counts 15 ecclesiastical provinces, comprising 216 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; there are 33 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> belonging to no province, of which 24 acknowledge to some extent the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, 2 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 3 the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 4 the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Australia. There are also 42 suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> proclaimed himself head of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>; but the authority of the sovereign in church matters, even within his own dominion, has greatly lessened. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> enjoys a sort of pre-eminence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Since 1867 a Lambeth Conference is held every ten years at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, to which all the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world are invited. In 1897 it established a "Central Consultative Body", reorganized in 1908, but without judicial authority. In spite of many efforts to unify the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> this aim has not yet been realized.
