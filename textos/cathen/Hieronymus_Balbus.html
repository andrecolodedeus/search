<h1>Hieronymus Balbus</h1>  

<p>(Accellini).

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a>, poet, diplomatist, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07088b.htm">Gurk</a> in Carinthia, b. about 1450 at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; d. there, probably 1535. He was a pupil of Pomponius Laetus, the founder of the Roman Academy. As a young man, by his manner and bearing alike, Balbus gave great offence; he was of a quarrelsome disposition, and, for a time, led a very loose life. But in later years he was highly respected and came to be regarded as one of the most accomplished men of his day. In 1485 he was professor at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. His overbearing manner here soon brought him into conflict with various scholars, and in consequence of the attack which these men made on his character, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1491. A few years later (1494), at the invitation of Emperor Maximilian I, he went to the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, where he lectured on poetry, the Roman classics, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. He was again in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for a short period, in 1495, and visited <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1496, but resumed his professorship at <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1497. Here he became a member of the Danube Society, and lived on terms of intimate friendship with its learned founder, Conrad Celtes the Humanist, at that time professor and librarian at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. In little less than a year, renewed contentions with his colleagues forced him to quit <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Balbus next went to Prague (1498), where he accepted a professorship which had been obtained for him by his <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Viennese</a> friends. But his irregular conduct, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> writings, and disputatious temper soon drove him from the city. On leaving Prague he withdrew to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (F&uuml;nfkirchen), and remained in retirement for a period of fifteen years, during which time he changed his manner of life completely, and even took orders. His subsequent career as an ecclesiastic was one of considerable distinction. He became <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the Cathedral Chapter at Waizen, 1515, later also of that at Pressburg, and, for some years, held an important position at the Court of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, where he was tutor of the royal princes, and private secretary to the king, Ladislaus VI.

<p>In 1521 Balbus appeared at the Diet of Worms as the ambassador of Louis II of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and attracted considerable attention by an eloquent discourse in which he protested against the innovations of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and urged upon the assembled princes the necessity of a joint undertaking against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Shortly afterwards he was in the service of Archduke Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who, in 1522, designated him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07088b.htm">Gurk</a>, and sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on a congratulatory embassy to the newly elected pontiff, <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>. It was a part of his mission also to induce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to proclaim a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the Turk. The address which he made on being received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a public audience, 9 February, 1523, abounded in extravagant rhetoric, but in <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> circles it was considered a marvel of eloquence. Balbus remained in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for some time, and was there <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07088b.htm">Gurk</a>, 25 March, 1523. As a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he enacted many wholesome and timely ordinances, and had the preservation of church discipline sincerely at heart, but he was frequently absent form his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. From one of his letters we learn that in the time of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> he lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for some years in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace and was much in the confidence of that pontiff. In 1530, though quite an old man, he accompanied <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to Bologna to attend the emperor's <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. At Bologna he wrote his best known work, "De coronatione principum", which, on account of the views it contains on the relation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, was placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>, 23 July, 1611. Balbus was the author of many other works. Of these, the poetical, oratorical, and politico-moral writings were edited by Joseph von Retzer (Vienna, 1791-92, 2 vols.). His poems, in part coarse and indelicate, are of no particular merit.
