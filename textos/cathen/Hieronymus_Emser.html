<h1>Hieronymus Emser</h1>  

<p>The most ardent literary opponent of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, born of a prominent <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at Ulm, 20 March, 1477; died 8 Nov., 1527 at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>, whither he went in 1493, he acquired a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Latin, but in 1497 he began the study of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the University of Basle. Through the good offices of Christopher, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Utenheim, he barely escaped <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at Basle for having inscribed some satirical verses of his countryman, Bebel, in a volume which was circulated among the students. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Cardinal Raymond Peraudi of <a href="../cathen/07088b.htm">Gurk</a>, who seems to have been the judge in this trial, shortly after engaged him as secretary. In 1500 he published a mediocre work on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> crosses which were generally supposed to have fallen from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Four years later he began a series of brilliant lectures at Erfurt on Reuchlin's "Sergius vel Caput Capitis" and numbered <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> among his hearers. On account of his triumphs at Erfurt he always claimed the distinction of having been one of the pioneers of classical <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Despite his renown and brilliant manner of teaching, Emser's lectures at Leipzig on the classics, in 1505, aroused little admiration. Disgusted at his failure he turned to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and won the degree of bachelor. George of Saxony befriended him in a financial way during these and subsequent years. Dissatisfied with the methods of teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> then prevalent, Emser applied himself earnestly to canon law, and on the completion of his studies served George of Saxony as secretary. At the request of the latter he composed a Latin ode in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Benno of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, who had just been <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. This <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was largely due to the efforts of Emser at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he went in 1510 at the express wish of George of Saxony, who saw in this solemn act a source of glory for his realm. The life of the new saint, which Emser wrote in faultless Latin on his return in 1512, is worthless from a critical point of view.

<p>About this time Emser received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> and two <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> and <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>. While preaching by command of George of <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, he became better acquainted with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. Emser admired the fiery Augustinian; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, the accomplished <em>litt&eacute;rateur.</em> But in 1519 they parted. At the disputation in <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, to the express dissatisfaction of George of Saxony, who was present with Emser, gave utterance to Hussite opinions of a radical sort regarding the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Emser was deeply pained at this; and on learning that the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, in two semi-public letters, hailed a second <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, he declared in a letter to John Zack that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had reprimanded the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> for their attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and had upheld the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means to prevent division. Emser added a very lucid explanation based on Scripture in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the primacy, and in a subjoined poem dealt a severe blow to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> soon learned the contents of this letter and, regarding it as an attempt to discredit him among the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, replied in his "Ad &aelig;gocerotem Emseranum M. Luther additio", where abuse of all kind was heaped upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Emser answered with an equally violent though not scurrilous work: "A venatione lutherian&acirc; &aelig;gocerotis Assertio", in which he portrayed the certain <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> arising from the words and conduct of a refractory <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. He defended the Scriptures in a very personal way against the arbitrary interpretation of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. The letter closes with a history of his life, which was intended to offset the aspersions cast on his probity by his opponent. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> replied by burning at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> this letter and other writings of Emser, together with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and the "Corpus juris canonici" (10 Dec., 1520). This insult did not provoke Emser. But as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> displayed an incredible literary activity in 1520, Emser wrote eight polemical works in 1520 and 1521 which abound in personalities and invective, yet defend the Faith in a masterly way and clearly point out the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> results of the new teaching. In 1522 he translated the address which the Englishman, John Clark, delivered on handing over to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> the book written by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. (O'Donovan, The Defence of the Seven Sacraments by Henry VIII, New York, 1908, pp. 110-17.) Among other works may be mentioned his German translation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> with a laudatory preface by George of Saxony. Emser showed in this work the liberties taken by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> with the Scriptures and refuted his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>.
