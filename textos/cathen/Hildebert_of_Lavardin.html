<h1>Hildebert of Lavardin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and celebrated <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> poet; b. about 1056, at the Castle of Lavardin near Montoir on the Loire; d. 8 December, 1133 or 1134. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of him until the year 1085, when Hoel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, made him <em>scholasticus</em> at his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Appointed <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> in 1091, he became five years later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>. Some of his enemies, among them Duke Elias of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, in their efforts to prevent his election, did not scruple to blacken his character. The relations between Hildebert and the duke became more friendly later. After the taking of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> by William II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1099, Hildebert was summoned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the king who suspected him of aiding the Duke of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> in opposing the English rule. In 1100 he was permitted to return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. A year later he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, having authorized Henry of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> to preach in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>. Henry made use of this opportunity to spread <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and revolutionary doctrines so that Hildebert on his return thought it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to banish him from the diocese. When new hostilities broke out between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1111, Hildebert was made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Nogent and held in custody, until the end of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in 1113. He was present at the <a href="../cathen/12730a.htm">Synod of Reims</a> in 1119, at the <a href="../cathen/09016b.htm">First Lateran Council</a> in 1123, and probably also at the Lateran Synod of 1116. He rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1120. In 1125 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. In this capacity he strenuously defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of Louis VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who arrogated to himself the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and a dean for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. He also came in conflict with Bishop Balderic of Dol concerning the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over some Breton <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In October, 1127, he presided at the provincial Synod of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, the decrees of which were ratified by Pope Honorius II on 20 May, 1128, at the request of Hildebert. At this synod legislation was passed against incest <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, the conferring of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> upon sons of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> by inheritance (see <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXI, 351-4). When the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> occurred after the death of Honorius II, Hildebert temporarily adhered to the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>. Through the efforts of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> he was convinced of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and became a supporter of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>. Hildebert was learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and always had the well-being of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at heart. Some writers call him venerable, and St. Bernard styles him a great pillar of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <em>tanta ecclesiae columna</em> (Mabillon, "S. Bernardi opera omnia", Epistola cxxiv).

<p>Besides being one of the greatest <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnologists</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, Hildebert is the author of numerous works in prose. His writings were edited by the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurist</a> Beaugendre: "Venerabilis Hildeberti opera tam edita quam inedita", Paris, 1708, and with some additions by <a href="../cathen/02716a.htm">Bourass&eacute;</a> in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CLXXI, 1-1453. But both of these editions are uncritical and contain many works that were not written by Hildebert. The following prose works of Hildebert have been proved to be genuine: most of the epistles (P.L., CLXXI, 141-312); the life of Queen Radegundis (ibid., 967-88; and Acta SS., Aug., III, 83-92); the life of <a href="../cathen/07524a.htm">St. Hugh of Cluny</a> (P.L., CLIX, 857-94; and Acta SS., April, III, 634-48); the <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatise "De querimonia et conflictu carnis et spiritus" (P.L., CLXXI, 989-1004); and four sermons. Of the poetical works at least the following are genuine: "Versus de mysterio missae" (P.L., CLXXI, 1177-96); "De operibus sex dierum" (ibid., 1213-18); "Inscriptionum christianarum libellus" (ibid., 1281-88); "Vita Beatae Mariae Aegypticae" (ibid., 1321-40); likewise nos. 40, 43, 50-54, 58, 63, 64, 71, 75, 79, 106, 110, 112, 127, 130, 140 of "Carmina miscellanea" (ibid., 1381-1442); and nos. 2, 4, and 14 of "Carmina indefferentia" (ibid., 1442-48); probably also "Historia de Mahomete" (ibid., 1345-66), and numerous other poems and prose writings, the genuineness of which has not yet been sufficiently established.
