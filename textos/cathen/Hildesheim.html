<h1>Hildesheim</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Hildesheim (Hildesheimensis).

<p>An exempt see, comprising the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> east of the Weser, besides the Duchy of Brunswick. It owed its foundation to Emperor Louis the Pious. His father had originally selected for an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> the village of Elze (Aulica), but we are told by the legend that Louis was influenced by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to choose the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> site. He erected on this spot the first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. The precise year in which this see was founded is not known; the date varies according to different accounts from 814 to 822. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Gunthar (about 815-834). The surrounding <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were, on the north, Verden, on the east, Halberstadt, on the west, <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a> and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and, on the south, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, of which it was suffragan. Rich donations were made to Hildesheim, some of them by the German kings themselves. Immunities and the prerogatives of independent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> sovereignty, soon brought it a large measure of prosperity and power. The period covered by the administrations of Bishops <a href="../cathen/02513a.htm">St. Bernward</a> (993-1022), St. Godehard (1022-1038), and Hezilo (1045-1079) was one of special lustre. To Bernward's artistic tastes are due the famous bronze doors of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the Christus- column, the Bernward cross, also the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael, still preserved, the western <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of which contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Bernward. The Abbey of Gandersheim, renowned as the home of <a href="../cathen/07504b.htm">Hroswitha</a>, the famous Latin poetess, was the occasion of a dispute between Hildesheim and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> which lasted many years, but was finally settled in favour of the former. Hildesheim obtained its political independence by the severe feud with Henry the Lion.

<p>In 1221 Bishop Conrad II, one of the strongest personalities in thirteenth-century <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, was invested with princely authority, and in 1235 his authority as territorial lord was recognized at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. But he found the exercise of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and territorial sovereignty restricted by the corporate independence of the town of Hildesheim, which endured until the middle of the thirteenth century (earliest municipal constitution, 1249), and of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter; the latter, thanks to the "Great Privilege" of Bishop Adelog, maintained since 1170 a far-reaching right of participation in the government; the year 1216 saw the first "Wahlkapitulation"; while in 1221 all participation in the selection of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was finally taken away from the great officers, or <em>Ministeriales,</em> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The close combination of spiritual and temporal authority meant for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> countless sources of disorder and of violent conflict with domestic and foreign adversaries, chief among whom were the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>. The victory of Gernard over Duke Magnus of Brunswick and his ally at Dinklar in 1367 is well known. These incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and agitations paralysed religious growth. Bishop Magnus (1424-52) having determined to restore domestic concord, entered into various treaties with neighbouring principalities and towns for the safeguarding of peace, and took up energetically the reform of internal <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils had so long advocated. Johannes Busch, Provost of the Augustinians, laboured efficiently for monastic reforms; and about this time the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Bursfeld began their reformatory work in the diocese. <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> arrived at Hildesheim in 1451. But the reforms were not lasting. The old troubles of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and internal feuds, broke out anew and with greater <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> than before, until at length the once flourishing see fell a victim to what is known as the "great <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>" (<em>grosse Stiftsfehde</em>). Of its eleven districts, with twenty-seven counties and twenty-one castles, only the three districts of Peine, Steuerwald, and Marienburg, the so-called "small <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>", were left to the See of Hildesheim by the compact of Quedlinburg, in 1523; the "large diocese" fell into the hands of the victorious <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> and the once great power of the Bishops of Hildesheim passed away. Internal conflicts prepared the way for the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>Bishop Valentine strove to strengthen the ancient Faith among his people by calling a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in 1539, at which he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a number of decrees; but in vain. In 1542 the city of Hildesheim adopted the new doctrines, and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Dukes of Brunswick introduced the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> into the "large diocese". <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was vigorously defended by the <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, Balthasar, from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but the city government had recourse to measures of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Amid these disturbances an old man of ninety was erecting in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> one of the handsomest monuments of the early German <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. This was Canon Arnold Fridag, who put up the magnificent lectern (<em>Lettner</em>) with its rich pictorial ornament. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> entered on the most critical period of its history, when a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> prince, Duke Friedrich of Holstein, ascended the episcopal throne in 1551. His premature death saved the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from total disaster. Thanks to his truly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> successor, Burchard, the ancient Faith and the few remaining properties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were preserved. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, after his death, resorted to the only expedient available for ensuring the stability of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion therein, by entrusting the small diocese to a powerful <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> prince. From 1573 to 1761, with but a short interruption, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were chosen from the ducal House of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, which, in order more efficiently to combat the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, kept other sees constantly under its control, among them Cologne itself. They also brought the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Hildesheim at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>.

<p>By this time the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> had brought manifold burdens and afflictions on the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Even the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was for a short time, in 1634, given over to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> worship by victorious enemies. The see continued to exist, however, though surrounded by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> territory. In 1643 the "large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>", which had been lost in 1523, was regained, though all attempts to win back the population to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was frustrated by the "Normal Year" article of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, i.e. what had been <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> down to 1624 was in the future to remain so. The "large diocese" remained united to Hildesheim until, in 1803, "secularization" severed the prince's crown from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, and suppressed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> chapter and numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. In 1803 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was given to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> as a secular principality. In 1807 it became part of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> under Jerome Bonaparte, and in 1813 it was incorporated with the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. In 1824 the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Impensa Romanorum Pontificum" gave its present form to this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, henceforth deprived of all temporal power, and brought within its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> all the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> east of the Weser. In 1834 the Duchy of Brunswick was added. The new see has an area of about 540 square miles. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> restorer of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was Bishop Edward Jacob, who by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and self-sacrifice accomplished great results. He was aided by the personal goodwill of King George V of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, as well as by the general upward movement of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He introduced the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the Augustinians into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, also the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, whom he summoned from <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (since 1906) is Dr. Adolf Bertram. The diocese numbers (1908) 201,914 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (without counting soldiers or the inmates of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>). It is divided into 15 deaneries and contains 109 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 25 <em>Kuratien,</em> 174 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> numbers 233 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 4 Augustinian, and 8 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. There are <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Duderstadt, with 37 professed and 18 lay <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, besides 8 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; also <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> at Hildesheim (mother-house), with 35 establishments, numbering 308 professed <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 33 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>.
