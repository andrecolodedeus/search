<h1>Hillel</h1>  

<p>A famous Jewish rabbi who lived about 70 B.C.-A.D. 10. Our only source of information concerning him is the Talmud, from which the following account of Hillel's career can be gathered. He was born in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, and was a descendent of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. Although he lived in poor circumstances, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's Law</a> prompted him to devote himself to its study while yet in Babylon. Out of the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, he went, at the age of forty it is said, to Jerusalem, where Shemaiah and Abtalion were at the time the leading teachers. In the Holy City he hired himself as a day-labourer to earn his own living and that of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and also to meet the expenses of receiving instruction. He thus spent the next forty years of his life, with the result that he understood, we are told, all languages, including those of the inanimate and of the brute creation, and of the demons themselves. Some time after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion, Hillel was recognized as the best jurist of the day, and was so regarded during the last forty years of his life. He is also represented as the head of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> with the title of <em>Nasi</em> (prince), as the founder of a lenient <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, in usual opposition to the stricter <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/13751a.htm">Shammai</a>, as the author of seven hermeneutic rules, as the framer of certain decrees which happily accommodated some points of the Law to the changed circumstances of his age, as the ancestor of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> who stood at the head of Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> till about the fifth century of our era. Hillel was surnamed "the Great", and also "the Elder", and over his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> were uttered the words "Oh the gentle! Oh the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>! Oh the disciple of Esdras!" Several anecdotes illustrating his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Law and his wonderful patience are embodied in the Talmud. Among the sayings ascribed to him, the following are particularly worthy of notice: "Whatever is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> to thee, do not unto thy fellow man: this is the whole Law; the rest is mere commentary"; "Be of the disciples of Aaron; loving peace and pursuing peace; loving <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and bringing them near to the Torah."

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a good deal of what is contained in the Talmudic account of Hillel's career is unhistorical; for example, the division of his life into three periods of forty years each; his presidency of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>; his understanding of all languages, etc. When all this has been duly deducted, however, one cannot help feeling that he finds himself in presence of a strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, of a character stamped with unusual sweetness and elevation. Again, when all Hillel's good deeds and wise sayings are closely examined, one can readily see that he was in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> simply a rabbi, perhaps the cleverest and best of the rabbis of his day: a Jewish casuist rather than a moralist; a man who, for personal character and spiritual insight and permanent influence, cannot in any way compare with, much less equal or surpass, as some have affirmed of late, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Light, and Saviour of the World. It has been ably argued that the <em>Pollion</em> referred to a few times by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> is Hillel under a Greek name.
