<h1>Hincmar</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>; born in 806; died at Epernay on 21 December, 882. Descended from a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the West Franks, he received an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the Abbey of St-Denis, under the direction of the Abbot Hilduin. When the latter came to the court of the Emperor Louis the Pious in 822 as court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Hincmar accompanied him thither, and by actual experience became acquainted with the political as well as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of the empire, in all its ramifications. He also followed Hilduin into banishment at <a href="../cathen/04402a.htm">Corvey</a>, and returned with him later to St-Denis. Hincmar used his influence with the emperor on behalf of the banished <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and not without success: for he stood in high favour with Louis the Pious, having always been a faithful adherent of his, and his loyal champion through all his vicissitudes. After his return from Corvey, Hincmar resided for a time in St-Denis, where he pursued his studies with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success, and afterwards at the imperial court, where he was active in political as well as spiritual affairs. In the year 840 King Charles the Bald called Hincmar into his service permanently; and from that time he was the monarch's skilful and efficient counsellor in all matters. A few years later (845) he was raised to the Archiepiscopal See of Reims at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>. Ebbo, the occupant of this important see, was deposed at a Synod of Diedenhofen (Thioville) in 835; it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he had returned to Reims on the death of Louis the Pious in 840, and had again undertaken the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, performing many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions; but in May, 841, he was again expelled, and afterwards (844), at the instance of <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a>, was admitted to lay communion only. Accordingly, on 18 April, 845, Hincmar was chosen as his successor and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Reims on 3 May. The Emperor Lothair I, being hostile to Hincmar, induced <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a> to order a new investigation into the case of Ebbo; however the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> came out of the inquiry triumphantly, and <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Pope Leo IV</a> conferred the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on him.

<p>Henceforward for nearly forty years Hincmar remained at the very centre of government, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political, in the West-Frankish Empire; he was a decisive factor in all the more important transactions, and the numerous disputes spoken of in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> in the second half of the ninth century for the most part centre around the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Reims. Although Hincmar was generally recognized as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, owing to his investiture with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> by <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a>, his opponents, especially the Emperor Lothair and his courtiers, still made use of the affair of Ebbo in order to ruin Hincmar. Hincmar looked upon the restoration of Ebbo in 840 as null and void, and on that account even forbade the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Ebbo at that period, to exercise any spiritual functions. These <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, however, brought their case before the Synod of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, in 853. Here again the much-vexed question of Ebbo's deposition and Hincmar's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was investigated; and the synod declared that the ordinations by Ebbo after his alleged restoration were null; nevertheless, at the request of King Charles, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in question were again admitted to communion. Hincmar wished to receive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> confirmation of this decision; but <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> refused this favour; and it was not until 855 that his successor, <a href="../cathen/02427e.htm">Benedict III</a>, confirmed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> renewed it in 863, adding the clause: "provided that Hincmar was in no wise disobedient to the mandates of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>".

<p>Shortly afterwards, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received from various quarters reports of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> which had been done to the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; and Charles the Bald interested himself on behalf of one of them, named Wulfad. At this time <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> wrote to Hincmar and to the other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, calling upon them to arrange for a new synod, in order to examine the case once more. Soon afterwards, King Charles conferred the vacant Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> upon Wulfad. The new synod was opened at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, 16 August, 866. It was very mild in its treatment of the deposed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of Reims, and acting on its advice the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> restored Wulfad and his companions, enjoining them, however, to show deference and obedience to Hincmar. In his letter of 6 December, 866, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had spoken his mind pretty forcibly to Hincmar about his whole conduct; the latter replied in a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> letter (867) and informed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that he had immediately restored the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in question. Another matter in which Hincmar took a leading part was the controversy about the teachings of <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">GOTTSCHALK OF ORBAIS</a>) concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. After being condemned at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 848, <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> was sent to Hincmar, who kept him in custody, under his own eyes at Reims. In 849 a synod took place at Quierzy, at which <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> was once more condemned. Hincmar wrote a treatise on the question of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and at the new Synod of Quierzy, in 853, he laid before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> his celebrated four chapters on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which, however, were attacked by Prudentius of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> as well as by Remigius of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The Synod of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> in 855 also published canons in opposition to Hincmar's views; whereupon the latter wrote his first book, "De Pr&aelig;destinatione" (857-8), which, however, has not come down to us.

<p>After the great Synod of Savoni&egrave;res near Toul (859), which was also attended by Hincmar, he wrote his second diffuse and prolix work on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. His four theses, which he also advocated before the Synod of Toucy in 860, are as follows: <ul><li>(1) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all men; <li>(2) The will remains free after the fall of man, but must be liberated and sanctified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a>; <li>(3) <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Divine Predestination</a> foreordains that, out of the <em>massa perditionis</em>, a few shall be brought to eternal life, out of mercy; <li>(4) Christ died for us all.</ul>

<p>After the Synod of Toucy, the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> conflict between Hincmar and the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> quieted down. Still another controversy arose out of this dispute; Hincmar disapproved of the phrase <em>Trina Deitas</em>, which occurred in a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in the office of several <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and forbade these words to be sung in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> attacked him on this account and accused him of <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>. Hincmar answered with his essay, "De una et non trina deitate". <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> did not seek reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but it is not clear whether the charge of cruelty which was brought against Hincmar by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a>, referred to his treatment of <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> or not.

<p>On account of the rude assertion of his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, Hincmar got into a quarrel with two of his suffragans, as well as with <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a> had many reasons for being dissatisfied with his suffragan Rothadius of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>; and the latter in return made charges against Hincmar. Rothadius had deposed a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for grave reasons; whereon Hincmar had reinstated the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and had his successor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. The matter came up for discussion at the Synod of Pistres, in the <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Diocese of Rouen</a>, in 862, and Rothadius was deposed. He appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and at the same time asked his advocates at the synod to defend him. From this Hincmar concluded that the deposed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had abandoned his appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the synod (which was continued at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>) deposed him again. Thereupon, <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> took energetic action against Hincmar, because he had slighted the appeal to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and also because the deposition of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as a <em>causa major</em> was a matter which must be brought before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself. When Rothadius at length reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after having had every imaginable difficulty placed in his way, he was restored to his episcopal office by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 865. Similarly Hincmar quarrelled with his nephew, <a href="../cathen/07357a.htm">Hincmar the Younger</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon. The <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidorian decretals</a> play a large part in the letters and essays, which were written in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in connexion with these disputes.

<p>In politics, Hincmar was a strong supporter of Charles the Bald. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the furtherance of her influence led him persistently to work for a close alliance between the episcopate and the royal power in order thereby to secure the support of the king against the nobles. In the quarrels between Charles the Bald and Lothair, he used all his influence on behalf of the former. When Louis the German made his victorious march into the West Frankish kingdom in 858, Hincmar boldly opposed Louis, organized and directed the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> against him, and took a prominent part in the peace negotiations at Coblenz in 860. In this crisis Hincmar saved Charles's crown. When King Lothair II repudiated his wife Theutberga and married Waldrade, Hincmar attacked him in an admirable polemical letter "De divortio Lotharii". After the death of this king in 869 Hincmar took a prominent part in making Charles the Bald the successor of Lothair, and he himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Charles king in <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, in spite of the objections of <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Pope Adrian II</a> in favour of Emperor Louis II. Hincmar on this occasion <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> opposed the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Afterwards differences arose between Hincmar and Charles, because the former disapproved of Charles's journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the crowning of Charles the Bald as emperor.

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> in 875 the emperor summoned a great synod at Ponthion, which met in June, 876, and at which the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> was read, appointing Ansegis, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Gaul and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Hincmar, the recognized chief <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the West Frankish kingdom, and nearly all the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> made an energetic protest against this, and refused to recognize the vicar, so that the latter could not exercise the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which had been conferred upon him. In defence of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Hincmar wrote his treatise "De jure metropolitanorum". After the death of Charles the Bald, 877, Hincmar still exercised his far-reaching influence under the succeeding <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> monarchs of the West Franks. He sought to prevent the decay of the kingdom. At the Synods of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> (878) and Fismes (881) he took a prominent part, and endeavoured to strengthen the political and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the empire by several writings. Owing to an invasion of the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> in 882, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire to Epernay, where he died. Though ambitious and stern he was an energetic, learned, and able <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. His writings (to those already mentioned must be added his "Annales" of the years 861-82) are to be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXXV-CXXVI.
