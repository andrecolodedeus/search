<h1>Hincmar</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon; died 879. In the beginning of 858 the younger Hincmar, a nephew on the mother's side of the famous <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a>, was elevated by his uncle's favour to the See of Laon, a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. He received in addition an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and an office at the Court of Charles the Bald. His ambitious, overbearing, and violent disposition soon brought him into conflict not only with the king, but with his uncle and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. To free himself from the authority of the latter he invoked the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">decretals of the Pseudo-Isidore</a>. Charles the Bald took from the younger Hincmar his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and his court office, and sequestrated the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but the latter measure aroused the protest of the <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">elder Hincmar</a> himself. A reconciliation took place at the Diet of Pistres in 869. A new quarrel broke out at the Synod of Verberie and resulted in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of Hincmar. He placed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, but this was set aside by his uncle. He appealed to <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> and laid before that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> severe accusations against his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and his king, based on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statement of facts. This appeal, however, was not pursued with vigour. The complete estrangement between the two Hincmars was evident at the Diets of Gondreville and Attigny, in 870. Each of them now appealed to various canons, in order to justify his position. In spite of his renewed appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Hincmar of Laon was deposed at the Synod of Douci, in 871, in punishment of his conduct towards the king and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. But <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> did not sanction this step, and refrained from appointing a successor. It was only in 875, when Charles the Bald was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor, that <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> confirmed the removal of Hincmar, and that Hadenulf was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon. In the meantime Charles succeeded in preventing Hincmar from going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and even confined him for a while in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he was deprived of his sight by a brother-in-law of the king.

<p>When, in 878, <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> presided in person over the Synod of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, the younger Hincmar presented to him in writing a complaint against his <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">uncle of Reims</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then mitigated his condition by allowing him to celebrate again the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> and by granting him a portion of the revenues yielded by the See of Laon. The writings of Hincmar of Laon are in P.L. CXXIV, 101-26, 1027-70.
