<h1>History of Dogmatic Theology</h1>  

<p>The imposing edifice of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> has been reared not by individual nations and men, but rather by the combined efforts of all nations and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of every century. Nothing could be more at variance with the essential character of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> than an endeavour to set upon it the stamp of nationalism: like the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> must ever be international. In the history of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>, three periods may be distinguished: <ul><li>the patristic <li>the medieval <li>the modern</ul>
<h2 id="section1">The patristic period (about A.D. 100-800)</h2>

<p>The Great <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers of the first 800 years rendered important services by their positive demonstration and their speculative treatment of dogmatic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is the Fathers who are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as her principal <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, excelling as they did in purity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life, and fulness of wisdom, virtues which are not always to be found in those who are known simply as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (b. about 160), who died a <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, (d. 254), who showed a marked leaning towards Hellenism, strayed far from the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But even some of the Fathers, e.g. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (d. 258) and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, went astray on individual points; the former in regard to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the latter in the matter of apocatastasis. It was not so much in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> as in the struggle with the great <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the age that patristic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> developed. This serves to explain the character of the patristic literature, which is apologetical and polemical, parenetical and ascetic, with a wealth of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> wisdom on every page; for the roots of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> are in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, especially in the Gospels and in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Although it was not the intention of the Fathers to give a methodical and systematic treatise of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, nevertheless, so thoroughly did they handle the great <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> from the positive, speculative, and apologetic standpoint that they laid the permanent foundations for the centuries to follow. Quite justly does M&ouml;hler call attention to the fact that all modes of treatment may be found in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>: the apologetic style is represented by the <a href="../cathen/05008b.htm">letter of Diognetus</a> and the letters of St. Ignatius; the dogmatic in pseudo-Barnabas; the moral, in the Pastor of Hermas; canon law, in the letter of St. Clement of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, in the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> and Ignatius. Owing to the unexpected recovery of lost <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> we may add: the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> style, in the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a>, in the "Proof of the Apostolic Preaching" by St. Iren&aelig;us.

<p>Although the different epochs of the patristic age overlap each other, it may be said in general that the apologetic style predominated in the first epoch up to <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, while in the second epoch, that is to say up to the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, dogmatic literature prevailed. We can here only trace in the most general outlines this <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> activity, leaving to patrology the discussion of the literary details.

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers entered the lists against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, a double task awaited them: they had to explain the principal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of natural religion, such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, creation, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and freedom of the will; at the same time they had to defend the chief mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, as the Trinity, <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, etc., and had to prove their sublimity, beauty, and conformity to reason. The band of loyal champions who fought against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is very large: <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a>, Hermias, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, <a href="../cathen/04165a.htm">Commodianus</a>, Arnobius, Lactantius, Prudentius, Firmicius Maternus, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, Nilus, Theodoret, Orosius, and Augustine. The most eminent writers in the struggle against <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> were: <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, Epiphanius, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>. The attacks of the Fathers were not, of course, aimed at the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitic</a> religion of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which was a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, but at the obstinacy of those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who, clinging to the dead letter of the Law, refused to recognize the prophetic spirit of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.



<p>But far greater profit resulted from conflict with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the first eight centuries. As the flint, when it is struck by the steel, gives off luminous sparks, so did <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, in its clash with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching, shed a new and wonderfully brilliant light. As the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were legion, it was natural that in the course of the centuries all the principal <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> were, one by one, treated in monographs which established their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and provided them with a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> basis. The struggle of the Fathers against <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, and Priscillianism served not only to bring into clearer light the essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, creation, the problem of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; it moreover secured the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> principles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> authority against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> aberrations. In the mighty struggle against <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> an opportunity was afforded to the Fathers and the ecumenical councils to establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Trinity, to secure it on all sides and to draw out, by speculation, its genuine import. When the contest with <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomianism</a> broke out, the fires of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> criticism purified the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, both earthly and heavenly. Of world-wide interest were the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> disputes, which, beginning with the rise of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a>, reached their climax in <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, and were revived once more in <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a>. In this long and bitter strife, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and Redemption, and in connection herewith Mariology also, was placed on a sure and permanent foundation, from which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never varied a hair's breadth in later ages. The following may be mentioned as the Eastern Champions in this scientific dispute on the Trinity and <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>: the great Alexandrines, Clement, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and Didymus the Blind; the heroic <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and the three Cappadocians (Basil, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>); <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a>; finally, Maximus the Confessor and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>. In the West the leaders were: <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary of Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Fulgentius of <a href="../cathen/13230c.htm">Ruspe</a>, and the two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>. As the contest with <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semi-pelagianism</a> purified the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of grace and liberty, providence and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and the condition of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a> in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, so in like manner the contests with the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> brought out more clearly and strongly the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>), the hierarchical constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> her <em>magisterium</em> or teaching authority, and her <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a>. In all these struggles it was Augustine who ever led with indomitable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and next to him came Optatus of Mileve and a long line of devoted disciples. The last contest was decided by the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (787); it was in this struggle that, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>, the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the veneration of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a> were placed on a scientific basis.

<p>It may be seen from this brief outline that the dogmatic teachings of the Fathers are a collection of monographs rather than a systematic exposition. But the Fathers broke the ground and furnished the material for erecting the system afterwards. In the case of some of them there are evident signs of an attempt to synthesize <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> into a complete and organic whole. Iren&aelig;us (<a href="../fathers/0103300.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III-V</a>) shows traces of this tendency; the well-known trilogy of <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (d. 217) marks an advance in the same direction; but the most successful effort in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity to systematize the principal <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in his work <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a>, which is unfortunately disfigured by serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. His work against Celsus, on the other hand, is a classic in <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> and of lasting value. <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (d. 394), skilled in matters <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and of much the same bent of mind as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, endeavoured in his "Large Catechetical Treatise" (<em>logos katechetikos ho megas</em>) to correlate in a broad synthetic view the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the Trinity, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and the Sacraments. In the same manner, though somewhat fragmentarily, Hilary (d. 366) developed in his valuable work "De Trinitate" the principal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The catechetical instructions of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (d. 386) especially his five mystagogical treatises, on the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> and the three Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, contain an almost complete dogmatic treatise, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (d. 496), in his two works "Ancoratus" and "Panarium", aimed at a complete dogmatic treatise, and St. Ambrose (d. 397) in his chief works: "De fide", "De Spiritu S.", "De incarnatione", "De mysteriis", <a href="../fathers/3406.htm">"De poenitentia"</a>, treated the main points of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> masterfully and in classic Latinity, though without any attempt at a unifying synthesis. In regard to the Trinity and <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (d. 444) is even today a model for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theologians</a>. Though all the writings of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (d. 430) are an inexhaustible mine, yet he has written one or two works, as the <a href="../fathers/1304.htm">"De fide et symbolo"</a> and the "Enchiridium", which may justly be called compendia of dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. Unsurpassed is his speculative work "De Trinitate" His disciple Fulgentius of <a href="../cathen/13230c.htm">Ruspe</a> (d. 533) wrote an extensive and thorough confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> under the title, "De fide ad Petrum, seu regula rect&aelig; fidei", a veritable treasure for the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his day.

<p>Towards the end of the Patristic Age <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a> (d. 636) in the West and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a> (b. ab. 700) in the East paved the way for a systematic treatment of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. Following closely the teachings of St. Augustine and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, St. Isidore proposed to collect all the writings of the earlier Fathers and to hand them down as a precious inheritance to posterity. The results of this undertaking were the "Libri III sententiarum seu de summo bono" Tajus of Saragossa (650) had the same end in view in his "Libri V sententiarum". The work of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (d. after 754) was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with still greater success; for not only did he gather the teachings and views of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, but by reducing them to a systematic whole he deserves to be called the first and the only scholastic among the Greeks. His main work, which is divided into three parts, is entitled: "Fons scienti&aelig;" (<em>pege gnoseos</em>), because it was intended to be the source, not merely of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a> as well. The third or <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> part, known as "Expositio fidei orthodox&aelig;" (<em>ekthesis tes orthodoxou pisteos</em>), is an excellent combination of positive and <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, and aims at thoroughness both in establishing and in elucidating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> has never gone beyond <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, a standstill caused principally by the Photian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (869). The only Greek prior to him who had produced a complete system of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, in the fifth century; but he was more popular in the West, at least from the eighth century on, than in the East. Although he openly wove into the genuine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> thoughts and phrases, nevertheless he enjoyed an unparalleled reputation among the greatest <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> because he was supposed to have been a disciple of the Apostles, For all that, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> did not take its guidance from <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> or <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, but from St. Augustine, the greatest of the Fathers. Augustinian thought runs like a golden thread through the whole progress of Western philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It was Augustine who led everywhere, who always pointed out the right path, and from whom all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> sought direction. Even the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> tried to bolster up their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> with the strength of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. Today his greatness is recognized and appreciated more and more, as specialized research goes more deeply into his works and brings to view his genius. As <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a> remarks, "It would be easy to compile from his writings a rich system of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>." We cannot help admiring the skill with which he ever kept <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the beginning and end of all things, in the central position, even where he was compelled to depart from earlier opinions which he had found to be untenable. The English-speaking world may well be proud of the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (d. 735), a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. Owing to his unusually solid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, his extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, he is the link which joins the patristic with the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The Middle Ages (800-1500)</h2>
<h3 id="B">The Middle Ages (800-1500)</h3>

<p>The beginnings of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> may be traced back to the days of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (d. 814). Thence it progressed in ever-guickening development to the time of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a>, and onward to its full growth in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (first epoch, 800-1200). The most brilliant period of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> embraces about 100 years (second epoch, 1200-1300), and with it are connected the names of <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, Bonaventure, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>. From the beginning of the fourteenth century, owing to the predominance of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> and to the sad condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> began to decline (third epoch, 1300-1500).
<h3 id="A">First epoch: beginning and progress of Scholasticism (800-1200)</h3>

<p>In the first half of this epoch, up to the time of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were more concerned with preserving than with developing the treasures stored up in the writings of the Fathers. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> was cultivated nowhere with greater industry than in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, founded and fostered by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The earliest signs of a new thought appeared in the ninth century during the discussions relative to the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> (Paschasius Radbertus, Ratramnus, <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>). These speculations were carried to a greater depth in the second Eucharistic controversy against <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a> (d. 1088), (<a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, Guitmund, <a href="../cathen/01310c.htm">Alger</a>, Hugh of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, etc.). Unfortunately, the only systematic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of this time, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Eriugena (d. after 870), was an avowed <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheist</a>, so that the name of "Father of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>" which some would give him, is wholly unmerited. But the one who fully deserves this title is <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a> (d. 1109). For he was the first to bring a sharp <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> to bear upon the principal <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the first to unfold and explain their meaning in every detail, and to draw up a scientific plan for the stately edifice of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. Taking the substance of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from Augustine, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, was not so much a disciple of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> as of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in whose masterly dialogues he had been thoroughly schooled. Another pillar of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> (d. 1153), the "Father of Mysticism". Though for the most part the author of ascetic works with a mystical tendency, he used the weapons of scientific <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> against <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> and the exaggerated Realism of Gilbert de La Porr&eacute;e. It is upon the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Anselm and Bernard that the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of succeeding generations took their stand, and it was their spirit which lived in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> efforts of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. Less prominent, yet noteworthy, are: Ruprecht of Deutz, William of Thierry, Gaufridus, and others.

<p>The first attempts at a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system may be seen in the so-called "Books of Sentences", collections and interpretations of quotations from the Fathers, more especially of St. Augustine. One of the earliest of these books is the "Summa sententiarum" of <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (1141). His works are characterized throughout by a close adherence to St. Augustine and, according to the verdict of <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>, may even yet serve as guides for beginners in the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of St. Augustine. Less praise is due to the similar work of Robert Pulleyn (d. 1146), who is careless in arranging the matter and confuses the various questions of which he treats. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a>, called the "Magister Sententiarum" (d. 1164), on the other hand, stands far above them all. What Gratian had done for canon law the Lombard did for dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. With untiring industry he sifted and explained and paraphrased the patristic lore in his "Libri IV sententiarum", and the arrangement which he adopted was, in spite of the lacun&aelig;, so excellent that up to the sixteenth century his work was the standard text-book of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The work of interpreting this masterpiece began as early as the thirteenth century, and there was no <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of note in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> who did not write a commentary on the Sentences of the Lombard. Hundreds of these commentaries are still resting, unprinted, beneath the dust of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. No other work exerted such a powerful influence on the development of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>. Neither the analogous work of his disciple, <a href="../cathen/11773b.htm">Peter of Poitiers</a> (d. 1205), nor the important "Summa aurea" of <a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a> (d. after 1230) superseded the Lombard's "Sentences" Along with Alain of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> (d, 1203), <a href="../cathen/15631c.htm">William of Auvergne</a> (d. 1248), who died as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, deserves special mention. Though preferring the free, unscholastic method of an earlier age, he yet shows himself at once an original <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and a profound <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. Inasmuch as in his numerous monographs on the Trinity, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, the Sacraments, etc., he took into account the anti-Christian attacks of the Arabian exponents of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>, he is, as it were, the connecting link between this age and the most brilliant epoch of the thirteenth century.
<h3 id="B">Second epoch: Scholasticism at its zenith (1200-1300)</h3>

<p>This period of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> was marked not only by the appearance of the "Theological Summ&aelig;", but also by the building of the great Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, which bear a sort of affinity to the lofty structures of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. (Cf. Emil Michael, S.J., "Geschichte des deutschen Volkes vom 13. Jahrh. bis zum Ausgang des Mittelalters", V, Freiburg, 1911, 15 sq.) Another characteristic feature was the fact that in the thirteenth century the champions of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> were to be found in the great <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, beside whom worked the Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>. This brilliant period is ushered in by two master-minds: the one a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (d. about 1245), the other a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> (d. 1280). The "Summa theologi&aelig;" of <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, the largest and most comprehensive work of its kind, is distinguished by its deep and mature speculation, though flavoured with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>. The arrangement of the subjects treated reminds one of the method in vogue today. An <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> giant not merely in matters <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> but in the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> as well, was <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>. It was he who made the first attempt to present the entire philosophy of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form and to place it at the service of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> &#151; an undertaking of far-reaching consequences. The <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> had indeed been rendered into Latin by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> and had been used in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> since the end of the sixth century; but the physics and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Stagirite</a> were made known to the Western world only through the Arabian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the thirteenth century, and then in such a way that <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> seemed to clash with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. This fact explains why his works were prohibited by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1210, and again by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1231. But after the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, led by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, had gone over the faulty Latin translation once more, had reconstructed the genuine <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and recognized the fundamental soundness of his principles, they no longer hesitated to take, with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> as their guide in the speculative study of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>.

<p>Two other representatives of the great orders are the gigantic figures of Bonaventure (d. 1274) and of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> (d. 1274), who mark the highest development of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, the "Seraphic Doctor", clearly follows in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, his fellow-religious and predecessor, but surpasses him in depth of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> and clearness of diction. Unlike the other <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of this period, he did not write a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "Summa", but amply made up for it by his "Commentary on the Sentences", as well as by his famous "Breviloquium", a "casket of pearls", which, brief as a compendium, is nothing less than a condensed Summa. <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> and Bonaventure are the real representatives of the old <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Schools, from which the later School of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> essentially differed. Yet it is not Bonaventure, but <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, who has ever been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the "Prince of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>". <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> holds the same rank among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as does <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>. Possessed of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">"Doctor angelicus"</a> is distinguished not only for the wealth, depth, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and for his systematic exposition of them, but also for the versatility of his genius, which embraced all branches of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> his most important work is the "Summa theologica". Experience has shown that, as faithful adherence to St. Thomas means progress, so a departure from his teachings invariably brings with it a decline of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. It seems providential, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "&AElig;terni Patris" (1879) restored the study of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, especially of St. Thomas, in all higher <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a measure which was again emphasized by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>. The fears prevalent in some circles that by the restoration of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> studies the results of modern thought would be forced back to the antiquated viewpoint of the thirteenth century are shown to be groundless by the fact that both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, while insisting on the acquisition of the "wisdom of St. Thomas", yet emphatically disclaim any intention to revive the unscientific notions of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. It would be folly to ignore the progress of seven centuries, and, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> since <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> have originated <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> problems which St. Thomas in his time could not foresee. Nevertheless, it is a convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> accuracy and comprehensiveness of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> system that it contains at least the principles <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the refutation of modern <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>.

<p>Before the brilliancy of the genius of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> even great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of this period wane into stars of the second and third magnitude. Still, <a href="../cathen/13045b.htm">Richard of Middleton</a> (d. 1300), whose clearness of thought and lucidity of exposition recall the master mind of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>, is a classical representative of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School. Among the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, <a href="../cathen/07235b.htm">Henry of Ghent</a> (d. 1293), a disciple of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, deserves mention; his style is original and rhetorical, his judgments are independent, his treatment of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> attests the profound thinker. In the footsteps of St. Thomas followed his pupil Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, who later became <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Pope Innocent V</a> (d. 1276), and Ulric of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (d. 1277), whose name is little known, though his unprinted "Summa" was held in high esteem in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The famous General of the Augustinians, &AElig;gidius of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (d. 1316), a scion of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Colonna, while differing in some details from the teaching of St. Thomas yet in the main adhered to his system. In his own order his writings were considered as classics. But the attempt of the Augustinian Gavardus in the seventeenth century to create a distinctly "&AElig;gidian School" <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a failure. On the other hand, adversaries of St. Thomas sprang up even in his lifetime. The first attack, came from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and was led by William de la Mare, of Oxford (d. 1285). Speaking broadly, English scholars, famous for their originality, played no mean part in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Being more of an empirical and practical than of an aprioristic and theoretical bent of mind, they enriched <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> with a new element. Their predilection for the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> is also the outcome of this practical sense. Like the links of an unbroken chain follow the names of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, Alfred (Anglicus), <a href="../cathen/10734a.htm">Alexander of Neckham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a>, Adam of Marsh, John Basingstoke, <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert Kilwardby</a>, <a href="../cathen/11599b.htm">John Pecham</a>, <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, Occam. Kuno Fischer is right when he says: "When travelling along the great highway of history, we may traverse the whole of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> down to <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon of Verulam</a> without leaving <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for a moment" ("Francis Bacon", Heidelberg, 1904, p. 4).

<p>This peculiar English spirit was embodied in the famous <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> (1266--1308). while in point of ability he belongs to the golden age of scholasticism, yet his bold and virulent criticism of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> system was to a great extent responsible for its decline. <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> cannot be linked with the old <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; he is rather the founder of the new <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a> School, which deviated from the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> and Bonaventure not so much in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> as in the speculative treatment of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Greater still is his opposition to the fundamental standpoint of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> likens the system of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and philosophy to the animal organism, in which the vivifying <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> permeates all the members, holds them together, and shapes them into perfect unity. In <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus's</a> own words, on the other hand, the order of things is rather symbolized by the plant, the root shooting forth branches and twigs which have an innate tendency to grow away from the stem. This fundamental difference also sheds light on the peculiarities of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus's</a> system as opposed to <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>: his formalism in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Trinity, his loose conception of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a>, his relaxation of the bonds uniting the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, his explanation of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> as an adductive substitution, his emphasis on the supremacy of the will, and so on. Though it cannot be denied that <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotism</a> preserved <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies from a one-sided development and even won a signal victory over <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> by its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the Immaculate Conception, it is nevertheless evident that the essential service it rendered to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the long run was to bring out, by the clash of arguments, the enduring solidity of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> structure. No one can fail to admire in St. Thomas the perspicuity of thought and the lucidity of diction, as contrasted with the abstruse and mystifying conceptions of his critic. In later centuries not a few <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of a calmer judgment, among them Constantine Sarnanus (1589) and John of Rada (1599), set about minimizing or even reconciling the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> differences of the two masters.
<h3 id="C">Third epoch: gradual decline of Scholasticism (1300-1500)</h3>

<p>The death of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> (d. 1308) marks the close of the golden era of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> system. What the following period accomplished in constructive work consisted chiefly in preserving, reproducing, and digesting the results of former ages. But simultaneously with this commendable labour we encounter elements of disintegration, due partly to the Fraticelli's wrong conception of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, partly to the aberrations and superficiality of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, partly to the distressing conflict between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> (Philip the Fair, Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the Exile at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>). Apart from the fanatical enthusiasts who were leaning towards <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the development and rapid spread of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> must be ascribed to two pupils of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> Peter Aureolus (d. 1321) and the Englishman William Occam (d. 1347), In union with <a href="../cathen/09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a> and John of Jandun, Occam used <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> for the avowed purpose of undermining the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. In this atmosphere flourished regalism and opposition to the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, until it reached its climax in the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> principle: "Concilium supra Papam", which was preached from the housetops up to the time of the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle. It is only fair to state that it was the pressing needs of the times more than anything else which led some great men, as Pierre d'Ailly (d. 1425) and <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> (d. 1429), to embrace a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which they abandoned as soon as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was healed. To understand the origin of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Huss</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, the history of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> must be studied. For what <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> was only the degenerated form which <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> presents. Even the more prominent <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> of the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as the general of the Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a> (d. 1359), and Gabriel Biel (d. 1495), who has been called the "last Scholastic", did not escape the misfortune of falling into grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Nominalistic subtleties, coupled with an austere pseudo-Augustinism of the ultra-rigoristic type, made <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a> the precursor of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. Gabriel Biel, though ranking among the better <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> and combining solidity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with a spirit of loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yet exerted a baneful influence on his contemporaries, both by his unduly enthusiastic praise of Occam and by the manner in which he commented on Occam's writings.

<p>The order which suffered least damage from <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> was <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">that of St. Dominic</a>. For, with the possible exception of Durand of St. Pou&ccedil;ain (d. 1332) and Holkot (d. 1349), its members were as a rule loyal to their great fellow-religious <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Most prominent among them during the first half of the fourteenth century were: Herv&aelig;us de Nedellec (d. 1323), a valiant opponent of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08475b.htm">John of Paris</a> (d. 1306); <a href="../cathen/11434c.htm">Peter of Palude</a> (d. 1342); and especially Raynerius of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (d. 1348), who wrote an alphabetical summary of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of St. Thomas which even today is useful. A prominent figure in the fifteenth century is St. Antonine of Florence (d. 1459), distinguished by his industry as a compiler and by his versatility as an author; by his "Summa Theologi&aelig;" he did excellent service for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a>. A powerful champion of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> was John Capreolus (d. 1444), the "Prince of Thomists" (<em>princeps Thomistarum</em>). Using the very words of St. Thomas, he refuted, in his adamantine "Clypeus Thomistarum", the adversaries of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> in a masterly and convincing manner. It was only in the early part of the sixteenth century that commentaries on the "Summa Theologica" of St. Thomas began to appear, among the first to undertake this work being <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a> of Vio (d. 1537) and Konrad K&ouml;llin (d. 1536). The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> "Summa contra Gentes" found a masterly commentator in Francis of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (d. 1528).

<p>Far less united than the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who partly favoured <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, partly adhered to pure <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotism</a>. Among the latter the following are worthy of note: <a href="../cathen/10091b.htm">Francis Mayronis</a> (d. 1327); John of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a>; <a href="../cathen/11772a.htm">Peter of Aquila</a> (d. about 1370), who as abbreviator of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> was called Scotellus (little <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>); Nicolaus de Orbellis (ca. 1460), and above all Lichetus (d. 1520), the famous commentator of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. William of Vorrilong (about 1400), Stephen Brulefer (d. 1485), and Nicholas of Niise (d. 1509) belong to a third class which is characterized by the tendency to closer contact with St. Bonaventure. A similar want of harmony and unity is discernible in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the other orders. While the Augustinians James of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> (d. 1308) and <a href="../cathen/14695c.htm">Thomas of Strasburg</a> (d. 1357) attached themselves to &AElig;gidius of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, thereby approaching closer to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a>, mentioned above, championed an undisguised <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>. Alphonsus Vargas of Toledo (d. 1366), on the other hand, was an advocate of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> in its strictest form. Among the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, also, divergencies of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> appeared. Gerard of Bologna (d. 1317) was a staunch <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a>, while his brother in religion <a href="../cathen/02191b.htm">John Baconthorp</a> (d. 1346) delighted in trifling controversies against the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a>. Drifting now with <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, now with <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotism</a>, this original genius endeavoured, though without success, to found a new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in his order. Generally speaking, however, the later <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> were enthusiastic followers of St. Thomas. The Order of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> produced in the fifteenth century a prominent and many-sided <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Dionysius Ryckel (d. 1471), surnamed "the Carthusian", a descendant of the Leevis <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who set up his chair in Roermond (Holland). From his pen we possess valuable commentaries on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a>, and St. Thomas. He was equally conversant with <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> and scholasticism. <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/07235b.htm">Henry of Ghent</a>, and Dionysius form a brilliant constellation which shed undying lustre on the German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>Leaving the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and turning our attention to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, we encounter men who, in spite of many defects, are not without merit in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. The first to deserve mention is the Englishman <a href="../cathen/14693b.htm">Thomas Bradwardine</a> (d. 1340), the foremost mathematician of his day and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. His work "De causa Dei contra Pelagianos" evinces a mathematical mind and an unwonted depth of thought. Unfortunately it is marred by an unbending, sombre rigorism, and this to such an extent that the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> of a later century published it in defence of their own teachings. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Bishop Richard Radulphus of Armagh (d. 1360), in his controversy with the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, also fell into dogmatic inaccuracies, which paved the way for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>. We may note in passing that the learned <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/10764a.htm">Thomas Netter</a> (d. 1430), surnamed Waldensis, must be regarded as the ablest controversialist against the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclifites</a> and <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> (d. 1404) stands out prominently as the inaugurator of a new speculative system in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>; but his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is in many respects open to criticism. A thorough treatise on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was written by John Torquemada (d. 1468), and a similar work by St. John Capistran (d. 1456). A marvel of learning, and already acknowledged as such by his contemporaries, was Alphonsus Tostatus (d. 1454), the equal of <a href="../cathen/11063a.htm">Nicholas of Lyra</a> (d. 1341) in Scriptural learning. He merits a place in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, inasmuch as he interspersed his excellent commentaries on the Scriptures with dogmatic treatises, and in his work "Quinque paradoxa" gave to the world a fine treatise on <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> and Mariology.

<p>As was to be expected, <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> went astray in this period and degenerated into sham pietism. A striking example of this is the anonymous "German Theology", edited by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>. This work must, however, not be confounded with the "German Theology" of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/02520a.htm">Berthold of Chiemsee</a> (d. 1543), which, directed against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, is imbued with the genuine spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Modern times (1500-1900)</h2>

<p>As during the Patristic period the rise of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> was the occasion of the development of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so the manifold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> brought about a more accurate definition of important <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. Along other lines also both these movements produced good effects. While in the period of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> the revival of classical studies gave new vigour to <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> and patrology, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> stimulated the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> which had remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Salamanca, Alcal&aacute;, Coimbra) and in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> (Louvain), to put forth an enthusiastic activity in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> research. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which had fallen behind during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, now came boldly to the front. The Sorbonne of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> regained its lost prestige only towards the end of the sixteenth century. Among the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> probably contributed most to the revival and growth of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a> distinguishes five epochs in this period.
<h3 id="A">First epoch: preparation (1500-1570)</h3>

<p>It was only by a slow process that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> rose from the depths into which it had fallen. The rise of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (1517) had inflicted serious wounds on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the defection of so many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> deprived her of the natural resources on which the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> necessarily depends. Nevertheless the list of the loyal contains many brilliant names, and the controversial works of those times include more than one valuable monograph. It was but natural that the whole literature of this period should bear an apologetical and controversial character and should deal with those subjects which had been attacked most bitterly: the rule and sources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, grace, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially the holy Eucharist. Numerous defenders of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> arose in the very country which had given birth to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>: <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">John Eck</a> (d. 1543), Cochl&aelig;us (d. 1552), Staphylus (d. 1564), James of Hoogstraet (d. 1527), <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">John Gropper</a> (d. 1559), <a href="../cathen/12082a.htm">Albert Pighius</a> (d. 1542), <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Cardinal Hosius</a> (d. 1579), Martin Cromer (d. 1589), and Peter Canisius (d. 1597). The last-named gave to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> not only his world-renowned <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, but also a most valuable Mariology. With <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and enthusiasm we look upon <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where the two noble <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">John Fisher</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester (d. 1535), and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Thomas More</a> (d. 1535) championed the cause of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with their pen, where <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> (d. 1568), Stephen Gardiner (d. 1555), and <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal William Allen</a> (d. 1594), men who combined refinement with a solid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, placed their learning at the service of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Church, while the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Nicholas Saunders wrote one of the best treatises on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the professors of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> opened new paths for the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, foremost among them were: Ruardus Tapper (d. 1559), John Driedo (d. 1535), <a href="../cathen/12667a.htm">Jodocus Ravesteyn</a> (d. 1570), <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">John Hessels</a> (d. 1566), John Molanus (d. 1585), and Garetius (d. 1571). To the last-named we owe an excellent treatise on the holy Eucharist. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> James Merlin, Christopher Chefontaines (d. 1595), and Gilbert G&eacute;nebrard (d. 1597) rendered great services to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. Sylvester Pierias (d. 1523), Ambrose Catharinus (d, 1553), and Cardinal Seripandus are the boast of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But, above all other countries, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> is distinguished by a veritable galaxy of brilliant names: Alphonsus of Castro (d. 1558), Michael de Medina (d. 1578), Peter de Soto (d. 1563). Some of their works have remained classics up to our own times, as "De natura et gratia" (Venice, 1547) of Dominic Soto; "De justificatione libri XV" (Venice, 1546) of Andrew Vega; "De locis theologicis" (Salamanca, 1563) of Melchior Cano.
<h3 id="B">Second epoch: late Scholasticism at its height (1570-1660)</h3>

<p>Even in the preceding epoch the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-1563) had exerted a beneficial influence on the character and extent of dogmatic literature. After the close of the council there sprang up everywhere a new life and a marvellous activity in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> which recalls the best days of the Patristic Era and of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> but surpasses both by the wealth and variety of its literary productions. We are not here concerned with the industry displayed in Biblical and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> research. But the achievements of controversial, positive, and <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> deserve a passing notice.

<p>(i) Controversial <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was carried to the highest perfection by Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (d. 1621). There is no other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> who has defended almost the whole of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> against the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> with such clearness and convincing force. Other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> remarkable for their masterly defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> were the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a> (d. 1603) and his pupils <a href="../cathen/14444a.htm">Adam Tanner</a> (d. 1632) and James Gretser (d. 1625), who taught in the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>. To the Englishman <a href="../cathen/14249b.htm">Thomas Stapleton</a> (d. 1508) we owe a work, unsurpassed even in our days, on the material and formal principle of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Cardinal du Perron (d. 1618) of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> successfully entered the arena against James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Philip Mornay, and wrote a splendid treatise on the holy Eucharist. The eloquent <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> (d. 1627) wielded his pen in refuting <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> from the standpoint of history. The "Pr&aelig;scriptiones Catholic&aelig;", a voluminous work of the Italian <a href="../cathen/06733a.htm">Gravina</a> (7 vols., Naples, 1619-39), possesses enduring value. Martin Becanus* (d. 1624), a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, published his handy and well-known "Manuale controversiarum". In <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> the defence of religion was carried on by the two learned brothers Adrian (d. 1669) and Peter de Walemburg (d. 1675), both <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> of Cologne and both controversialists, who easily ranked among the best. Even the distant East was represented in the two Greek converts, Peter Arcudius (d. 1640) and <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> (d. 1669).

<p>(ii) The development of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a> went hand in hand with the progress of research into the Patristic Era and into the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. These studies were especially cultivated in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. A number of scholars, thoroughly versed in history, published in excellent monographs the results of their investigations into the history of particular <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. Morinus (d. 1659) made the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> the subject of special study; Isaac Habert (d. 1668), the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> on grace; Hallier (d. 1659), the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Sacrament of Holy orders</a>, Garnier (d. 1681), <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>; De champs (d. 1701), <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>; <a href="../cathen/15040b.htm">Tricassinus</a> (d. 1681), St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace. Unfortunately, among the highly gifted representatives of this historico-dogmatical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were to be found men who deviated more or less seriously from the unchangeable teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius the Younger</a>, Launoy, de Marca, Dupin, and others. Though Nicole and Arnauld were <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, yet their monumental work on the Eucharist, "Perp&eacute;tuit&eacute; de la foi" (Paris, 1669-74), has not yet lost its value. But there are two men, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> (d. 1647) and the Oratorian <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Louis Thomassin</a> (d. 1695), who by their epoch-making works: "Dogmata theologica", placed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a> on a new basis without disregarding the speculative element.

<p>(iii) So great was the enthusiasm with which the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders fostered <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> and brought it to perfection that the golden era of the thirteenth century seemed to have once more returned. It was no mere chance that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and St. Bonaventure were just then proclaimed <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>, the first by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, the other by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. By these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> acts the two greatest luminaries of the past were proposed to the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as models to be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> imitated. <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>, guarded and cherished by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> anew its full vitality. At the head of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> movement was <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a> (d. 1604), the first and greatest opponent of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Molina (d. 1600). He wrote a valuable commentary on the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "Summa" of St. Thomas, which, combined with a similar work by <a href="../cathen/10143a.htm">Bartholomew Medina</a> (d. 1581), forms a harmonious whole. Under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a> a group of scholarly <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> took up the defence of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace: Alvarez (d. 1635), de Lemos (d. 1629), Ledesma (d. 1616), Massouli&eacute; (d. 1706), Reginaldus (d. 1676), Nazarius (d. 1646), John a St. Thoma (d. 1644), <a href="../cathen/09659a.htm">Kantes Mariales</a> (d. 1660), <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a> (d. 1681), Goudin (d. 1695), <a href="../cathen/04330a.htm">Contenson</a> (d. 1674), and others. However, the most scholarly, profound, and comprehensive work of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> did not come from the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of Salamanca; it is the invaluable "Cursus Salmanticensis" (Salamanca, 1631-1712) in 15 folios, a magnificent commentary on the "Summa" of St. Thomas. The names of the authors of this <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> work have unfortunately not been handed down to posterity. Outside the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, also, <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> had many <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and learned friends: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Alphonsus Curiel (d. 1609), Francis Zumel (d. 1607), John Puteanus (d. 1623), and the Irishman Augustine Gibbon (d. 1676), who laboured in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and at Erfurt in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were active in the interest of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>. At <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">William Estius</a> (d. 1613) wrote an excellent commentary on the "Liber Sententiarum" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a>, which was permeated with the spirit of St. Thomas, while his colleagues Wiggers and <a href="../cathen/14373a.htm">Francis Sylvius</a> (d. 1649) explained the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "Summa" of the master himself. In the Sorbonne <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> was worthily represented by men like Gammach&eacute; (d. 1625), Andrew Duval (d. 1637), and especially by the ingenious <a href="../cathen/15737a.htm">Nicholas Ysambert</a> (d. 1624). The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> also furnished an able work in the "Theologia scholastica" of <a href="../cathen/12687c.htm">Augustine Reding</a>, who held the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in that <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> from 1645 to 1658, and died as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> in 1692.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of this epoch in no way abandoned their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> opposition to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, but steadily continued publishing commentaries on <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a>, which throughout breathe the genuine spirit of <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotism</a>. It was especially <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who promoted the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> activity of their order, as Mauritius Hibernicus (d. 1603), Anthony Hickay (Hiqu&aelig;us, d. 1641), Hugh Cavellus, and <a href="../cathen/12227b.htm">John Ponce</a> (Pontius, d. 1660). The following <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a> also deserve to be mentioned: Francis de Herrera (about 1590), Angelus Vulpes (d. 1647), Philip Fabri (d. 1630), Bosco (d. 1684), and Cardinal Brancatus de Laurea (d. 1693). <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a> manuals for use in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were published about 1580 by Cardinal Sarnanus and by <a href="../cathen/07265a.htm">William Herincx</a>, this latter acting under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, on the other hand, adhered to St. Bonaventure, as, e.g., Peter Trigos (d. 1593), Joseph Zamora (d. 1649), <a href="../cathen/06394a.htm">Gaudentius of Brescia</a>, (d. 1672), Marcus a Baudunio (d. 1673), and others.

<p>But there can be no question that <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a> owes most of its classical works to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, which substantially adhered to the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, yet at the same time made use of a certain eclectic freedom which seemed to be warranted by the circumstances of the times. Molina (d. 1600) was the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> to write a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of St. Thomas. He was followed by Cardinal Toletus* (d. 1596) and by <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a> (d. 1603), mentioned above as a distinguished controversialist. A brilliant group in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> Francis Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Gabriel Vasquez, and Didacus Ruiz. Francisco Su&aacute;rez (d. 1617), the most prominent among them, is also the foremost <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> has produced. His renown is due not only to the fertility and the wealth of his literary productions, but also to his "clearness, moderation, depth, and circumspection" (<a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>). He truly deserves the title of "Doctor eximius" which <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> gave him. In his colleague Gabriel Vasquez (d. 1604) Francisco Su&aacute;rez; found a critic both subtle and severe, who combined positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with depth of speculation. Didacus Ruiz (d. 1632) wrote masterly works on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Trinity, subjects which were also thoroughly treated by Christopher Gilles (d. 1608). Harruabal (d. 1608), Ferdinand Bastida (d. about 1609), Valentine Herice, and others are names which will forever be linked with the history of <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinism</a>. During the succeeding period James Granado (d. 1632), John Pr&aelig;positus (d. 1634), <a href="../cathen/07583b.htm">Caspar Hurtado</a> (d. 1646), and Anthony Perez (d. 1694) won fame by their commentaries on St. Thomas. But, while devoting themselves to scientific research, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> never forgot the need of instruction. Excellent, often voluminous, manuals were written by <a href="../cathen/01753b.htm">Arriaga</a> (d. 1667), Martin Esparza (d. 1670), Francis Amicus (d. 1651), Martin Becanus* (d. 1625), <a href="../cathen/14444a.htm">Adam Tanner</a> (d. 1632), and finally by Sylvester Maurus (d. 1687), who is not only remarkable for clearness, but also distinguished as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. Hand in hand with this more general and comprehensive literature went important monographs, embodying special studies on certain dogmatic questions. Entering the lists against <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and his followers, Mart&iacute;nez de Ripalda (d. 1648) wrote the best work on the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. To <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Leonard Lessius</a> (d. 1623) we owe some beautiful treatises on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His attributes. <a href="../cathen/04253a.htm">&AElig;gidius Coninck</a> (d. 1633) made the Trinity, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the subject of special studies. Cardinal John de Lugo (d. 1660), noted for his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> acumen and highly esteemed as a moralist, wrote on the virtue of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist. Claude Tiphanus (d. 1641) is the author of a classical monograph on the notions of <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and hypostasis. Cardinal Pallavicini* (d. 1667), known as the historiographer of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, won repute as a <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theologian</a> by several of his writings.
<h3 id="C">Third epoch: further activity and gradual decline of Scholasticism (1660-1760)</h3>

<p>While the creative and constructive work of the previous epoch still continued, though with languishing vitality, and ushered in a second spring of dogmatic literature, other currents of thought set in which gradually prepared the way for the decline of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesianism</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Gallicanism, and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> were sapping the strength of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a>. There was scarcely a country or nation that was not infected with the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> spirit of the age. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> alone remained immune and preserved its ancient purity and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in matters <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>.

<p>One might have expected that, if anywhere at all, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> would be securely sheltered within the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Yet even some of these succumbed to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influences of the times, losing little by little their pristine firmness and vigour. Nevertheless, it is to them that almost all the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature of this period and the revival of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> are due, A product of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, widely used and well adapted to the needs of the time, was the standard work of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Billuart (d. 1757), which with exceptional skill and taste explains and defends the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> system in scholastic form. The <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> of Cardinal Gotti, however, rivals, if it does not surpass, Billuart's work, both as regards the substance and the soundness of its contents. Other <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> produced valuable monographs: Drouin* on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and Bernard de Rubeis (d. 1775) on <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. More eclectic in their adherence to <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a> were the Cardinals Celestine Sfondrato (d. 1696) and Aguirre (d. 1699); the latter's work "Theology of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>" in three volumes is replete with deep thought. Among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> <a href="../cathen/06244a.htm">Claudius Frassen</a> (d. 1680) issued his elegant "Scotus academicus", a counterpart to the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of Billuart. Of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a> School we also mention Gabriel Boyvin, Krisper (d. 1721), and Kick (d. 1769). <a href="../cathen/01434a.htm">Eusebius Amort</a> (d. 1775), the foremost <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, also represented a better type, combining sound conservatism with due regard for modern demands. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> still preserved something of its former vigour and activity. Simmonet, Ulloa (d. about 1723), and Marin were the authors of voluminous scholastic works. But now the didactical and pedagogical interests began to assert themselves, and called for numerous textbooks of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. We mention Platel (d. 1681), Antoine* (d. 1743), <a href="../cathen/12075a.htm">Pichler</a> (d. 1736), Sardagna (d. 1775), Erber, Monschein (d. 1769), and Gener. But both as regards <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form all these textbooks were surpassed by the "Theologia Wirceburgensis", which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> published in 1766-71. In addition to the old <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, we meet during this period the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Augustinians, who based their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> on the system of <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a> rather than on that of &AElig;gidius of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Because of the stress they laid on the rigoristic element in St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace, they were for a time suspected of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, but were cleared of this suspicion by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. To this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> belonged the scholarly <a href="../cathen/09436c.htm">Lupus</a> (d. 1681) at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Cardinal Noris</a> (d. 1704), distinguished for his subtle <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But its best work on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> came from the pen of Lawrence Berti (d. 1766). His fellow-workers in the same field were Bellelli (d. 1742) and Bertieri. The French Oratory, falling from its lofty eminence, was buried in <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, as the names of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, and Juenin sufficiently indicate.

<p>The Sorbonne of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, developing the germs of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and Gallicanism, ceased to keep abreast of the time. Abstracting, however, from this fact, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> owes works of great merit to men like Louis Habert (d. 1718), du Hamel (d. 1706), L'Herminier, Witasse (d. 1716). Creditable exceptions were <a href="../cathen/01039a.htm">Louis Abelly</a> (d. 1691) and Martin Grandin, who distinguished themselves by their loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The same encomium must be said of Honoratus Tourn&eacute;ly (d. 1729), whose "Pr&aelig;lectiones dogmatic&aelig;" are numbered among the best <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> text-books. A staunch opponent of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, he would certainly have challenged Gallicanism, had not the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the realm prevented him. For the rest, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> depended almost exclusively on <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in its scientific combat against the pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the time. There had gathered a chosen band of scholars who <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> fought for the purity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In the front rank against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> stood the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Dominic Viva (d. 1726), La Fontaine (d. 1728), Alticozzi (d. 1777), and Faure (d. 1779). Gallicanism and Josephinism were hard pressed by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, especially by Zaccaria (d. 1795), Muzzarelli (d. 1749), <a href="../cathen/02626b.htm">Bolgeni</a> (d. 1811), Roncaglia, and others. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were ably seconded by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Orsi</a> (d. 1761) and Mamachi (d. 1792). Another champion in this struggle was <a href="../cathen/06471b.htm">Cardinal Gerdil</a> (d. 1802). Partly to this epoch belongs the fruitful activity of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> (d. 1787), whose popular rather than scientific writings energetically opposed the baneful spirit of the time.
<h3 id="D">Fourth epoch: decay of Catholic theology (1760-1840)</h3>

<p>Many circumstances, both from within and from without, contributed towards the further decadence of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which had already begun in the preceding epoch. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it was the still powerful influence of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and Gallicanism, in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> the spread of Josephinism and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> that sapped the vitality of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> in 1773 deprived <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of its ablest representatives. To these factors must be added the paralyzing influence of the "Enlightenment" which, rising through <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, was swelled by French Encyclopedism and finally deluged all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the military expeditions of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> all through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were not without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences. The <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> philosophy of the time (<a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, Schelling, Fichte, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, Cousin, Comte, etc.), by which even many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were misled, engendered not only an undisguised contempt for <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> and even for <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, but also fostered a shallow conception of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of which was obscured by <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>. True, the spirit of former centuries was still alive in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but the unfavourable circumstances of the times impeded its growth and development. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and the continual campaigns paralyzed or stifled all productive activity. <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">De Lamennais</a> (d. 1854), the beginning of whose career had held out promises of the highest order, turned from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and led others astray. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> groaned under political oppression and religious intolerance. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had become barren. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> suffered from the mildew of "Enlightenment". No matter how mildly one may judge the aberrations of <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a> (1774-1860), <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, who had absorbed the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his age, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the movement begun by him marked a decadence in matters both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and scientific. But the poorer the productions of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> the greater their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. They despised the old <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, whom they could neither read nor understand. Among the few works of a better sort were the manuals of <a href="../cathen/15618d.htm">Wiest</a> (1791), Kl&uuml;pfel (1789), <a href="../cathen/05070a.htm">Dobmayer</a> (1807), and Brenner (1826). The ex-Jesuit Benedict Stattler (d. 1797) tried to apply to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> the philosophy of Christian Wolff, Zimmer (1802), even that of Schelling. The only work which, joining soundness with a loyal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit, marked a return to the old traditions of the School was the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> of Liebermann (d. 1844), who taught at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; it appeared in the years 1819-26 and went through many editions. But even Liebermann was not able to conceal his dislike for the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. The renewed attempt of <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a> (d. 1831) of Bonn to treat <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in a <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> spirit was no less fatal than that of G&uuml;nther (d. 1863) in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, who sought to unravel the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by means of a modern <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosis</a> and to resolve them into purely natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. If positive and speculative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> were ever to be regenerated, it was by a return to the source of its vitality, the glorious traditions of the past.
<h3 id="E">Fifth epoch: restoration of dogmatic theology (1840-1900)</h3>

<p>The reawakening of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in the forties naturally brought with it a revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> especially, where the decline had gone farthest, showed signs of a remarkable regeneration and vigorous health. The external impulse was given by Joseph G&ouml;rres (d. 1848), the "loud shouter in the fray". When the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Archbishop von Droste-Vischering</a> of Cologne on account of the stand he had taken in the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, the fiery appeals of G&ouml;rres began to fill the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, even outside of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, with unwonted <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. The German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> heard the call and once more applied themselves to the work which was theirs. <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> (d. 1890) developed <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a>, and M&ouml;hler advanced patrology and symbolism. Both positive and speculative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> received a new lease of life, the former through <a href="../cathen/08666a.htm">Klee</a> (d. 1840), the latter through <a href="../cathen/14282b.htm">Staudenmeier</a> (d. 1856). At the same time men like <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> (d. 1883), Werner (d. 1888), and St&ouml;ckl (d. 1895) earned for the despised <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> a new place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by their thorough historical and systematic writings. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/06684b.htm">Cardinal Gousset</a> (d. 1866) of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and the writings of Bishop Malou of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> (d. 1865) exerted great influence. In North America the works of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> (d. 1863) did untold good. Cardinal Camille Mazzella (d. 1900) is to be ranked among the North American <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as he wrote his dogmatic works while occupying the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Woodstock College, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the great Cardinals <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> (d. 1865), <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> (d. 1892), and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> (d. 1890) became by their works and deeds powerful agents in the revival of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life and in the advance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where the better traditions had never been forgotten, far-seeing men like <a href="../cathen/13453a.htm">Sanseverino</a> (d. 1865), <a href="../cathen/09215a.htm">Liberatore</a> (d. 1892), and <a href="../cathen/14776b.htm">Tongiorgi</a> (d. 1865) set to work to restore <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, because it was found to be the most effective weapon against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the time, i.e. traditionalism and ontologism, which had a numerous following among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The pioneer work in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a> fell to the lot of the famous <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> (d. 1876) in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His works on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, scattered throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world, freed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the miasmas which had infected it. Under his leadership a brilliant phalanx of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11518b.htm">Passaglia</a> (d. 1887), <a href="../cathen/13590a.htm">Schrader</a> (d. 1875), <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Cardinal Franzelin</a> (d. 1886), Palmieri (d. 1909), and others, continued the work so happily begun and reasserted the right of the speculative element in the domain of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Eminent among the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> was Cardinal Zigliara, an inspiring teacher and fertile author. Thus from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, where students from all countries foregathered, new life went forth and permeated all nations. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where Baader (d. 1841), G&uuml;nther, and Frohschammer (d. 1893) continued to spread their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, shared in the general uplift and produced a number of prominent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a> (d. 1887), <a href="../cathen/13415a.htm">Berlage</a> (d. 1881), <a href="../cathen/04786c.htm">Dieringer</a> (d. 1876), Oswald (d. 1903), <a href="../cathen/08672b.htm">Knoll</a> (d. 1863), <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a> (d. 1883), <a href="../cathen/13524a.htm">v. Sch&auml;zler</a> (d. 1880), <a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Bernard Jungmann</a> (d. 1895), Heinrich (d. 1891), and others. But <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany's</a> greatest <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> at this time was <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Joseph Scheeben</a> (d. 1888), a man of remarkable talent for speculation. In the midst of this universal reawakening the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> was held (1870), and the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> on the value of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a>, philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was issued (1879). Both these events became landmarks in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. An energetic activity was put forth in every branch of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> and is still maintained. Even though, consulting the needs of the time and the hostile situation, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> cultivate most assiduously historical studies, such as <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a>, <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a>, history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and history of religion, yet signs are not wanting that, side by side with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> also will enter upon a new era of progress. History shows that periods of progress in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> always follow in the wake of great ecumenical councils. After the first <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) came the great period of the Fathers; after the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) the wonderful age of mature <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>; and after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-63) the activity of later <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. It is not too much to hope that the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> which had to be adjourned indefinitely after a few general sessions, will be followed by a similar period of progress and splendour.
