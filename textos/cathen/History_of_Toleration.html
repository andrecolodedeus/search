<h1>History of Toleration</h1>  

<p>In any attempt to deal historically with the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards <a href="../cathen/14763a.htm">religious toleration</a> two considerations have throughout to be kept in mind. In the first place, nearly all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation in regard to the repression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> proceeds upon the assumption that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are in wilful revolt against lawful authority, that they are, in fact, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> who by their own culpable act have renounced the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> into which they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, breaking the engagements made by them, or by sponsors in their name, when they became members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It is easy to see that in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> this was not an unreasonable assumption. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> was then indeed as a city set upon a hill. No one could be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of her claims, and if certain people repudiated her authority it was by an act of rebellion inevitably carrying with it a menace to the sovereignty which the rest of the world accepted. This at least was the case with the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, and it was still the case with the immediate followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a>, and of the other early <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. Only by degrees and after a considerable lapse of time did generations come into being who could be regarded as inculpably <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, for the plea of invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> implies not only that their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> took place entirely under <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> influences, but also that they could attain adult life without being effectively confronted with the claims which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church makes upon the loyalty of reasonable men. It might plausibly be maintained, for example, that such conditions were at no time realized among the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, or in the more <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts of Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Hence we cannot be entirely surprised that there were those who excused such measures as the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, or who supported the repressive legislation which was inaugurated by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

<p>In the second place it is to be remembered that owing to the fact that the canon law deals very largely with the enunciation of principles of right and wrong which are of their own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> irreformable, the direct repeal of its provisions has never or very rarely been resorted to. This course undoubtedly has the great advantage of inspiring respect for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and stability of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but the consequence follows that there remain upon the statute-book a number of enactments which owing to changed conditions are to all practical intents and purposes obsolete. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, testamentary dispositions, matrimony, and especially <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, largely falls under this category, while the natural result of the retention of a considerable mass of obsolescent <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> must be the creation of an element of, at least temporary, uncertainty, under which some will favour and others resist the legislation that is passing away. For example there was bound to be a period during which rigourists would still appeal to the very uncompromising measures in dealing with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which were contemplated by many texts of the canon law, while on the other hand larger-minded contemporaries who were themselves perhaps living under political conditions which forced them to appreciate the advantages of toleration, tended to treat these same provisions as a dead letter and to deny them all validity in practical life. The effect of both these considerations has been to make it extremely difficult to draw a hard-and-fast line between the circumstances under which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> recognized the desirability of a large toleration of dissident opinions on the ground both of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and expediency, and those under which it seemed a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to stamp out by a policy of firm repression an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> germ which threatened indefinite mischief to the well-being of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Every lawfully-constituted <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> must put down on principle the propagation of such sedition as threatens its own existence, and this is not <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> so long as reason and humanity are respected in the means of suppression employed.

<p>Persecution begins when no reasonable proportion is observed between the force used in compulsion and the importance and power of the interests which it is sought to control. To determine the exact point at which legitimate repression passes into <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> is hence a matter of extreme difficulty. For this reason we should probably obtain a clearer view of the toleration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in past history by studying the relations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> with those bodies which like the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were recognized as lying outside her direct <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Regarded as a centre of spiritual authority the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not claim the unbaptized as subjects, but still the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as sovereigns of a temporal state had to adopt a definite attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who lived in their dominions. Tracing these relations as a whole and comparing them with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which prevailed among secular rulers of the time the principles formulated, and for the most part acted upon, by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, set an example of mildness to the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. As early as A.D. 598, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> clearly laid down that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, while they were to be restrained from presuming upon the toleration accorded to them by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, had a claim to be treated equitably and justly. They were to be allowed to keep their own festivals and religious practices, and their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, even in the case of their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, were to be respected (Greg. Mag. Regesta, M. G. H., II, 67 and 383). In the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there may be traced through a long series of pontificates the repeated confirmations of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, assignable probably in the first instance to <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Callixtus II</a> (c. 1120) and known as "Sicut Jud&aelig;is". It was a sort of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> charter of protection to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and in its first sentence are embodied certain words of one of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great's</a> letters just referred to. "As licence", says this document, "ought not to be allowed to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to presume in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> beyond what is permitted by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> so they ought not to be interfered with in such things as are allowed. We therefore, although they prefer to continue in their hardness of heart rather than be guided by the hidden meaning of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, do nevertheless, since they invoke our protection and aid, following in the footsteps of our predecessors and out of the mildness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, extend to them the shield of our protection." The document then lays down;

<ol><li>that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are not to be compelled by force to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but are only to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; <li>that apart from a judicial sentence in a court of law no one is to injure them in life or limb or to take away their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or to interfere with such customary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as they may have enjoyed in the places where they live; <li>that they are not to be attacked with sticks and stones on occasion of their festival celebrations, nor are they to be compelled to render any <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> services beyond such as are customary; <li>that their cemeteries in particular are not to violated. (See M. Stern, "Urkundliche Beitr&auml;ge", n. 171.) This charter reissued and confirmed as it was by some twenty or thirty pontiffs during a period of 400 years is certainly of much more weight as laying down the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> view of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of toleration, as an abstract principle, than any persecuting edicts evoked by special circumstances or coloured by the prepossessions of the individual legislator.</ol>



<p>Looking at the documents of unquestioned authenticity extracted by Stern from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Regesta it becomes clear that throughout the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in almost every emergency turned to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as to their natural protectors. Despite such legislation as that of the Fourth Council of Lateran (1215) imposing the wearing of a distinctive badge and excluding <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from public offices, still even such a summary as that in the Jewish Encyclopedia (s.v. "POPES") distinctly leaves the impression that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> exercised on the whole a markedly restraining influence on the persecuting spirit of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In particular, more than one of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, beginning with <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, issued <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> exonerating the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from that charge of ritual <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, which, as in the well-known story of little <a href="../cathen/07519c.htm">Hugh of Lincoln</a>, prejudiced public opinion so strongly against them (cf. Vacandard, "La Question du meurtre rituel chez les Juifs" in "Etudes de critique et d'histoire religieuse", 3d series, Paris, 1912). It was again the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (e.g., <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>) who at the time of the worst excesses of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Spanish Inquisition</a> exerted themselves to set some check upon the severities exercised against the Maranos in the Iberian Peninsula. The edicts issued at various times for the destruction of copies of the Talmud, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cum nimis absurdum" of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> constraining the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to live segregated in a Ghetto and subject to other harassing disabilities, represent rather the prejudices of individual pontiffs than any consistent principle of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Let it also be noted that the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has repeatedly been exerted for the protection of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> races against forcible conversion, and that it has freely tolerated such religious rites amongst savages as were not openly debasing and immoral. The history of the preaching of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> shows many examples in which the fanatical <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> lay with the profligate Spanish adventurers who conquered the country, while <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority advocated sympathy with the natives and indulgence for their religious observances. On the other hand this indulgence shown to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> customs, obviously enough, could not be extended without limit. Even British rule in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> ultimately considered it desirable to abolish the practice of suttee by which the wives of the upper classes were required to commit <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> upon the death of their husbands. This, however, was not effectively prohibited, even in the British provinces, until 1829.

<p>With regard to the toleration of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics the reader will do well to consult the article <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">INQUISITION</a>. No very systematic measures of repression seem to have come into practice before the twelfth century. The aggressive attitude adopted in the case of the Priscillianists (q.v.) and <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> was owing less to the action of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> than to that of the emperor. On the other hand, it cannot be disputed that after the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> was firmly established, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> campaigns were undertaken against the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> as well as later on against the followers of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wicklif</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>. Moreover isolated executions for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (burning at the stake being commonly employed for this purpose) were known before the twelfth century both in East and West; though at the same time the actual infliction of the punishment, then as after, must be regarded as an act of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> rather than that of any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal. But though an <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> practices may be regarded as having been first formally set up, at any rate in embryo, about the second half of the thirteenth century no measures of extreme severity were in the beginning prescribed or generally adopted. The Fourth Council of Lateran in 1215 imposed as a penalty the deprivation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and civil stakes. Convicted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> even though repentant, were excluded from public offices and were compelled to wear a badge. If their retractation was insincere they were liable to be confined in a public <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. At the same time it must not be forgotten that all these <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, as such an historian as Gairdner has noticed (Lollardy, I, 46), struck at the foundations of social order. M. Guiraud's account of the extravagant teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a> and <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> is conclusive upon the point. It cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that the severities which then began to be exercised in the name of religion were prompted by no <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for blood. It seemed rather to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was so menaced by these subversive doctrines that her very existence was at stake.

<p>Under these circumstances it was not wonderful that the ordinances of the canon law, for the most part formulated at a time when <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> teachings were a present danger, should have inclined to the side of severity and that to the lawmakers of that age toleration seemed only a weakness. "The proscription of the Albigenses", says M. Guiraud, "was not the effect of any ferocious <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of misbelievers too often attributed to the princes of that age. It was inspired by a consideration which has been happily defined by saying that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was at that time as much a crime against social order as against religion" (Guiraud, "Chartulaire de Prouille", I, lxxxiv). Even so anti-Roman an historian as Hase sums up the practical effects of the Lollard movement by saying "Wyclif produced no permanent religious impression upon the mass of the people. His teaching was misunderstood and caused a revolt of the peasants which resulted only in disaster" (Kirchengeschichte 1886, p. 353). Again it was not to be expected that the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> would be likely to mitigate the prevalent view of the mischievous nature of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The political and social evils to which the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> gave rise, as well as the fanatical <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by so many of their followers, are made clear beyond dispute in such a work as that of <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Janssen's</a> "History of the German People", to which the reader may be referred. It was only natural that the conception of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as an attack upon law and order as well as upon religion should be thereby deepened. Moreover in nearly every case where the reproach of intolerance has been cast against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as for example, the <a href="../cathen/13333b.htm">Massacre of Saint Bartholomew</a> or the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">HUGUENOTS</a>), the persecuting initiative has come far more from temporal rulers than from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or her representatives. On the other hand, the ferocity of the leading <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> more than equalled that of the most fiercely denounced inquisitors. Even the "gentle" <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> wrote to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> to congratulate him on the burning of Servetus. "The Church", he said, "both now and in all generations, owes and will owe you a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of gratitude." "Let there be no pity", <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> exhorted his followers, "it is a time of wrath not of mercy. . . . Therefore, dear Lords, let him who can slay, smite, destroy" (see Beard, "The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and Modern Thought"). "John Knox", said Acton (History of Freedom, p. 44), "thought that every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>." Moreover in any case there is more to be urged than a mere "tu quoque" argument. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has often given <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her moderation when brought into relation with those whom she was not <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> compelled to treat as rebels. No better examples can perhaps be afforded than the history of the foundation of some of the colonies in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, and notably that of the Province of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>.
