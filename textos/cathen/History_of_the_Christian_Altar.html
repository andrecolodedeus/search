<h1>History of the Christian Altar</h1>  

<p><a href="../images/01346aax.gif"><img alt="Image" align=left src="../images/01346aat.gif"></a> The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> altar consists of an elevated surface, tabular in form, on which the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> is offered. The earliest Scripture reference to the altar is in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs21">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>); the Apostle contrasts the "table of the Lord" (<em>trapeza Kyriou</em>) on which the Eucharist is offered, with the "table of devils", or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> altars. <em>Trapeza</em> continued to be the favourite term for altar among the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and in Greek <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, either used alone or with the addition of such reverential qualifying terms as <em>iera, mystike</em>, The <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#vrs10">Epistle to the Hebrews (13:10)</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> altar as <em>thysiasterion</em>, the word by which the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> alludes to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> altar. This term occurs in several of the Epistles of St. Ignatius (Ad Eph. v; Magnes. iv, 7; Philad. 4), as well as in the writings of a number of fourth and fifth century Fathers and historians; <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> employs it to describe the altar of the great church at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (<a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.4.44</a>). <em>Trapeza</em>, however, was the term most frequently in use. The word <em>bomos</em> to designate an altar. was carefully avoided by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the first age, because of its <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> associations; it is first used by Synesius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, a writer of the early fifth century. The terms <em>altare, mensa, ara, altarium,</em> with or without a genitive addition (as <em>mensa Domini</em>), are employed by the Latin fathers to designate an altar. <em>Ara</em>, however, is more commonly applied to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> altars, though <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> altar as <em>ara Dei</em>. But <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> makes a sharp distinction between <em>ara</em> and <em>altare</em>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> altars being <em>aras diaboli</em>, while the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> altar is <em>altare Dei</em> [<em>quasi post aras diaboli accedere ad altare Dei fas sit</em> (Ep. lxv, ed. Hartel, II, 722; P.L., Ep. lxiv, IV, 389)]. <em>Altare</em> was the word most commonly used for altar, and was equivalent to the Greek <em>trapeza</em>.
<h2 id="section1">Material and form</h2>

<p><a href="../images/01346adx.gif"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01346adt.gif"></a> The earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> altars were of wood, and identical in form with the ordinary house tables. The tables represented in the Eucharistic frescoes of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> enable us to obtain an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their appearance. The most ancient, as well as the most remarkable, of these frescoes, that of the <em><a href="../cathen/06165a.htm">Fractio Panis</a></em> found in the <em>Capella Greca</em>, which dates from the first decades of the second century, shows seven <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> seated on a semi-circular divan before a table of the same form. Tabular-shaped altars of wood continued in use till well on in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> speaks of a wooden altar which was burned by the Count Heraclius (Athan. ad Mon., lvi), and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> relates that the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> tore apart a wooden altar under which the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Bishop Maximianus had taken refuge (Ep. clxxxv, ch. vii, P.L., XXXIII, 805). The first legislation against such altars dates from the year 517, when the Council of Epaon, in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, forbade the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of any but stone Altars (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., VIII, 562). But this prohibition concerned only a small part of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, and for several centuries afterwards altars of wood were used, until the growing preference for altars of more durable material finally supplanted them. The two table altars preserved in the churches of St. John Lateran and St. Pudentiana are the only ancient altars of wood that have been preserved. According to a local tradition, St. Peter offered the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> on each, but the evidence for this is not convincing. The earliest stone altars were the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman Catacombs</a>. The practice of celebrating Mass on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> can be traced with a large degree of probability to the first quarter of the second century. The <em><a href="../cathen/06165a.htm">Fractio Panis</a></em> fresco of the <em>Capella Greca</em>, which belongs to this period is located in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> directly above a small cavity which Wilpert supposes (Fractio Panis, 18) to have contained the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and it is highly probable that the stone covering this <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> served as an altar. But the celebration of the Eucharist on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> was, even in the first age, the exception rather than the rule. (See <a href="../cathen/01699a.htm">ARCOSOLIUM</a>) The regular Sunday services were held in the private houses which were the churches of the period. Nevertheless. the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the stone altar, the use of which afterwards became universal in the West, is evidently derived from the custom of celebrating the anniversaries and other feasts in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of those who died for the Faith. Probably, the custom itself was suggested by the message in the Apocalypse (vi, 9) "I saw under the altar the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that were slain for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." With the age of peace, and especially under the pontificate of Pope Damasus (366-384), <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were erected in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the most famous <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and the altars, when at all possible, were located directly above their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> attributes to <a href="../cathen/06029b.htm">Pope Felix I</a> (269-274) a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the effect that Mass should be celebrated on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<em>constituit supra memorias martyrum missas celebrare,</em> "Lib. Pont.", ed. Duchesne, I, 158). However this may be, it is clear from the testimony of this authority that the custom alluded to was regarded at the beginning of the sixth century as very ancient (op. cit., loc. cit., note 2). For the fourth century we have abundant testimony, literary and monumental. The altars of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a>, erected by Constantine, were directly above the Apostles' <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. Speaking of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>, the poet Prudentius refers to the altar above his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> as follows: <blockquote> Talibus Hippolyei corpus mandatur opertis <br>Propter ubi apposita est ara dicata Deo. </blockquote>



<p>Finally, the translation of the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/06537a.htm">Sts. Gervasius and Protasius</a> by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> to the Ambrosian basilica in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> is an evidence that the practice of offering the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was long established. The great veneration in which the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were held from the fourth century had considerable influence in effecting two changes of importance with regard to altars. The stone slab enclosing the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> grave suggested the stone altar, and the presence of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> beneath the altar was responsible for the tomblike under-structure known as the <em>confessio</em>. The use of stone altars in the East in the fourth century is attested by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (P.G., XLVI, 581) and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (Hom. in I Cor., xx); and in the West, from the sixth century, the sentiment in favour of their exclusive use is indicated by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Council of Epaon alluded to above. Yet even in the West wooden altars existed as late as the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, as we infer from a capitulary of this emperor forbidding the celebration of Mass except on stone tables <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> [<em>in mensis lapideis ab episcopis consecratis</em> (P.L., XCVII, 124)]. From the ninth century, however, few traces of the use of wooden altars are found in the domain of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christianity</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, up to the present time, permits the employment of wood, stone, or metal.
<h2 id="section2">The <em>confessio</em></h2>

<p><a href="../images/01346aex.gif"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01346aet.gif"></a> Martyrs were Confessors of the Faith &#151; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who "confessed" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> before men at the cost of their lives &#151; hence the name <em>confessio</em> was applied to their last resting-place, when, as happened frequently from the fourth century, an altar was erected over it. Up to the seventh century in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as we learn from a letter of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> to the Empress Constantia, a strong sentiment against disturbing the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> prevailed. This fact accounts for the erection of the early Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, no matter what the obstacles encountered, over the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; the church was brought to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, not the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the church. The altar in such cases was placed above the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> with which it was brought into the closest relation possible. In St. Peter's, for instance, where the body of the Apostle was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at a considerable depth below the level of the floor of the basilica, a vertical shaft, similar to the <em>luminaria</em> in some of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, was constructed between the Altar and the sepulchre. Across this shaft, at some distance from each other, were two perforated plates, called <em>cataractae</em>, on which cloths (<em>brandea</em>) were placed for a time, and afterwards highly treasured as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. But the remains of St. Peter, and those of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, were never disturbed. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of both Apostles were enclosed by Constantine in cubical cases, each adorned with a gold cross (Lib. Pont., ed. Duchesne, I, 176). From that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to the present time, except in 1594, when <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> with <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and some other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> saw the cross of Constantine on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Peter, the interior of their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> has been hidden from view. Another form of <em>confessio</em> was that in which the slab enclosing the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was on a level with the floor of the sanctuary (<em>presbyterium</em>). As the sanctuary was elevated above the floor of the basilica the altar could thus be placed immediately above the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, while the people in the body of the church could approach the <em>confessio</em> and through a grating (<em>fenestella confessionis</em>) obtain a view of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. One of the best examples of this form of <em>confessio</em> is seen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Giorgio in Velabro, where the ancient model is followed closely A modified form of the latter (fifth-century) state of <em>confessio</em> is <a href="../images/01346aex.gif">that in the basilica of San Alessandro</a> on the Via Nomentana, about seven miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In this case the sanctuary floor was not elevated above the floor of the Basilica, and therefore the <em>fenestella</em> occupied the space between the floor and the table of the altar, thus forming a combination <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and table altar. In the <em>fenestella</em> of this altar there is a square opening through which <em>brandea</em> could be placed on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>.
<h2 id="section3">The ciborium</h2>

<p><a href="../images/01346afx.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01346aft.jpg"></a> From the fourth century altars were, in many instances, covered by a canopy supported on four columns, which not only formed a protection against possible accidents, but in a greater degree served as an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> feature of importance. This canopy was known as the <em><a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a></em> or <em>tegurium</em>. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of it may have been suggested by <em>memoriae</em> such as those which from the earliest times protected the graves of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; when the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of these Apostles were erected, and their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> became altars, the appropriateness of protecting-structures over the tomb-altars, bearing a certain resemblance to those which already existed, would naturally suggest itself. However this may be, the dignified and beautifully ornamented <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> as the central point of the basilica, where all religious functions were performed, was an artistic necessity. The altar of the basilica was simple in the extreme, and, consequently, in itself too small and insignificant to form a centre which would be in keeping with the remainder of the sacred edifice. The <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> admirably met this requirement. The altars of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> erected by Constantine at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were surmounted by ciboria, one of which, in the Lateran, was known as a <em>fastigium</em> and is described with some detail in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>. The roof was of silver and weighed 2,025 pounds; the columns were probably of marble or of porphyry, like those of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. On the front of the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> was a scene which about this time became a favourite subject with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> artists: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. All the figures were five feet in height; the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> weighed 120 pounds, and those of the Apostles ninety pounds each. On the opposite side, facing the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was again represented <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, but surrounded by four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> with spears; a good <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> may be had from a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of the same subject in the church of Sant' Apollinare Nuovo, at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The interior of the Lateran Ciborium was covered with gold, and from the centre hung a chandelier (<em>farus</em>) "of purest gold, with fifty dolphins of purest gold weighing fifty pounds, with chains weighing twenty-five pounds". Suspended from the arches of the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, or in close proximity to the altar, were "four crowns of purest gold, with twenty dolphins, each fifteen pounds, and before the altar was a chandelier of gold, with eighty dolphins, in which pure nard was burned". Seven other altars were erected in the basilica, probably to receive the oblations; Duchesne notes the coincidence of the number of subsidiary altars with the number of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (Liber Pont., I, 172, and note 33, 191). This splendid canopy was carried away by Alaric in 410, but a new <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> was erected by the <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Emperor Valentinian III</a> at the request of <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Pope Sixtus III</a> (432-440). Only fragments of a few of the more ancient ciboria have been preserved to our time, but the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> of Sant' Apollinare in Classe, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (ninth century), reproduces their principal features.
<h2 id="section4">Chancel</h2>

<p>In his description of the Basilica of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> the historian <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says (<a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.4</a>) that the altar was enclosed "with wooden lattice-work, accurately wrought with artistic carving", so that it might be rendered "inaccessible to the multitude". The partition thus described, which separated the <em>prebyterium</em> and choir from the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, was the <em>cancellus</em> or <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>. In a later age the name "chancel" came to be applied to the <em>presbyterium</em> itself. Portions of a number of ancient <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancels</a> have been found in Roman churches, and from reconstructions made with their help by archaeologists a good <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> may be obtained. Two of these restored <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancels</a>, made from fragments found in the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> of Equizio and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Lorenzo, show the style of workmanship, which consisted of geometrical designs. <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">Chancels</a> were made of wood, stone, or metal.

<p><a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, erected in St Peter's, in front of the <em>presbyterium</em>, six marble columns adorned with vine-traceries. Whether these columns were originally connected by an architrave is uncertain, but in the time of <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Pope Sergius III</a> (687-701) this feature existed. They seem to have served for no special object, and therefore were probably intended to add dignity to the <em>presbyterium</em>. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Resurrection at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, also erected by Constantine, there were twelve similar columns, corresponding with the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The <em>iconostasis</em> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> and the rood-screen of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> are evidently traceable to this ornamental feature of the two fourth-century <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>. The <em>iconostasis</em>, like the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, separated the presbyterium from the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. Its original form was that of an open screen, but from the eighth century, owing to the reaction against iconoclasm, it began to assume its present form of a closed screen decorated with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a> of six columns (seventh century) in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Torcello gives an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a> in the Constantinian <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> referred to.
<h2 id="section6">The dove and tabernacle</h2>

<p>During the first age of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were allowed, when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was imminent, to reserve the Eucharist in their homes. (See <a href="../cathen/01686d.htm">ARCA</a>.) This custom gradually disappeared in the West about the fourth century. The Sacred Hosts for the sick were then kept in churches where special receptacles were prepared for them. These receptacles mere either in the form of a dove which hung from the roof of the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, or, where a <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> did not exist, of a tower (the <em>turris Eucharistica</em>) which was placed in an <em>armarium</em>. In a drawing of the thirteenth-century altar of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> an arrangement is seen which is evidently a reminiscence of the suspended dove in those countries where the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> had disappeared: the Eucharistic tower is suspended above the altar from a staff in the form of a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>. The more ordinary receptacle for this purpose, up to the seventeenth century, was the <em>armarium</em> near, or an octagon-shaped tower placed on the Gospel side of, the altar. Tabernacles of the latter kind were generally of stone or wood; those of the dove class of some precious metal. Our present form of tabernacle dates from the end of the sixteenth century.
<h2 id="section7">Consecration</h2>

<p>No special formula for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of altars was in use in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> before the eighth century. In substance, however, what we understand by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was practiced in the fourth century. This original form of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> consisted in the solemn transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the altar of a newly erected church The translation of the bodies of <a href="../cathen/06537a.htm">Sts. Gervasius and Protasius</a>, made by St. Ambrose, is the first recorded example of the kind. (See <a href="../cathen/01388c.htm">AMBROSIAN BASILICA</a>.) But such translations of the mortal remains of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were at this time, and long afterwards, of rare occurrence. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a>, however, by which we must understand objects from a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> (the <em>brandea</em> mentioned above), were regarded with only a less degree of respect than the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> themselves, and served as it were to multiply the body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. This reverence for objects associated with a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> gave rise to the custom of entombing such <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> beneath the altars of newly erected churches, until it ultimately became the rule not to dedicate a church without them. An early example of this practice was the dedication of the <em>basilica Romana</em> by St. Ambrose with <em>pignora</em> of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Vita Ambros., by Paulinus, c. xxxiii). <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> (Lib. II, de Mirac., I, P.L., LXXI, 828) mentions the dedication of the Church of St. Julian in his episcopal city with <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of that saint and of another. When <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> could not be procured, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Hosts and fragments of the Gospels were sometimes used; concerning the use of the former for this purpose the English Synod of Calchut (Celicyth, Chelsea, 816) made a regulation (can. 22). Up to the middle of the sixth century in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> the solemn celebration of Mass was the only form of dedication. If, however, it had been decided to place in the altar the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> preceded the first solemn function in the new edifice. Duchesne points out (op. cit., 406) that the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Gelasian Sacramentary recited for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of altars bear the unmistakable stamp of the funeral liturgy, this fact is evidently attributable to the Custom of entombing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, regarded as representing the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, at the time of dedication. The translation of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> was a second solemn interment of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> body, and hence the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> composed for such occasions appropriately bore the characteristics of the burial service. The principal features of the earliest form of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, as given in the Gelasian Sacramentary, are as follows: The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, chanting the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, first proceeded in solemn procession to the place where the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were kept. A <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was then chanted and the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were borne by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the door of the church and there placed in the custody of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then entered the church, accompanied by his immediate attendants, and after <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcising</a> the water and mixing with it a few drops of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, he prepared the mortar for enclosing the sepulchre. With a sponge he then washed the table of the altar, and returning to the door he sprinkled the people with what remained of the <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>. After this he took the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and re-entered the church, followed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people chanting another <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>. The sepulchre was then anointed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed therein, and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> sealed. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> concluded with the solemn celebration of Mass. The Gallican liturgy of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, unlike that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, partook of the character of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> for the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation rather than that of the funeral liturgy. "Just as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is dedicated by water and oil, by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation, so the altar first, then the church, is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by ablution and unction" (Duchesne, op. cit., 407-409). In the eighth and ninth centuries attempts were made by <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> to combine the two <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Gaul, from the result then achieved has developed the actual <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> ritual of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> the dedication of the altar was a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> distinct from that of the deposition of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, the two functions were ordinarily performed on different days. On the first day the table of the altar was placed on its support of columns by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in person. After this he proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> which consisted of washing the table, first with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water, then with wine. The altar was next anointed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>. The following day the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed in the sepulchre with the greatest solemnity. Duchesne calls attention to the close resemblance between the Gallican and the Byzantine liturgy for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of altars (op. cit., 416).
<h2 id="section8">Orientation</h2>

<p>The custom of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with faces turned towards the East is probably as old as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The earliest allusion to it in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature is in the second book of the Apostolic Constitutions (200-250, probably) which prescribes that a church should be oblong "with its head to the East". <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> also speaks of churches as erected in "high and open places, and facing the light (Adv. Valent., iii). The reason for this practice, which did not originate with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, was given by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (De Orat. Dominic., P.G., XLIV, 1183), is that the Orient is the first home of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, the seat of the earthly <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> additional reasons for orientation were given, namely, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> from the Cross looked towards the West, and from the East He shall come for the Last Judgment (Durand, Rationale, V, 2; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/3084.htm#article3">Summa Theologica II-II:84:3).</a> The existence of the custom among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> is referred to by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, who states that their "most ancient <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> looked towards the West, that people might be taught to turn to the East when facing the images" (Stromata, vii. 17, 43). The form of orientation which in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was generally adopted consisted in placing the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and altar in the Eastern end of the basilica. A system of orientation exactly the opposite of this was adopted in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of the age of Constantine. The Lateran, St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's</a>, and San Lorenzo in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as well as the Basilicas of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Antioch and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Resurrection at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, had their <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apses</a> facing the West. Thus, in these cases the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from his throne in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> looked towards the East. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the second <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">Basilica of St. Paul</a>, erected in 389, and the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli, erected probably in the latter half of the fourth century reversed this order and complied with the rule. The Eastern <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> is the rule also in the churches of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and generally throughout the East. Whether this form of orientation exercised any influence on the change of the celebrant from the back to the front of the altar cannot well be determined but at all events this custom gradually supplanted the older one, and it became the rule for both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people to look in the same direction, namely, towards the East (Mabillon, Museum Italicum, ii, 9). Strict adherence to either form of orientation was, necessarily, in many instances impossible, the direction of streets in cities naturally governed the position of churches. Some of the most ancient churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were directed towards various points of the compass.
<h2 id="section9">Ancient and medieval altars</h2>

<p><a href="../images/01346abx.gif"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01346abt.gif"></a> Few ancient altars have survived the ravages of time. Probably the oldest of these is the fifth-century altar discovered at Auriol, near <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. The stone table, on the front of which the monogram of Christ, with twelve doves, is engraved, rests on a single column. Similar in construction to this are three altars in the <em>confessio</em> of the Church of St. Caecilia in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which are attributed to the ninth century. In two sixth-century <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of San Vitale and Sant' Apollinare in Classe, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, two table altars of wood, resting on four feet, are represented. They are covered by a long cloth which completely hides the tables. Enlart regards it as probable that the tables enclosed in the altars of the Lateran and Santa Pudenziana are similar in appearance (Manuel d'arch&eacute;ol. Fran&ccedil;aise, I, Archit. Relig., note 1). Altars of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> type, like the sarcophagi of the Constantinian epoch, offered a surface the front of which was well adapted to sculptured decoration. The earliest existing example of an altar with a carved <a href="../images/01346agx.jpg">antependium</a>, however, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Cividale, dates from the beginning of the eighth century. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is here represented in the centre of the antependium, accompanied by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, while the hand of the Father appears above His head. Of greater interest is the antependium, as well as the side panels, of the altar of the Ambrosian basilica in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The front, over seven feet in length, is of gold, the back and sides of silver. Both front and back are paneled into three compartments, in which reliefs from the life of Christ and St. Ambrose are represented. The subjects of the central panel of the front are a Greek cross, in the centre of which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> is represented; in the arms of the cross are the symbols of the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, while the remaining spaces contain representations of the Apostles; Crosses are represented on the ends also, with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in various attitudes. The famous reredos of St. Mark's, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, known as the <em>Pala d'oro</em>, which dates from the tenth century, was originally an antependium. To the following (eleventh) century belongs the splendid golden antependium presented to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Basle by the Emperor Henry II now in the Mus&eacute;e de Cluny at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In five column arcades the figures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, the Archangels Gabriel, <a href="../cathen/12640b.htm">Raphael</a>, and Michael, and St. Benedict are represented. Such costly antependia as these were of course rare; the material more commonly used was wood, with representations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. A <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> wooden panel, arcaded in a manner very similar to the antependium of Basle, is preserved in the episcopal museum of M&uuml;nster in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. It dates from the twelfth century. Down to the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> was in general use as a protection and ornamental feature of altars. The <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> of Sant' Apollinare in Classe, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, which belongs to the early ninth century, is, as noted above, essentially the same as those of the earlier period. After the tenth century, however, except in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the Orient, where ciboria were always in favour, they were rarely employed. The best example of a <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> of the early Gothic period is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady of Halberstadt, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; two other Gothic ciboria are in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> numerous <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> ciboria still exist. The early types of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> altar, unlike those most in vogue during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, had no superstructure. So long, indeed, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> throne occupied the centre of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, a reredos (<em>retabulum</em>), which would conceal the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from the congregation, would have been impracticable. By degrees, as we have seen, the custom was introduced, with the general adoption of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the celebrant facing in the same direction as the congregation, and it became possible to introduce an ornamental panel at the back of the altar similar to the antependium. Probably the custom of exposing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> on the altar, approved by <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Pope Leo IV</a> (P.L., CXV, 677), exercised some influence on the development of the reredos, and the antependium naturally suggested its form. The reredos was introduced about the beginning of the twelfth century. The oldest existing example of it is the <em>Pala d'oro</em> of St. Mark's, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which, after reconstruction, was detached from the front and placed at the back of the altar by the Doge Ordefalo Faliero, in 1105. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Kloster-Neuburg, near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, also contains a beautiful example of a twelfth-century reredos, with representations from the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The reredos of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was only moderately elevated when compared with the style which found favour in the late Gothic and <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> periods. The practice of exhibiting <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> was, as we have seen, authorized in the ninth century, but not before the thirteenth century were <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> permanently kept on, or more frequently behind, the altar. In the latter case a platform was specially constructed for the purpose In some instances the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> formed part of the reredos but the more common arrangement was to place them on a platform. This practice of permanently exposing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> behind the altar influenced certain other changes of importance with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> and the <em>confessio</em>. The latter feature now disappeared; there was no longer a reason for its existence, since the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were provided with a new location; and the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> was modified into a <em>baldacchino</em> elevated above the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> back of the altar. An example of this arrangement, of the thirteenth century, may be seen in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, in the

<p><a href="../images/01346abx.gif">church of St. Denis</a>, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. At first only the altar of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, usually placed at the end of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, was provided with a reredos, but in the course of the fourteenth century the main altar also was similarly provided. The comparative simplicity of the early reredos gradually yielded, in the course of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries, to the prevalent taste for richness of adornment, and <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> became of secondary consideration. The reredos now became a great structure, reaching in many instances to the vault of the church, containing life-sized <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, besides a number of representations in relief of sacred subjects. This structure was usually of wood, carved or <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>. It was connected with the altar by means of a predella, or altar-step, similar to the predella of modern altars, for candelabra, on which the Apostles or other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were depicted. Towards the end of the sixteenth century the influence of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> effected another change in the form of the altar. Porticoes, modelled after the triumphal arches of antiquity, with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in high and low relief, took the place of the reredos, and more costly materials, such as rare marbles. were employed in their construction. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries especially, altars of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style became surcharged with ornamentation, often in bad taste and of inferior materials.
