<h1>History of the Jesuits Before the 1773 Suppression</h1>  

<h3>Italy</h3>

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was generally very peaceful. The only serious disturbances were those arising from the occasional quarrels of the civil governments with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> powers. <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius'</a> first followers were immediately in great request to instruct the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and to reform the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. Though there was little organized or deep-seated mischief, the amount of lesser evils was immense; the possibility here and there of a catastrophe was evident. While the preachers and missionaries evangelized the country, colleges were established at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and other cities. On 20 April 1555, the University of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> addressed to the Sorbonne a most remarkable testimony in favor of the order. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> was, after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, perhaps the most generous of all the patrons, and they freely put their best talents at his disposal. (For the difficulties about his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and with Fr. Guillo Mazarino, see Sylbain, "Hist. de S. Charles", iii, 53.) Juan de Vega, ambassador of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had learnt to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and esteem Ignatius there, and when he was appointed Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> he brought <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> with him. A college was opened at <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>; success was marked, and its rules and methods were afterwards copied in other colleges. After fifty years the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> counted in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> 86 houses and 2550 members. The chief trouble in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> occurred in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> at 1606, when <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> laid the city under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> for serious breaches of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and some other religious retired from the city, and the Senate, inspired by <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Paolo Sarpi</a>, the disaffected friar, passed a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of perpetual banishment against them. In effect, though peace was made ere long with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, it was fifty years before the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> could return. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, during the first two centuries of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was still the most cultured country in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> enjoyed a high reputation for learning and letters. The elder Segneri is considered the first of Italian preachers, and there are a number of others of the first class. <a href="../cathen/09522a.htm">Maffei</a>, Torellino, Strada, Palavicino, and <a href="../cathen/02317b.htm">Bartoli</a> have left historical works which are still highly prized. Between <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (d. 1621) and Zaccharia (d. 1795) <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of note in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, controversy, and subsidiary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are reckoned by the score. They also claim a large proportion of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, generals, and missionaries. (See also BELECIUS; <a href="../cathen/02626b.htm">BOLGENI</a>; <a href="../cathen/02691a.htm">BOSCOVICH</a>; <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">POSSEVINUS</a>; SCARAMELLI; VIVA.) <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was divided into five provinces, with the following figures for the year 1749 (shortly before the beginning of the movement for the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>); <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 848; <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> 667; <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> 775; <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> 707; <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> 625; total 3622 members, about one-half of whom were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with 178 houses.
<h3>Spain</h3>

<p>Though the majority of Ignatius' companions were <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, he did not gather them together in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> paid only passing visits there. In 1544, however, Father Aroaz, cousin of St. Ignatius and a very eloquent preacher, came with six companions, and then their success was rapid. On 1 September, 1547, Ignatius established the province of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with seven houses and about forty religious; <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a> joined in 1548; in 1550, Lainez accompanied the Spanish troops in their African campaign. With rapid success came unexpected opposition. Melchior Cano, O.P., a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> reputation, attacked the young order, which could make no effective reply, nor could anyone get the professor to keep the peace. But, very unpleasant as the trial was, it eventually brought advantage to the order, as it advertised it well in <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> circles, and moreover drew out defenders of unexpected efficiency, as Juan de la Pe&ntilde;a of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and even their general, Fra Francisco Romero. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> continued to prosper, and Ignatius subdivided (29 September, 1554) the existing province into three, containing twelve houses and 139 religious. Yet there were internal troubles both here and in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> under Simon Rodriguez, which gave the founder anxieties. In both countries the first houses had been established before the Constitutions and rules were committed to writing. It was inevitable therefore that the discipline introduced by Aroaz and Rodriguez should have differed somewhat from that which was being introduced by Ignatius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the good offices of Borgia and the visits of Father Nadal did much to effect a gradual unification of the system, though not without difficulty. These troubles, however, affected the higher officials of the order rather than the rank and file, who were animated by the highest motives. The great preacher Ramirez is said to have attracted 500 vocations to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders at Salamanca in the year 1564, about 50 of them to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. There were 300 <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at the death of Ignatius in 1556; and 1200 at the close of Borgia's generalate in 1572. Under the non-Spanish generals who followed, there was an unpleasant recrudescence of the nationalistic spirit. Considering the quarrels which daily arose between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and other nations, there can be no wonder at such ebullitions. As has been explained under Acquaviva, Philip of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> lent his aid to the discontented parties, of whom the virtuous <a href="../cathen/01108b.htm">Jos&eacute; de Acosta</a> was the spokesman, Fathers Hern&eacute;ndez, Dionysius V&aacute;squez, Henr&iacute;quez, and Mariana the real leaders. Their ulterior object was to secure a separate comissary-general for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. This trouble was not quieted till the fifth congregation, 1593, after which ensued the great debates <em>de auxiliis</em> with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the protagonists on both sides being <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/04238a.htm">Congregatio de Auxiliis</a>; Grace, Controversies on.)


<p>Serious as these troubles were in their own sphere, they must not be allowed to obscure the fact that in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, as in all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organizations of that day, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> played the greatest roles. When we enumerate their great men and their great works, they defy all comparison. This comparisons gains further force when we remember that the success of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and in the parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> then united with the Spanish crown was largely due to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, which country with its far-stretching colonies was also under the Spanish crown from 1581 to 1640, though neither the organization of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> nor the civil government of the country itself was amalgamated with those of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But it was in the more abstract <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> that the Spanish genius shone with the greatest lustre; Toledo (d. 1596), Molina (1600), de Valentia (1603), V&aacute;squez* (1604), Francisco Su&aacute;rez (1617), <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a> (1648), de Lugo (1660) (qq.v.)--these form a group of unsurpassed brilliance, and there are quite a number of others almost equally remarkable. In <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, S&aacute;nchez* (1610), Azor (1603), Salas (1612), <a href="../cathen/03415b.htm">Castro Palao</a> (1633), Torres (Turrianus, 1635), <a href="../cathen/05534b.htm">Escobar y Mendoza</a> (1669). In Scripture, Maldonado (1583), Salmer&oacute;n* (1585), Francisco Ribera (1591), Prado (1595), Pereira (1610), Sancio (1628), Pineda (1637). In secular literature, mention may be made of <a href="../cathen/08189c.htm">de Isla</a> and Baltasar Graci&aacute;n (1584-1658), author of "The Art of Worldly Wisdom" (El or&aacute;culo) and "El criticon", which seems to have suggested the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of "Robinson Crusoe" to Defoe.

<p>Following the almost universal custom of the late seventeenth century, the kings of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> generally had <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> confessors; but their attempts at reform were too often rendered ineffective by court intrigues. This was especially the case with the Austrian, Father &mdash; later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> &mdash; Everard Nidhard (confessor of Maria Anna of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>) and Pere Daubenton, confessor of Philip V. After the era of the great writers, the chief glory of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> is to be found in their large and flourishing foreign missions in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, New Grenada, the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>, <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, which will be noted under "missions", below. There were served by 2171 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at the time of the Suppression. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> itself in 1749 was divided into five provinces: Toledo with 659 members, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, 718; <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, 604; Seville, 662; <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, 300; total 2943 members (1342 priests) in 158 houses.
<h3>Portugal</h3>

<p>At the time when Ignatius founded his order <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was in her heroic age. Her rulers were full of enterprise, her <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were full of life, her trade routes extended over the then known world. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were welcomed with enthusiasm, and made good use of their opportunities. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, traversing Portuguese colonies and settlements, proceeded to make his splendid missionary conquests. These were continued by his confreres in such distant lands as <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, the Congo, South Africa, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, by Fathers Nunhes, Silveria, <a href="../cathen/01108b.htm">Acosta</a>, Fernandes, and others. At Coimbra, and afterwards at <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> made the most surprising progress under such professors as Pedro de Fonseca (d. 1599), Luis Molina (d. 1600), Christov&atilde;o Gil, Sebast&atilde;o de Abreu, etc., and from here also comes the first comprehensive series of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> textbooks for students. (See <a href="../cathen/04252a.htm">CONIMBRICENSES</a>). With the advent of Spanish monarchy, 1581, the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> suffered no less than the rest of their country. Luis Carvalho joined the Spanish opponents of Father Acquaviva, and when the apostolic collector, Ottavio Accoramboni, launched an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> against the government of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, especially Diego de Arida, became involved in the undignified strife. One the other hand, they played an honorable part in the restoration of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal's</a> liberty in 1640, and on its success, the difficulty was to restrain King Jo&atilde;o IV from giving Father Manuel Fernandes a seat in the Cortes, and employing others in diplomatic missions. Among these Fathers were Antonio Vieira, one of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal's</a> most eloquent orators. Up to the Suppression, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and her colonists supported the following missions, of which further notices will be found elsewhere, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> (originally <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>), <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, Maranhao. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> provinces in 1749 numbered 861 members (381 priests) in 49 houses. (See also Vieira, Antonio; <a href="../cathen/09565c.htm">Gabriel Malagrida</a>.)
<h3>France</h3>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, although almost all <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, were trained and made their first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> have always been of exceptional importance for the body at large. In early years its young men were sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there as Ignatius had been. They were hospitably received by Guillaume de Prat, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Claremont, whose <em>h&ocirc;tel</em> grew into the Coll&egrave;ge de Clermont (1550), afterwards known as Luis-le-Grand. Padre Viola was the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, but the public classes did not begin until 1564. The <em>Parlement</em> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the Sorbonne resisted vehemently the letters patent, which Henry II and after him Francis II, and Charles IX had granted with little difficulty. Meanwhile the same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Claremont had founded a second college at Billom in his own diocese, which was opened 26 July, 1556, before the first general congregation. Colleges at Mauriac and Pamiers soon followed, and between 1565 and 1575, other at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, while Fathers Coudret, Auger, Roger, and Pelletier distinguished themselves by their apostolic labours. The utility of the order was also shown in the Colloquies at Poissy (1561) and at St-Germain-en-Laye by Fathers Lainez and <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevinus</a>, and again by Father Brouet, who, with two companions, gave his life in the service of plague-stricken <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1562, while Father Maldonado lectured with striking effect both at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>.

<p>Meantime serious trouble was growing up with the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> due to a number of petty causes, jealousy of the new teachers, rivalry with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Gallican resentment at the enthusiastic devotion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and perhaps a spice of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. A lawsuit for the closing of Claremont College was instituted before the <em>Parlement</em>, and Estienne Pasquier, counsel for the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, delivered a celebrated <em>plaidoyer</em> against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The parlement, though then favorable to the order, was anxious not to irritate the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and came to an indecisive settlement (5 April, 1565). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, despite the royal license, were not to be incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but they might continue their lectures. Unsatisfied with this, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> retaliated by preventing the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> scholars from obtaining degrees and later (1573-6), a feud was maintained against Father Maldonado (q.v.) which was eventually closed by the intervention of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> who had also in 1572 raised the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Pont-a-Mousson to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. But meantime, the more or less incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion were devastating the land, and from time to time, several <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, especially Auger and Manare, were acting as army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. They had no connection with the Massacre of St. Bartholomew (1572); but Maldonado was afterward deputed to receive <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> (afterward Henry IV) into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in many places the Fathers were able to shelter refugees in their houses; and by remonstrance and intercession, they saved many lives.

<p>Immediately after his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> (1575), Henry III chose Father Auger for his confessor, and for exactly two hundred years the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> court confessor became an institution in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and as French fashions were then influential, every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> court in time followed the precedent. Considering the difficulty of any sort of control over autocratic sovereigns, the institution of a court confessor was well adapted to the circumstances. The occasional abuses of the office which occurred are chiefly to be attributed to the exorbitant powers invested in the autocrat, which no human guidance could save from periods of decline and degradation.But this was more clearly seen later on. A crisis for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was near when, after the death of Fran&ccedil;ois, Duke of Anjou, 1584, Henri de Navarre, now an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, stood heir to the throne which the feeble Henry III could not possibly retain for long. Sides were taken with enthusiasm, and <em>La sainte ligue</em> was formed for the defense of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see League, The; <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>, House of; <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). It was hardly to be expected that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to a man would have remained cool, when the whole populace was in a ferment of excitement. It was morally impossible to keep the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> friends of the <em>exalt&eacute;s</em> on both sides from participating in their extreme measures. Auger and Claude Matthieu were respectively in the confidence of the two contending parties, the Court and the League. Father Acquaviva succeeded in withdrawing both from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, though with great difficulty and considerable loss of favor on either side. One or two he could not control for some time, and of these, the most remarkable was Henri Samerie, who had been <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, and became later army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. For a year he passed as diplomatic agent from one prince of the League to another, evading, by their means and the favor of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, all Acquaviva's efforts to get him back to regular life. But in the end, discipline prevailed, and Acquaviva's orders to respect the consciences of both sides enabled the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to keep friends with all.

<p>Henry IV made much use of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (especially Toledo, <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevinus</a>, and Commolet), although they had favored the League, to obtain canonical <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and the conclusion of peace; and in time (1604) took Pere Coton as his confessor. This, however, is an anticipation. After the attempt on Henri's life by Jean Chastel (27 December, 1594), the <em>Parlement</em> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> took the opportunity of attacking the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> with fury, perhaps to disguise the fact that they had been among the most extreme of the Leaguers, while the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was among the more moderate. It was pretended that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was responsible for Chastel's crime, because he had once been their student: though in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he was then at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The librarian of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, Jean Guignard, was hanged, 7 January, 1595, because an old book against the king was found in the cupboard of his room. Antoine* Arnauld, the elder, brought into his <em>plaidoyer</em> before the <em>Parlement</em> every possible <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were ordered to leave <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in three days and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in a fortnight. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was executed in the districts subject to the <em>Parlement</em> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but not elsewhere. The king, not yet being canonically absolved, did not then interfere. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and many others, pleaded earnestly for the revocation of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against the order. The matter was warmly debated and eventually Henry himself gave the permission for its readmission, on 1 September, 1603. He now made great use of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, founded for it the great College of La Feche, encouraged its missions at home, in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and B&eacute;arn, and the commencement of the foreign missions in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the Levant.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> immediately began to increase rapidly, and counted thirty-nine colleges, besides other houses, and 1135 religious before the king fell under Ravaillac's dagger (1610). This was made the occasion for new assaults by the <em>Parlement</em>, who availed themselves of Marianna's book, "De rege", to attack the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> as defenders of regicide. Francisco Su&aacute;rez's "Defensio fidei" was burnt in 1614. The young King, Louis XIII, was too weak to curb the <em>parlementaires</em>, but both he and the people of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> favored the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> so effectively that at the time of his death in 1643 their numbers had trebled. They now had five provinces, and that of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> alone counted over 13,000 scholars in its colleges. The confessors during this reign were changed not unfrequently by the manoeuvres of Richilieu, and included Peres Arnoux de S&eacute;guiron, Suffren, <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Caussin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a>, Dinet. Richilieu's policy of supporting the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (which <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Caussin</a> resisted) <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the occasion for angry polemics. The German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/08613a.htm">Jacob Keller</a> was believed (though <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of authorship is altogether wanting) to have written two strong pamphlets, "Mysteria politica", and "Admonitio ad Ludovicum XIII", against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The books were burned by the hangman, as in 1626 was a work of Father Santarelli, which touched awkwardly on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> power to pronounce against princes.

<p>The politico-religious history of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> centres round <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENIUS AND JANSENISM</a>) and the lives of the king's confessors, especially P&egrave;res <a href="../cathen/01537a.htm">Annat</a> (1845-60), Ferrier (1660-74), La Chaise (q.v.) (1674-1709), and <a href="../cathen/15311a.htm">Michel Le Tellier</a> (1709-15). On 24 May, 1656, <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Blaise Pascal</a> published the first of his "Provinciales". The five propositions of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> having been condemned by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> could no longer defend them openly, and found the most effective method of retaliation was satire, raillery, and countercharge against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. He concluded with the usual evasion that <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> did not write in the sense attributed to him by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The "Provinciales" were the first noteworthy example in the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> of satire written in studiously polite and moderate terms; and their great literary merit appealed powerfully to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of cleverness. Too light to be effectively answered by refutation, they were at the same time sufficiently envenomed to do great and lasting harm; although they have frequently been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to misrepresent the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> by omissions, alterations, interpolations, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> contexts, notably by Dr, Karl Weiss, of Gratz, "P. Antonio de Escobar y Mendoza als Moraltheologe in Pascals Beleuchtung und im Lichte der Wahrheit".

<p>The cause of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was also compromised by the various quarrels of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> with <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, especially concerning the <em>r&eacute;gale</em>, and the Gallican articles of 1682. (See <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">LOUIS XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">INNOCENT XI</a>. The different standpoint of these articles may help to illustrate the differences of view prevalent within the order on this subject.) At first there was a tendency on both sides to spare the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. They were not at that time asked to subscribe to the Gallican articles, while <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent</a> overlooked their adherence to the king, in hopes that their moderation might bring about peace. But it was hardly possible that they should escape all troubles under a domination so pressing. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of uniting all the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> under a vicar, independent of the general in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Before making this known, he recalled all his <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> subjects, and all, even the assistant, Pere Fontaine, returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Then he proposed the separation, which Thyrsus Gonz&aacute;lez* formally refused. The <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> of the five <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> provinces implored the king to desist, which he eventually did. It has been alleged that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> forbidding the reception of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> between 1684-6 was issued in punishment of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> giving support to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis</a> (<a href="../cathen/04488a.htm">Cretineau-Joly</a>). The matter is alluded to in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of Suppression; but it is still obscure and would seem rather to be connected with the Chinese rites than with the difficulties in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Except for the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> on their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1716-29, by <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, the fortunes of the order were very calm and prosperous during the ensuing generation. In 1749, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were divided into five provinces with members as follows: <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 891; Acquitane, 437; Lyons 772; <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> 655; Champagne, 594; total 3350 (1763 priests) in 158 houses.
<h3>Germany</h3>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> to labour here was Bl. Peter Faber, who won to their ranks Bl. Peter Canisius, to whose lifelong diligence and eminent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> the rise and prosperity of the German provinces are especially due. In 1556, there were two provinces, South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (<em>Germania Superior</em>, up to and including <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>) and North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (<em>Germania Inferior</em>, including <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>). The first residence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was at Cologne (1544), the first college at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1552). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> were soon so popular that they were demanded on every side, faster than they could be supplied, and the greater groups of these became fresh provinces. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> branched off in 1563, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in 1623, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> had become two separate provinces by 1612, and Rhineland also two provinces by 1626. At that time the five German-speaking provinces numbered over 100 colleges and academies. But meanwhile all <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was in turmoil with the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, which had gone so far, generally, in favor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> powers. In 1629 came the <em>Restitutionsedikt</em> (see <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>) by which the emperor redistributed with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction the old <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> which had been recovered from the usurpation of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> received large grants, but was not much benefited thereby. Some bitter controversies ensued with the ancient holders of the properties, who were often <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>; and many of the acquisitions were lost again during the next period of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.

<p>The sufferings of the order during the second period were grievous. Even before the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> they had been systematically <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and driven into exile by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, whenever these had the opportunity. In 1618 they were banished from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and Silesia; and after the advent of Gustavus Adolphus the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to which they were liable increased. The fanatical proposal of banishing them forever from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was made by him in 1631, and again at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a> in 1633; and this counsel of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> acquired a hold which it still exercises over the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mind. The initial success of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of course excited further antipathies, especially as the great generals <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly</a>, Wallenstein, and Piccolomini had been <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> pupils. During the siege of Prague, 1648, Father Plachy successfully trained a corps of students for the defense of the town, and was awarded the mural crown for his services. The province of Upper Rhine alone lost seventy-seven Fathers in field <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or during the fighting. After the peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 1648, the tide of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> had more or less spent itself. The foundation period had passed and there are few external events to chronicle. The last notable conversion was that of Prince Frederick Augustus of Saxony (1697), afterwards King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Fathers Vota and <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> (afterwards a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) were intimately connected with his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. Within the walls of their colleges and in the churches throughout the country the work of teaching, writing and preaching continued unabated, while the storms of controversy rose and fell, and the distant missions, especially <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and the Spanish missions of South America, claimed scores of the noblest and most high-spirited. To this period belong Philip Jenigan (d. 1704) and <a href="../cathen/07562a.htm">Franz Hunolt</a> (d. 1740), perhaps the greatest German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> preachers; <a href="../cathen/15079c.htm">Tschupick</a>, Joseph Sneller, and Ignatius Wurz acquired an almost equally great reputation in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In 1749, the German provinces counted as follows: <em>Germania Superior</em>, 1060; Lower Rhine, 772; Upper Rhine, 497; Austria, 1772; <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> 1239; total 5340 members (2558 priests) in 307 houses. (See also the index volume under the title "Society of Jesus", and such names as <a href="../cathen/02380a.htm">Becan</a>, Byssen, <a href="../cathen/02803b.htm">Brouwer</a>, Dreschel, <a href="../cathen/06244a.htm">Lohner</a>, etc.)

<p>Hungary was included in the province of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The chief patron of the order was Cardinal P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny. The conversion of Sweden was several times attempted by German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, but they were not allowed to stay in the country. King John III, however, who had married a Polish princess, was actually converted (1578) through several missions by Fathers Warsiewicz and <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevinus</a>, the latter accompanied by the English Father William Good; but the king had not the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to persevere. Queen Christina (q.v.) in 1654 was brought into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, largely through the ministrations of Fathers Macedo and Casati, having given up her throne for this purpose. The Austrian Fathers maintained a small residence at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> from 1684 to 1718, which had been opened by Father Vota. (See <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">POSSEVINUS</a>).
<h3>Poland</h3>

<p>Bl. Peter Canisius, who visited <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in the train of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Mantuato in 1558, succeeded in animating King Sigismund to energetic defense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Bishop Hosius of Ermland</a> founded the College of Braunsburg in 1584, which with that of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> (1569) became centres of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> activity in northeastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. King Stephen Bathory, an earnest patron of the order, founded a <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> College at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> in 1575. From 1588, <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Father Peter Skarga</a> (d. 1612) made a great impression by his preaching. There were violent attacks against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in the revolution of 1607, but after the victory of Sigismund III the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> more than recovered the ground lost; and in 1608 the province could be subdivided into <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The animus against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> however, vented itself in Cracow in 1612, through the scurrilous satire entitled "Monita secreta", (q.v.). King Casimir, who had once been a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, favored the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> not a little; so too did <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">Sobieski</a>, and his campaign to relieve <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1683) was due in part to the exhortations of Father Vota, his confessor. Among the great Polish missionaries are numbered Benedict Herbst (d. 1593) and <a href="../cathen/01472c.htm">Bl. Andrew Bobola</a>. In 1756 the Polish provinces were readjusted into four: Greater <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Lesser <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, Massovia, counting in all 2359 religious. The Polish <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, besides their own missions, had others in <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the Crimea, Constantinople, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. (See Cracow, University of.)
<h3>Belgium</h3>

<p>The first settlement was at Louvaun in 1542, whither the students in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> retired on the declaration of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1556 <a href="../cathen/13029a.htm">Ribadeneira</a> obtained legal authorization for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> from Philip II, and in 1564 <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> became a separate province. Its beginning, however, were by no means uniformly prosperous. The <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a> was cold and suspicious, while the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the revolting provinces told heavily against it. At the pacification of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> (1576), the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were offered an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> against the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, which they firmly refused, and were driven from their houses. But this at last won for them Philip's favor, and under Alexander Farnese fortune turned completely in their favour. Father Oliver Manare became a leader fitted for the occasion, whom Acquaviva himself greeted as "Pater Provinciae". In a few years, a number of well-established colleges had been founded, and in 1612 the Province had to be subdivided. The <em>Flandro-Belgica</em> counted sixteen colleges and the <em>Gallo-Belgica</em> eighteen. All but two were day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with no preparatory colleges for small boys. They were worked with comparatively small staffs of five or six, sometimes only three professors, though their scholars might count as many hundreds. Teaching was gratuitous, but a sufficient foundation for the support of the teachers was a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> preliminary. Though preparatory and elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was not yet in fashion, the care taken in teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> was most elaborate. The classes were regular, and at intervals enlivened with music, ceremonies, mystery plays, and processions. These were often attended by the whole magistracy in robes of state, while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself would attend at the distribution of honours. A special congregation was formed at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1648, to organize ladies and gentlemen, nobles and bourgeois, into Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> teachers, and in that year their classes counted in all 3000 children. Similar organizations existed all over the country. The first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a> classes formed an extension of the catechisms. In <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and Antwerp, between 600 and 1600 attended the communion classes.

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> congregations of the Blessed Virgin were first instituted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, John Leunis, in 1563. His native country soon took them up with enthusiasm. Each college had normally four: <ul><li>for scholars (more often two, one for older, one for younger); <li>for young men on leaving; <li>for grown-up men (more often several) &#151; for workingmen, for tradesmen, professional classes, nobles, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, etc., etc.; <li>for small boys.</ul> In days before <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, workhouses, and elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> were regularly organized, and supported by the State; before burial-clubs, trade-unions, and the like provided special help for the working man, these sodalities discharged the functions of such institutions, in homely fashion perhaps, but gratuitously, bringing together all ranks for the relief of indigence. Some of these congregations were exceedingly popular, and their registers still show the names of the first artists and savants of the time (<a href="../cathen/14507b.htm">Teniers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, Lipsius, etc.). Archdukes and kings and even four emperors are found among the sodalists of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Probably the first permanent corps of Army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> was that established by Farnese in 1587. It consisted of ten to twenty-five <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and was styled the "Missio castrensis," and lasted as an institution until 1660. The "Missio navalis" was a kindred institution for the navy. The Flandro-Belgian province numbered 542 in 1749 (232 priests) in 30 houses: Gallo-Belgian, 471 (266 priests) in 25 houses.
<h3>England</h3>

<p>Founded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after the English <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had commenced, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had great difficulty in finding an entrance into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, though Ignatius and <a href="../cathen/13029a.htm">Ribadeneira</a> visited the country in 1531 and 1558, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for its conversion have been recited throughout the order to the present day (now under the common designation of "Northern Nations"). Other early <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> exerted themselves on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> and of the refugees at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. The effect of Elizabeth's expulsion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from Oxford, 1562-75, was that many took refuge abroad. Some scores of young men entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, several of these volunteered for foreign missions, and thus it came about that the forerunner of those legions of <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">Englishmen</a> who go into <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> to carve out careers was the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, Thomas Stevens. John Yate (<em>alias</em> Vincent, b. 1550; died after 1603) and John Meade (see Almeida) were pioneers of the mission to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. The most noteworthy of the first recruits were Thomas Darbishire and William Good, followed in time by <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a> and <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Robert Persons</a>. The latter was the first to conceive and elaborate the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the English mission, which, at Dr. Allen's request, was undertaken in December, 1578.

<p>Before this the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had undertaken care of the English College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see English College), by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> command, 19 March, 1578. But difficulties ensued owing to the miseries inherent in the estate of the religious refugees. Many came all the way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> expecting pensions, or scholarships from the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, who at first became, in spite of himself, the dispenser of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory's</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> soon failed, and several scholars had to be dismissed as unworthy. Hence disappointments and storms of grumbling, the records of which read sadly by the side of the consoling accounts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of men like <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a>, <a href="../cathen/14688a.htm">Cottam</a>, <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Southwell</a>, <a href="../cathen/15540a.htm">Walpole</a>, Page, and others, and the labours of a Hetward, Weston, or <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">Gerard</a>. <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a> and Crichton too, falling in with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, so common abroad, that a counter-revolution in favor of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> would not be difficult, made two or three political missions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1582-84) before realizing that their schemes were not feasible (see <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">PERSONS</a>). After the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Armada</a>, <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a> induced Philip to establish more <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and hence the foundations at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, St-Omer, and Seville (1589, 1592, 1593), all put in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On the other hand they suffered a setback in the so-called Appellant Controversy (1598-1602) which French diplomacy in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> eventually made into an opportunity for operating against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. (See Blackwell; Garnet.) The assistance of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the influence of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> were now on the whole highly beneficial. But many who took refuge at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> became accustomed to a Gallican atmosphere, and hence perhaps some of the regalist views about the Oath of Allegiance, and some of the excitement in the debate over the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Bishops of Chalcedon, of which more below. The feelings of tension continued until the missions of Pizzani, Conn, and Rosetti, 1635-41. Though the first of these was somewhat hostile, he was recalled in 1637, and his successors brought about a peace, too soon to be interrupted by the Civil War, 1641-60.

<p>Before 1606, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had founded houses for others, but neither they nor any other English order had erected houses for themselves. But during the so-called "Foundation Movement", due to many causes but especially perhaps to the stimulation of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a full equipment of institutions was established in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> began at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1606, was moved to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1614, and in 1622 to Watten. The house at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> was continued as the scholasticate, and the house of third probation was at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> 1620. The "mission" was made in 1619 a vice-province, and on 21 January, 1623, a province, with Fr. Richard Blout as first provincial; and in 1634 it was able to undertake the foreign mission of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> (see below) in the old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at this period also reached their greatest numbers. In 1621, they were 211, in 1636, 374. In the latter year, their total revenue amount to 45,086 <em>scudi</em> (about 5760 English pounds in 1913). After the civil War both members and revenue fell off very considerably. In 1649 there were only 264 members, and 23,055 <em>scudi</em> revenue (about 5760 pounds); in 1645, the revenue was only 17,405 <em>scudi</em> (about 4350 pounds).

<p>Since Elizabeth's time the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> had been few--one only, the <a href="../cathen/05293b.htm">Ven. Edmund Arrowsmith</a> in the reign of Charles I. On 26 October, 1623, had occurred "The Doleful Even-song". A congregation had gathered for vespers in the garret of the French embassy in Blackfriars, when the floor gave way. Fathers <a href="../cathen/05165a.htm">Drury</a> and Rediate with 61 (perhaps 100) of the congregation were killed. On 14 March, 1628, seven <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were seized at St. John's Clerkenwell, with a large number of papers. These troubles, however, were light, compared with the sufferings during the Commonwealth, when the list of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors went up to ten. As the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> depended so much on the country <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, they were sure to suffer severely by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and the college at St-Omar was nearly beggared. The old trouble about the Oath of Allegiance was revived by the Oath of Abjuration, and the "three questions" proposed by Fairfax, 1 August 1647 (see <a href="../cathen/15613c.htm">THOMAS WHITE</a>). The representatives of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, amongst them <a href="../cathen/10564c.htm">Father Henry More</a>, were called upon at short notice to subscribe to them. They did so, More thinking he might, "considering the reasons of the preamble", which qualified the words of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> considerably. But the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, Fr. Silesdon, recall him from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and he was kept out of office for a year; a punishment which, even if drastic for his offence, cannot be regretted, as it providentially led to his writing the history of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> down to the year 1635 ("Hist, missionis anglicanae Soc. Jesu, ab anno salutis MDLXXX", St-Omer, 1660).

<p>With the Restoration, 1660, came a period of greater calm, followed by the worst tempest of all, <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">Oates's plot</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> lost eight on the scaffold and thirteen in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in five years, 1678-83. Then the period of greatest prosperity under King James II (1685-8). He gave then a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, and a public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Somerset House, made Father Petri his almoner, and on 11 November, 1687, a member of his Privy Council. He also chose Father Warner as his confessor, and encouraged the preaching and controversies which were carried on with no little fruit. But this spell of prosperity lasted only a few months; with the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a>, the Fathers regained their patrimony of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to die in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> were Fathers Poulton and Aylworth (1690-1692). William III's repressive legislation did not have the intended effect of exterminating the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but it did reduce them to a proscribed and ostracized body. Thenceforward the annals of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> show little that is new or striking, though their number and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> were well-maintained. Most of the Fathers in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to gentlemen's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, of which posts they held nearly a hundred during the eighteenth century.

<p>The church law under which the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> worked was to some extent special. At first indeed all was undefined, seculars and regulars living in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> happy-family style. As, however, organization developed, friction between parts could not always be avoided, and legislation became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. By the institution of the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> (7 March, 1598), and by the subsequent modifications of the institution (6 April, 1599; 17 August, 16701; and 5 October, 1602), various occasions for friction were removed, and principles for stable government were introduced. As soon as Queen Henrietta Maria seemed able to protect a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Chalcedon <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a></em> were sent, in 1623 and 1625. The second of these, Dr. Richard Smith, endeavored, without having the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> faculty from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to introduce the episcopal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of confessors. This lead to the brief "Britannica", 9 May, 1631 which left the faculties of regular missionaries in their previous immediate dependence on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. But after the institution of <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> in 1685, by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 9 October, 1695, regulars were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There were of course many other matters that needed settlement, but the difficulties of the position in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the distance from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> made legislation slow and difficult. In 1745 and 1748 decrees were obtained, against which appeals were lodged; and it was not till 31 May, 1753, that the "Regulae missionis" were laid down by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in the Constitution "Apostolicum ministerium", which regulated <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration until the issuance of the Constitution "Romanos Pontifices" in 1881. In the year of the suppression, 1773, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> numbered 274. (See <a href="../cathen/04093b.htm">EDWARD COFFIN</a>; <a href="../cathen/04487a.htm">CRESWELL</a>; <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">ENGLISH CONFESSORS AND MARTYRS</a>; <a href="../cathen/10564c.htm">HENRY MORE</a>; <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">PENAL LAWS</a>; <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">ROBERT PERSONS</a>; SIR EDWARD PETRE; PLOWDEN; <a href="../cathen/13291b.htm">LOUIS DE SABRAN</a>; SOUTHWELL; JOHN SPENCER; <a href="../cathen/14292a.htm">THOMAS STEPHENS</a>; REDFORD.)
<h3>Ireland</h3>

<p>One of the first commissions which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was that of acting as envoys to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Father Salmeron and Brouet managed to reach Ulster during the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 1542; but the immense difficulties of the situation after <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> successes of 1541 made it impossible for them to live there in safety, much less to discharge the functions or to commence the reforms which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had entrusted to them. Under <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> would have returned, had there been men ready. There were indeed already a few <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and of these David Woulfe returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on 20 January, 1561, with ample Apostolic faculties. He procured candidates for the sees emptied by Elizabeth, kept open a grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for some years, and sent several <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> to the order; but he was finally <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and had to withdraw to the continent. A little later the "Irish mission" was regularly organized under <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> superiors, beginning with Fr. Richard Fleming (d. 1590), professor at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> College, and then Chancellor of the University of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson.In 1609, the mission numbered seventy-two, forty of whom were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and eighteen were at work in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. By 1617 this latter number had increased to thirty eight; the rest were for the most part in training among their French and Spanish confreres. The foundation of the colleges abroad, at Salamanca, Santiago, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was chiefly due to Father Thomas White (d. 1622). They were consolidated and long managed by Fr. James Archer of Kilkenny, afterwards missionary in Ulster and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Hugh O'Neill. The <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> was also under <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> direction, as was that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for some time (see <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>).

<p>The greatest extension in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was naturally during the dominance of the Confederation (1542-54) with which Father Matthew O'Hartigan was in great favour. <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and residences then amounted to thirteen, with a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Kilkenny. During the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> domination, the number of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> fell again to eighteen, but in 1685, under James II there were twenty-eight with seven residences. After the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a>, their number fell again to six, and then rose to seventeen in 1717, and to twenty-eight in 1755. The Fathers sprang mostly from the old Anglo-Norman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, but almost all the missionaries spoke <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and missionary labour was the chief occupation of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Fr. Robert Rochford set up a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Youdal as early as 1575; <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was given in Dublin in the reign of Charles I, until the buildings were seized and handed over to Trinity College; and Father John Austin kept a flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Dublin for twenty-two years before the Suppression.

<p>Some account of the work of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> will be found in the articles on Father Christopher Holywood and Henry Fitzsimon; but it was abroad, from the nature of the case, that <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> genius of that day found it widest recognition. <a href="../cathen/15612c.htm">Stephen White</a>, Luke <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, cousin of his <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">famous Franciscan namesake</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>; Andrew and Peter <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> at Dilligen and Gratz respectively; J, B, Duiggin and John Lombard at Ypres and Antwerp; Thomas Comerford at Compostella; Paul Sherlock at Salamanca; Richard Lynch (1611-76) at Valladolid and Salamanca; James Kelly at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Peter Plunket at <a href="../cathen/09131a.htm">Leghorn</a>. Among the distinguished writers were <a href="../cathen/02348a.htm">William Bathe</a>, whose "Janua linguarum" (Salamanca, 1611) was the basis of the work of Commenius. Bertrand Routh (b. at Kilkenny, 1695) was a writer in the "M&eacute;moires de Tr&eacute;voux" (1734-43), and assisted Montesquieu on his death-bed. In the field of foreign mission, O'Fihily was one of the first apostles of Paraguay, and Thomas Lynch was <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> at the time of the Suppression. At this time also, Roger Magloire was working in <a href="../cathen/09731a.htm">Martinique</a>, and Philip O'Reilly in <a href="../cathen/07062a.htm">Guiana</a>. But it was the mission-field in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> itself of which the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> thought most, to which all else, in one way or other lead up. Their labours were principally spent in the walled cities of the old English Pale. Here they kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> vigorous, in spite of persecutions, which, if sometimes intermitted, were nevertheless long and severe. The first <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was Edmund O'Donnell who suffered at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> in 1575. Others on that list of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> are: Dominic Collins, a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, Youghal, 1602; William Boynton, Cahel, 1647; Fathers Netterville and <a href="../cathen/02348a.htm">Bathe</a>, at the fall of Drogheda, 1649. Father David Gallway worked among the scattered and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Gaels of the Scottish Isles and Highlands, until his death in 1643. (See also FITSIMON; MALONE; O'DONNELL; <a href="../cathen/14432c.htm">PETER TALBOT</a>; <a href="../cathen/08163a.htm">IRISH CONFESSORS AND MARTYRS</a>.)
<h3>Scotland</h3>

<p>Father Nicholas de Gouda was sent to visit <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a> in 1562 to invite her to send <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The power of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> made it impossible to achieve this object, but de Gouda conferred with the Queen and brought back with him six young Scots, who were to prove the founders of the mission. Of these Edmund Hay soon rose to prominence and was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> College, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1584, Crichton returned with Father James Gordon, uncle of the Earl of Huntly, to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>; the former was captured, but the latter was extraordinarily successful, and the Scottish mission proper may be said to have begun with him, and Father Edmund Hay and John Drury, who came in 1585. The Earl of Huntly became the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leader, and the fortunes of his party passed through many a strange turn. But the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> victory of Glenlivet, in 1594, aroused the temper of the Kirk to such a pitch that James, though averse to severity, was forced to advance against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lords and eventually Huntly was constrained to leave the country, and then, returning he submitted to the Kirk in 1597. This put a term to the spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; Father James Gordon had to leave in 1595, but Father Abercrombie succeeded in reconciling Anne of Denmark, who, however, did not prove a very <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> convert. Meantime the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had been given the management of the Scots College founded by <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which was successively removed to Pont-a-Mousson and to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. In 1600 another college was founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and put under them, and there was also a small one at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>.

<p>After reaching the English throne, James was bent on introducing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> into <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and to reconcile the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a> to this he allowed them to persecute the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to their hearts' content. By their barbarous <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">"excommunication"</a>, the suffering they inflicted was incredible. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the resistance to this cruelty was Father James Anderson, who, however, becoming the object of special searches, had to be withdrawn in 1611. In 1614, Fathers John Ogilvie and James Moffat were sent in, the former suffering <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, 10 March 1615. In 1620, Father Patrick Anderson was tried, but eventually banished. After this, a short period of peace, 1625-27, ensued, followed by another <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, 1629-30, and another period of peace before the rising of the Covenanters, and the Civil Wars, 1638-45. There were about six Fathers in the mission at the time, some <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentry, some living the then wild life of the Highlanders, especially during Montrose's campaigns. But after Philiphaugh (1645), the fortunes of the royalists and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> underwent a sad change. Among those who fell into the hands of the enemy was Father Andrew Leslie, who has left a lively account of his prolonged sufferings in various <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>. After the Restoration (1660) there was a new period of peace in which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries reaped a considerable harvest, but during the disturbances caused by the Covenanters the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was renewed. James II favored them as far as he could, appointing Fathers James Forbes and Thomas Patterson <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> at <a href="../cathen/07423a.htm">Holyrood</a>, where a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was also opened. After the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a>, the Fathers were scattered, but returned, though with diminishing numbers.
<h2>Missions</h2>

<p>No sphere of religious activity is held in greater esteem among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> than that of the foreign missions; and from the beginning, men of the highest gifts, like <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, have been devoted to this work. Hence perhaps it is that a better <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> may be formed of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> missions by reading the lives of its great missionaries, which will be found under their respective names (see the Index), than from the following notice, in which attention has to be confined to general topics.
<h3>India</h3>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> began, the great colonizing powers were <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The career of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, so far as its <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">geographical</a> direction and limits were concerned, was largely determined by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> settlements in the East, and by the trade routes followed by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> merchants. Arriving at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in 1542, he evangelized first the western coast and <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>; in 1545 he was in <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>; in 1549 in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. At the same time he pushed forward his few assistants and catechists into other centers, and in 1552 set out for <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but died at the year's end on an island off the coast. Xavier's work was carried on, with Gao as headquarters, and Father Barzaeus as successor. Father Antonio Criminali, the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had suffered in 1549 and Father Mendez followed in 1552. In 1559, Blessed Rudolph Acquiviva visited the court of Akbar the Great, but without permanent effect. The great impulse of conversions came after <a href="../cathen/11086a.htm">Ven. Robert de Nobili</a> declared himself a Brahmin <em>Sannjasi</em> and lived the life of the Brahmins (1606). At Tanjore and elsewhere he now made immense numbers of converts, who were allowed to keep the distinctions of their caste, with many religious customs; which, however, were eventually (after much controversy) condemned by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1744. This condemnation produced a depressing effect on the mission, though at the very time Fathers Lopez and Acosta with singular heroism devoted themselves for life to the service of the Pariahs. The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">Suppression of the Society</a>, which followed soon after, completed the desolation of a once prolific missionary field. (See <a href="../cathen/09558b.htm">MALABAR RITES</a>.) From Gao too were organized missions to the east coast of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> mission, under Father Nunhes, <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>, and Paes lasted, with various fortunes, over a century 1555-1690 (See <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, I, 76). The <a href="../cathen/15746c.htm">mission on the Zambesi</a> under Father Silviera, Acosta, and Fernandez was but short lived; so too was the work of Father Govea in <a href="../cathen/01512b.htm">Angola</a>. In the seventeenth century, the missionaries penetrated into <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, Fathers Desideri and Freyre reaching Lhasa. Others pushed out in the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> mission, from Ormus as far as <a href="../cathen/08192b.htm">Ispahan</a>. About 1700 the Persian missions counted 400,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The southern and eastern coasts of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, with Ceylon, were comprised after 1610 in the separate province of Malabar, with an independent French mission at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. Malabar numbered forty-seven missionaries (Portuguese) before the Suppression, while the French missions counted 22. (See <a href="../cathen/07131a.htm">HANXLEDEN</a>).
<h3>Japan</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> mission (see <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, VIII, 306) gradually developed into a province, but the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and seat of government remained at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>. By 1582, the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was estimated at 200,000, with 250 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and 59 missionaries, of whom 23 were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 26 <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> had been admitted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. But 1587 saw the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and about the same period began the rivalries of nations and of competing orders. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> crown had been assumed by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and Spanish merchants introduced <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> at first forbade this (28 January, 1585) but <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (12 December, 1600; 11 June 1608) relaxed and repealed the prohibition, and the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Taico-sama quenched in blood whatever discontent might have arisen in consequence. The first great slaughter of 26 missionaries at <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a> took place on 5 Feb., 1597. Then came fifteen years of comparative peace, and gradually the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> rose to about 1,800,000 and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries to 140 (63 priests). In 1612, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out again, increasing in severity until 1622, when over 120 <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> suffered. The "great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>" took place on 20 September, when Blessed Charles Spinola suffered with representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. For the twenty ensuing years, the massacre continued without mercy, all <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who landed being at once executed. In 1644 Father Gaspar de Amaral was drowned in attempting to land, and his death brought to a close the century of missionary effort which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had made to bring the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. The name of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> province was retained, and it counted 57 subjects in 1660; but the mission was really confined to Tonkin and Cochin-China, whence stations were established in Annam, <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>, etc. (see Indo-China, VII, 774-5; Martyrs, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>).
<h3>China</h3>

<p>A detailed account of this mission from 1552-1773 will be found under <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">CHINA</a> (III, 672-4) and Martyrs in <a href="../cathen/09746b.htm">MARTYRS IN CHINA</a>, and in lives of the missionaries Bouvet, <a href="../cathen/02737b.htm">Brancati</a>, <a href="../cathen/03370a.htm">Carneiro</a>, <a href="../cathen/03767b.htm">Cibot</a>, <a href="../cathen/06303a.htm">Fridelli</a>, <a href="../cathen/06393b.htm">Gaubil</a>, <a href="../cathen/06471a.htm">Gerbillon</a>, <a href="../cathen/07253a.htm">Herdtrich</a>, <a href="../cathen/07358a.htm">Hinderer</a>, Mailla, Martini, <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a>, <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Schall von Bell</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15346a.htm">Verbiest</a> (qq.v.). From 1581, when the mission was organized, it consisted of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> Fathers. They established four colleges, one <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and some forty stations under a vice-provincial who resided frequently at Pekin; at the Suppression there were 54 Fathers. From 1687 there was a special mission of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Pekin, under their own superior; at the Suppression they numbered 23.
<h3>Central and South America</h3>

<p>The missions of Central and South America were divided between <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (see America, I, 414). In 1549, Father Numbrega and five companions, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. Progress was slow at first, but when the languages had been learnt, and the confidence of the natives acquired, progress became rapid. <a href="../cathen/07639b.htm">Blessed Ignacio de Azevedo</a> and his thirty-one companions were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> on their way thither in 1570. The missions, however, prospered steadily under such leaders as Jos&eacute; Anchieta and John Almeida (qq.v.) (Meade). In 1630, there were 70,000 converts. Before the Suppression, the whole country had been divided into missions, served by 445 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and 146 in the vice-province of Maranh&atilde;o.
<h3>Paraguay</h3>

<p>Of the Spanish missions, the most noteworthy is Paraguay (see Guarani Indians; <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abipones</a>; <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a>; Reductions of Paraguay). The province contained 584 members (of whom 385 were priests) before the Suppression, with 113,716 Indians under their charge.
<h3>Mexico</h3>

<p>Even larger than Paraguay was the missionary province of Mexico, which included <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, with 572 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and 122,000 Indians. (See also <a href="../cathen/03177b.htm">CALIFORNIA MISSIONS</a>; <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">MEXICO</a>; A&Ntilde;AZCO; CLAVIGERO; D&Iacute;AZ; <a href="../cathen/03402c.htm">DUCRUE</a>; etc.) The conflict as to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (1647) with <a href="../cathen/11414a.htm">Juan de la Palafox y Mendoza</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of La Puebla, led to an appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which was decided by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> in 1648, but afterward became a <em>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre.</em> The other Spanish missions, <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada (Colombia)</a>, <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> (<a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>), were administered by 193, 242, 526, and 209 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> respectively (see <a href="../cathen/01281e.htm">ALEGRE</a>; <a href="../cathen/01679b.htm">ARAUCANIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/01680c.htm">ARAWAKS</a>; <a href="../cathen/02308a.htm">BARRASA</a>; <a href="../cathen/10606b.htm">MOXOS INDIANS</a>).
<h3>United States</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father Andrew White</a> and four other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from the English missions arrived in territory now comprised in the state of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 25 March, 1634, with the expedition of <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">Cecil Calvert</a>. For ten years they ministered to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of the colony, converted many of its <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> pioneers, and conducted missions with the Indians along Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River, the Patuxents, Anacostans, and Piscaways, which last were especially friendly. In 1644 the colony was invaded by the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> from the neighboring settlement of <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father White</a> was sent in chains to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, tried for being a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and on his release took refuge in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Although the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonists soon regained control, they were constantly menaced by their <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> neighbours and by malcontents in the colony itself, who finally in 1692 succeeded in seizing the government, and in enacting a penal law against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, particularly against their <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which became more and more intolerable until the colony became the state of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1776. During the 140 years between their arrival in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">Suppression of the Society</a>, the missionaries, averaging four in number the first forty years, and then gradually increasing to twelve and then about twenty, continued their work among the Indians and the Settlers despite every vexation and disability, though prevented from increasing in number and extending their labours during the dispute with <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">Cecil Calvert</a> over retaining the tract of land, Mattapany, given then by the Indians, relief from taxation on lands devoted to religious or charitable purposes, and the usual <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunity for themselves and their households. The controversy ended in the cession of the Mattapany tract, the missionaries retaining the land they had acquired by the condition of plantation. Prior to the Suppression, they had established missions in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, at St. Thomas, White Marsh, St. Inigoes, Leonardtown still (1912) under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and also at <a href="../cathen/04674b.htm">Deer</a> Creek, Frederick, and St. Joseph's <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> Manor besides the many less permanent stations among the Indians in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, Philadelphia, Conewego, Lancaster, Gosenhoppen, and the excursion stations as far as New York, where two of their number, Fathers Harvey and Harrison assisted for a time by Father Gage had, under <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Governor Dongan</a> ministered as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> in the forts and among the white settlers, and attempted unsuccessfully to establish a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> between 1683-89, when they were forced to retire by an anti-Catholic administration.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">Suppression of the Society</a> altered but little the status of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. As they were the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the mission, they still remained at their posts, the nine English members, until death, all continuing to labor under Father John Lewis who after the Suppression had received the powers of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> from Bishop Calloner of the London District. Only two of them survived until the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>--Robert Molyneux and John Bolton. Many of those who were abroad, labouring in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or studying in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, returned to work in the mission. As a corporate body, they still retained the properties from which they derived support for their religious ministrations. As their numbers decreased, some of the missions were abandoned, or served for a time by other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but maintained by the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> properties even after the <a href="../cathen/14099a.htm">Restoration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Though these properties were regarded as reverting to it through its former members organized as the Corporation of Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, a yearly allowance from the revenues made over to Archbishop Carroll became during Bishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal's administration (1817-34) the basis of a claim for such a payment in perpetuity and the dispute thus occasioned was not settled until 1838 under <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a>.
<h3>French missions</h3>

<p>The French missions had as bases the French colonies in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the Antilles, <a href="../cathen/07062a.htm">Guiana</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; while the French influence in the Mediterranean led to missions of the Levant, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> among the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, etc. (See also Guiana; Haiti; Martinique; <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, III, 673.) The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> mission is described under <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and Missions, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian, of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. (See also the accounts of the missions given in articles on <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> like the Abenakis, Cree, <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a>, <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, Ottawas; and the biographies of the missionaries <a href="../cathen/02207a.htm">Bailloquet</a>, Br&eacute;beuf, <a href="../cathen/03402c.htm">Casot</a>, <a href="../cathen/03551a.htm">Chabanel</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637c.htm">Chastellain</a>, <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Chaumonot</a>, <a href="../cathen/03695b.htm">Cholonec</a>, <a href="../cathen/04484a.htm">Cr&eacute;pieul</a>, <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Dablon</a>, Cruillettes, Garnier, <a href="../cathen/06684a.htm">Goupil</a>, Jogues, <a href="../cathen/08739a.htm">Lafitau</a>, Lagren&eacute;, Jacques-P. Lallemant, Lamberville, <a href="../cathen/09044a.htm">Lauzon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Le Moyne</a>, <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">R&acirc;le</a>, etc.) In 1611, Fathers <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Biard</a> and Mass&eacute; arrived as missionaries at Port Royal, Acadia. Taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> by the English from <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, they were sent back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1614. In 1625, Fathers Mass&eacute;, Br&eacute;beuf, and <a href="../cathen/08752a.htm">Charles Lalemant</a> came to work in and about Quebec, until 1629, when they were forced to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> after the English captured Quebec. Back again in 1632, they began the most heroic missionary period in the annals of America. They opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Quebec in 1635 with a staff of most accomplished professors from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. For forty years, men quite as accomplished, labouring under incredible hardships, opened missions among the Indians on the coast, along the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and the Saguenay, and Hudson Bay; among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, Neutral Nation, <a href="../cathen/11784b.htm">Petuns</a>, <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, Ottawas, and later among the Miamis, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and the tribes east of the Mississippi as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. When <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> became a British possession in 1763, these missions could no longer be sustained, though many of them, especially those that formed part of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> settlements had gradually been taken over by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The college at Quebec was closed in 1768. At the time of the Suppression. there were but twenty-one <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the last of whom, <a href="../cathen/03402c.htm">Father John J. Casot</a>, died in 1800. The mission has become famous for its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, eight of whom, Brebeuf, <a href="../cathen/08752b.htm">Gabriel Lalemant</a>, Daniel, Garnier, <a href="../cathen/03551a.htm">Chabanel</a>, Jogues and his lay companions <a href="../cathen/06684a.htm">Goupil</a> and Lalande were declared venerable on 27 February, 1912. It has also become noted for its literary remains, especially for the works of the missionaries in the Indian tongues, for their explorations, especially that of Marquette, and for its "Relations."
<h3>Jesuit Relations</h3>

<p>The collections known as "Jesuit Relations" consist of letters written from members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in the mission field to their superiors and brethren in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and contain accounts of the development of the missions, and the obstacles which they encountered in their work. In March, 1549, when <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> confided the mission of Ormus to Father Gaspar Barzaeus, he included among his instructions the commission to write from time to time to the college at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, giving an account of what was being done in Ormus. His letter to Joam Beira (Malacca, 20 June, 1540), recommends similar accounts being sent to St. Ignatius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Father Simon Rodriguez at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and is very explicit concerning both the content and the tone of these accounts. The instructions were the guide for the future "Relations sent from all the foreign missions of the order. The "Relations" were of three kinds: Intimate and personal accounts sent to the father-general, to a relative, to a friend, or a superior, which were not meant for publication at the time, if ever. There were also annual letters intended only for members of the order, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies of which were sent from house to house. Extracts and analyses of these letters were compiled in a volume entitled: "Litterae annuae Societatis Jesu ad patres et fratres Ejusdem Societatis". The rule forbade the communication of these letters to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not members of the order, as is indicated by the title. The publication of the annual letters began in 1581, was interrupted from 1614 to 1649, and came to an end in 1654, though the provinces and missions continued to send such letters to the father-general. The third class of letters, or "Relations" properly so-called, were written for the public and intended for printing. Of this class were the famous "Relations de la Novelle-France" begun in 1616 by <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Father Biard</a>. The series for 1626 was written by Father Charles Lalement. Forty-one volumes constitute the series of 1632-72, thirty-nine of which bear the title "Relations" and two (1645-55 and 1658-59) "Letteres de la Novelle-France". The cessation of these publications was the indirect outcome of the controversies concerning the Chinese Rites, as <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> forbade (16 April, 1673) missionaries to publish books or writings concerning the missions without the written consent of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>.

At first they were circulated in MS. and contained home as well as foreign news; e.g. Litterae quadrimestres (5 vols.) lately printed in the Monumenta series, mentioned above. Later on, Litter&aelig; annuae, in yearly or triennial volumes (1581 to 1614) at Rome, Florence, etc., index with last vol. Second series (1650-54) at Dilligen and Prague. The annual letters continued, and still continue in MS., but very irregularly. The tendency was to leave home letters in MS. for the future historian, and to publish the more interesting reports from abroad. Hence many early issues of Avvisi and Litter&aelig;, etc., from India, China, Japan, and later on the celebrated Relations of the French Canadian missions (Paris, 1634-). From these ever-growing printed and manuscript sources were drawn up the collections--Lettres edifiantes et curieuses &eacute;crites par quelques missionaries del la comp. de Jesu (Paris, 1702; frequently reprinted with different matter in 4 to 34 volumes. The original title was Lettres de quelques missionaries); Der Neue-Weltbott mit allerhand Nachtrichten deren Missionar. Soc. Jesu, ed. Stocklein and others (36 vols.
