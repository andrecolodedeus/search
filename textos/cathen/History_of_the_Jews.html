<h1>History of the Jews</h1>  

<p>(<em>Yeh&uacute;d'm; Ioudaismos</em>).

<p>Of the two terms, <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> and <em><a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a></em>, the former denotes usually the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> or descendants of Jacob (Israel) in contrast to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> races; the latter, the creed and worship of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in contrast to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, etc. In a separate article we will treat of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> as a religious communion with its special system of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rites, customs, etc. (See <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">JUDAISM</a>.) Here, we shall cover the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> since the return from the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">Babylonian Exile</a>, from which time the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> received the name of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (for their earlier history, see <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">ISRAELITES</a>).

<p>This history may be divided into various periods in accordance with the leading phases which may be distinguished in the existence of the Jewish race since the Return in 538 B.C.
<h2 id="section1">Persian suzerainty (538-333 B.C.)</h2>

<p>In October, 538 B.C., Babylon opened its gates to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> army, and a few weeks later the great conqueror of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, Cyrus, made his triumphal entry into the fallen city. One of the official acts of the new ruler in Babylon was to give to the exiled <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> full liberty to return to Juda (see <a href="../bible/ezr001.htm">Ezra 1</a>). The substance of Cyrus's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in their favour is in striking harmony with other known decrees of that monarch, with his general policy of clemency and toleration towards the conquered races of his empire, and with his natural desire to have on the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> border a commonwealth as large as possible, bound to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> by the strongest ties of gratitude. A comparatively large number of Jewish exiles (50,000 according to <a href="../bible/ezr002.htm#vrs64">Ezra 2:64-65</a>) availed themselves of Cyrus's permission. Their official leader was Zorobabel, a descendant of the royal family of Juda, whom the Persian monarch had invested with the governorship of the sub-province of Juda, and entrusted with the precious vessels which had belonged to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> House. There appeared also by his side the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> "Josue, the son of Josedec", probably as the religious head of the returning community. The returned exiles, who mostly belonged to the tribes of Benjamin and Juda, settled chiefly in the neighborhood of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. They at once organized a council of twelve elders, and this council, which was naturally presided over by Zorobabel, controlled and guided the internal affairs of the community, under the suzerainty of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Without delay, too, they set up a new altar, and had it ready to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a> in 537 B.C. Henceforth, the ritual system was religiously carried out. The foundation of the second Temple was laid in the second month of the second year after the Return, but no further headway was made for fifteen or sixteen years, owing to the active interference and positive misrepresentations to the Persian kings by the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had denied a share in the work of rebuilding the House of the Lord. Meantime, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves lost much of their interest in the reconstruction of the Temple; and it is only in 520 B.C. that the Prophets <a href="../cathen/01209d.htm">Agg&aelig;us</a> and Zacharias succeeded in rousing them from their supineness. Pecuniary help came too from the Jewish community in Babylon, and also, a little later, from the Persian king. Thus encouraged, they made rapid progress and on 3 March, 515 B.C., the new Temple was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> dedicated. The Jewish leaders next started on the rebuilding of the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and here again met with the hostility of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, whose complaints at the Court of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> were most successful under Artaxerxes I "Longimanus" (464-124 B.C.), who issued orders strictly forbidding the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to proceed with the work.

<p>The special mission of Esdras and Nehemias in behalf of the struggling Palestinian community and their strenuous efforts to lift up its moral tone need not to be dwelt upon here (see <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">ESDRAS</a>; NEHEMIAS). Suffice it to say that, to whatever precise time their labours should be assigned (see <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">CAPTIVITIES</a>), the scribe Esdras and the satrap Nehemias left their permanent impress on their fellow-Jews. After Esdras's death, which probably occurred not long before the end of the Persian rule over in Juda in 333 B.C., little is distinctly known of the history of the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. It seems, however, that under the satraps of Coele-Syria, the action of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> had a very considerable influence upon their religious and civil matters alike (cfr. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Antiq. Of the Jews", XI, vii), and that their community enjoyed a steadily increasing prosperity, hardly marred by the deportation of a certain number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to distant regions like Hyrcania, which probably occurred under Artaxerxes III (358-337 B.C.). During the Persian period, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had preferred to stay in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> remained constantly in touch with the returned exiles, sending them, at times, material help, and formed a flourishing community deeply attached to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to the traditions of their race. Within the same period falls the formation of the Jewish colony at Elephantine (Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>), which was for a while supplied with a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of its own, and the faithfulness of which to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> is witness by Judeo-Aramean papyri recently discovered. Lastly, the institutions of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> which seem to have more particularly developed during the Persian domination are the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogues</a>, with their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and religious features, and the Scribes with their peculiar skill in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.


<h2 id="section2">Greek period (333-168 B.C.)</h2>

<p>A new period in the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> opens with the defeat of Darius III (335-330 B.C.) by Alexander the Great at <a href="../cathen/08201b.htm">Issus</a>, in Cilicia. This victory of the young conqueror of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> undoubtedly brought the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> into direct contact with Greek civilization, whatever may be thought of the exact historical value of what <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> relates (Antiq. of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, XI, viii, 3-5) concerning Alexander's personal visit to Jerusalem. Alexander allowed them the free enjoyment of their religious and civil liberties, and rewarded those of them who went to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with him against <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and settled in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, a city of his foundation, by granting them equal civic <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> with the Macedonians. Again, when the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> rebelled against him, he added a part of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> to <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> (331 B.C.). After Alexander's untimely death (323 B.C.), Palestine had an ample share of the troubles which arose out of the partition of his vast empire among his captains. Placed between <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, it became the bone of contention between their respective rulers. At first, as a part of Coele-Syria, it passed naturally into the possession of Laomedon of Mytiline. But as early as 320 B.C., it was seized by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Ptolemy I (323-285 B.C.) who, on a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath-day</a> took <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and carried away many <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> A few years later (315 B.C.), it fell into the power of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; but after the battle of <a href="../cathen/08098a.htm">Ipsus</a> in Phrygia (301 B.C.), it was annexed to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and remained so practically a whole century(301-202 B.C.). Seleucus I, who founded Antioch about 300 B.C., attracted the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to his new capital by granting them equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> with his Greek subjects; and thence they gradually extended into the principal cities of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The rule of the first three Ptolemies was even more popular with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> than that of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucids</a>. Ptolemy I (Soter) settled many of them in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Cyrene, whence they gradually spread over the whole country, and attained to eminence in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, art, and even literature, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the numerous Judeo-Greek fragments which have survived. Under Ptolemy II (Philadelphus), the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> was first rendered into Greek; and this, in turn, led in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to the complete translation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> known as the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. His successor, Euergetes (247-222 B.C.), is particularly credited, after a successful campaign in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, with having offered rich presents at the Temple in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Again, the annual tribute demanded by the early Ptolemies was apparently light; and as long as it was paid regularly, the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were left free to manage their own affairs under their <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priests</a> at whose side stood the Gerusia of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, as a council of state, including the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> aristocracy. In this wise, things went well under the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priesthood</a> of Simon the Just (310-291 B.C.), and that of his two brothers, Eleazar II (291-276 B.C.) and Manasses (276-250 B.C.).

<p>Matters <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> less satisfactory under Onias II (250-226 B.C.), who withheld the tribute for several years from his <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> suzerain. Under Onias's son and successor, Simon II (226-298 B.C.), whose godly rule is highly praised in Ecclesiasticus (chap. iv), the condition of Palestine became precarious owing to the renewed conflicts between <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> for the possession of Coele-Syria and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. In the end, however, the Syrian king, Antiochus II, remained master of Palestine and did his utmost to secure the loyalty of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> not only of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, but also of Mesopotamia and Babylon. Seleucus IV (187-175 B.C.) pursued at first the conciliatory policy of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and the Judean <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> prospered during the opening years of Onias III (198-175). Soon, however, intestine strife disturbed the pontiff's wise rule, and Seleucus, misled by Simon, the governor of the Temple, sent his treasurer, Heliodorus, to seize the Temple funds. The failure of Heliodorus's mission led eventually to Onias's <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and deposition from the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priesthood</a>. This deposition purchased from the new king, Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), by Jason, an unworthy brother of Onias, was the real triumph of Hellenism in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The man who, in turn, supplanted Jason was Menelaus, another hellenizing leader, whom craft and gold maintained in office, despite the complaints of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to the Syrian monarch. At length, a popular revolt occurred against Menelaus, which Antiochus put down with great barbarity, and which resulted in his leaving Menelaus in charge of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priesthood</a>, while two foreign officers became Governors of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Samaria respectively (170).
<h2 id="section3">The Machabean age (168-63 B.C.)</h2>

<p>The whole period which has just been described, was marked by the steady growth and widespread influence of hellenistic culture. Towards its end, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">Jewish high-priests</a> themselves not only assumed Greek names and adopted Greek manners, but became the ardent champions of Hellenism. In fact, Antiochus IV thought that the time had now come to unify the various races of his dominions by thoroughly hellenizing them. His general edict for that purpose met probably with unexpected opposition on the part of most Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Hence, by special letters he ordered the utter destruction of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> worship in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and in all towns of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>: under the penalty of death everything distinctly Jewish was prohibited, and Greek <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> prescribed (168 B.C.). The Holy City had recently been dismantled, and a part of it (Acra) transformed into a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> citadel. Now its Temple was dedicated to Zeus, to whom <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered upon an idol-altar erected over <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> altar. In like manner, in all the townships of Juda altars were set up and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered. In the dire <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which ensued, all resistance seemed impossible. In the little town of Modin, however, an aged <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Mattathias, boldly raised the standard of revolt. At his death (167 B.C.), he appointed his son <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, surnamed Machabeus, to head the forces which had gradually gathered around him. Under <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas's</a> able leadership, the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> troops won several victories, and in December, 165 B.C., <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was re-entered, the Temple cleansed, and Divine worship renewed.

<p>The struggle was a hard one against the numerous armies of Antiochus V and Demetrius I, the next Syrian kings; yet it was heroically maintained, with varying success, by <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> until his death on the battlefield (161 B.C.). One of his brothers, Jonathan, became his successor in command for the next eighteen years (161-143 B.C.). The new leader was not only able to re-enter and fortify <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but was also recognized as <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest of the Jews</a> by the Syrian Crown, and as an ally by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a>. It was not given him, however to restore his country to complete independence: he was treacherously captured and soon afterwards <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Syrian general, Tryphon. Another brother of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, Simon (143-135 B.C.), then assumed the leadership, and under him the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> attained to a high degree of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and prosperity. He repaired the fortresses of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, took and destroyed the citadel of Acra (142 B.C.), and renewed the treaties with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Laced&aelig;mon. In 141 B.C., he was proclaimed by a national assembly "prince and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> for ever, till there should arise a faithful <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>". He exercised the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> and may be considered as the founder of the Asmonean, or last Jewish, dynasty. The rule of John Hyrcanus I, Simon's successor, lasted 30 years. His career was marked by a series of conquests, notably by the reduction of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and the forcible conversion of Idumea. He sided with the aristocratic <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> against the more rigid defenders of the Theocracy, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, the successors of the <a href="../cathen/01800b.htm">Assideans</a>. The oldest parts of the <a href="../cathen/13770a.htm">"Sibylline Oracles"</a> and of the "Book of Enoch" are probably remainders of the literature of his day. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Aristobulus I (Heb. name, Judas), who was the first <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> ruler to assume the title of king. He reigned but one year, conquered and proselytized a part of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. His brother Alexander Jann&aelig;us (Heb. name Jonathan) occupied the throne twenty-six years (104-78 B.C.). During the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which broke out between him and his subjects he was long unsuccessful; but he finally got the better of his opponents, and wreaked frightful vengeance upon them. He also succeeded at a later date in conquering and Judaizing the whole country east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.

<p>On acceding to the kingdom, his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Alexandra (Heb. name, Salome) practically surrendered the rule to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. But this did not secure the peace of the realm, for Alexandra's death alone prevented her being involved in a new civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The strife which soon arose after her death (69 B.C.), between her two sons Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, who were favoured by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> respectively, was skilfully kept up by Antipater, the ambitious Governor of Idumea and father of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a>. It gradually led both brothers to submit to the arbitration of Pompey, then commanding the Roman forces in the East. The wary imperator finally decided in favour of Hyrcanus, marched on <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and stormed the temple, whereupon a carnage ensued. This brought to an end the short era of independence which the Machabees had secured for the country (63 B.C.). It was during the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> Age that occurred the building of a Jewish temple at <a href="../cathen/09181a.htm">Leontopolis</a> in the Delta, and the transformation of the Jewish Gerusia into the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Jerusalem Sanhedrin</a>.

<p>The fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 63 B.C. marks the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea's</a> vassalage to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pompey, its conqueror, dismantled the Holy City, recognized Hyrcanus II as <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> and ethnarch, but withdrew from his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> all territory outside of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> proper, and strictly forbade him all further conquests. Then he proceeded homewards carrying with him numerous captives, who greatly increased, if indeed they did not begin, the Jewish community in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Soon <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> became a prey to several discords, in the midst of which the weak Hyrcanus lost more and more of his authority, and his virtual master, the Idumean Antipater, grew proportionately in favour with the suzerains of the land. Upon the final defeat of Pompey at <a href="../cathen/11790a.htm">Pharsalus</a> (48 B.C.) by Julius C&aelig;sar, Antipater promptly sided with the victor, and rendered him signal services in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. His reward was the full recognition of Hyrcanus as <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> and ethnarch; and for himself the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Roman citizenship and the office of <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> over the whole of Palestine. He next proceeded to rebuild the walls of the Holy City, and to appoint two of his sons, Phasael and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, Governors of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> respectively. From this time forth <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> fortune grew rapidly, until in the Roman capital, whither he had fled from the wrath of the Nationalist party, he reached the goal of his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. The Idumean <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> ascended the Throne of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and his long reign (37-4 B.C.) forms in several respects a glorious epoch in the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">HEROD THE GREAT</a>). Upon the whole, however, it was disastrous for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Palestine. Its first part (37-25 B.C.) was chiefly spent in getting rid of the surviving Asmoneans. By their death he, indeed, made the throne more secure for himself, but also alienated the mass of his subjects who were deeply attached to the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean family</a>. To this grievance he gradually added others no less <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> to the national party. The people <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him as a bloody tyrant bent on destroying the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> still more the Romans who maintained him on the throne, and whose suzerainty was to be thrown off at the first opportunity. It was a short time before the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was born, and the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a> were massacred.

<p><a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death was the signal for an insurrection which spread gradually and was finally put down by Varus, the Governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Next followed the practical ratification of the last will of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> by <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. The principal heir was Archelaus, who was appointed ethnarch of Idumean, <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and Samaria, with the promise of the royal title on condition that he should rule to the emperor's satisfaction. For his misrule, <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> deposed him (A.D. 6), and put in his stead a Roman <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. Henceforward, <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> continued as a part of the province of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, except for a brief interval (A.D. 41-44), during which <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa I</a> held sway over all the dominions of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a>. The Roman procurators of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> resided in C&aelig;saria, and went to Jerusalem only on special occasions. They were subalterns of the Syrian governors, commanded the military, maintained peace and took care of the revenue. They generally abstained from meddling with the religious affairs, especially for fear of arousing the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Zealots of the time, who regarded as unlawful the payment of tribute to C&aelig;sar. The local government was largely left in the hands of the Sadducean <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> aristocracy, and the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> was the supreme court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, deprived, however (about A.D. 30), of the power of carrying a sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. It was under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> (A.D. 26-36), one of the procurators appointed by <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was crucified.

<p>Up to the reign of Caligula (37-44), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enjoyed, without any serious interruption, the universal toleration which Roman policy permitted to the religion of the subject states. But when that emperor ordered that Divine honours should be paid to him, they generally refused to submit. Petronius, the Roman Governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, received peremptory orders to use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to set up Caligula's <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in the Temple at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. At Alexandria a fearful massacre took place, and it looked as if all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Palestine were doomed to perish. Petronius, however, delayed the execution of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, and in fact, escaped punishment only through the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Caligula in A.D. 41. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were saved, and with the accession of Claudius, who owed the imperial dignity chiefly to the efforts of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa</a>, a brighter day dawned for them. Through gratitude, Claudius conferred upon <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a> the whole kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a>, and upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at home and abroad valuable privileges. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa's</a> careful government made itself felt throughout the entire community, and the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, now under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel I</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> teacher, had more authority than ever before. Yet the national party remained in an almost constant state of mutiny, while the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a>. Upon <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa's</a> death (A.D. 44), the country was again subjected to Roman procurators, and this was the prelude to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the Jewish people. Nearly all the seven procurators who ruled <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> from A.D. 44 to 66 acted as though they sought to drive its population to despair and revolt. Gradually, the confusion became so great and so general as manifestly to presage the dissolution of the commonwealth. At length, in A.D. 66, in spite of the precautionary efforts of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#V">Agrippa II</a>, the party of the Zealots burst into an open rebellion, which was terminated (A.D. 70) by the capture of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Titus, the destruction of the Temple, and the massacre and the banishment of hundreds of thousands of the unhappy people, who were scattered among their brethren in all parts of the world. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, forewarned by their <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a>, escaped the horrors of the last siege, by removing in due time to <a href="../cathen/11608c.htm">Pella</a>, east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. Prominent among the Jewish writers of the first century of our era are Philo, who pleaded the Jewish cause at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before Caligula, and <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who acted as Jewish Governor of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> during the final revolt against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and described its vicissitudes and horrors in a thrilling, and probably also in an exaggerated, manner.
<h2 id="section5">Last days of pagan Rome (A.D. 70-320)</h2>

<p>Rome exulted over fallen <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and struck <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> commemorative of the hard won victory. The chief leaders of the defence, a long train of heavily chained captives, the vessels of the Temple, the <a href="../cathen/13741b.htm">seven-branched candlestick</a>, the golden table, and a roll of the Law, graced Titus's triumph in the imperial city. And yet three strong fortresses in Palestine still held out against the Romans: Herodium, Mach&aelig;rus, and Masada. The first two fell in A.D. 71, and the third, the following year, which thus witnessed the complete conquest of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. For a while longer, certain fugitive Judean Zealots strove to foment a rebellion in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and in <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrenaica</a>. But their efforts soon came to naught, and <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> availed himself of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> commotion to close for ever the temple of Onias in Heliopolis. At this juncture, it looked as though the distinct groups of Jewish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> were henceforth destined to drift separately, finally to be absorbed by the various nations in the midst of which they chanced to live. This danger was, however, averted by the rapid concentration of the surviving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in two great communities, mostly independent of each other, and corresponding to the two great divisions of the world at the time. The first naturally comprised all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who lived this side of the Euphrates. Not long after the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and its subsequent misfortunes, they gradually acknowledged the authority of a new <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, which, in whatever way it arose, was actually constituted at Jamnia (Jabne), under the presidency of Rabbi Jochanan ben Zaccai. Together with the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> [now the supreme Court (B&ecirc;th Din) of the Western communities], there was at Jamnia a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in which Jochanan inculcated the oral Law (specifically the Halacha) handed down by the fathers, and delivered expository lectures (Hagada) on the other Hebrew Scriptures distinct from the written Law (<a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>). Jochanan's successor as the head of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> (A.D. 80) was Rabbi Gamaliel II, who took the title of Nasi ("prince": among the Romans, "patriarch"). He also lived at Jamnia, and presided over its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, on the model of which other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were gradually formed in the neighbourhood. He finally transmitted (A.D. 118) to his successors, the "patriarchs of the West", a religious authority to which obedience and reverence were henceforth paid, even after the seat of this authority was shifted first to Sephoris, and finally to <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>.

<p>The supremacy of "Rabbinism", thus firmly established among the Western <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, prevailed likewise in the other great community which comprised all the Jewish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> east of the Euphrates. The chief of this <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> community assumed the title of Resh-Galutha (prince of the Captivity), and was a powerful feudatory of the Parthian Empire. He was the supreme judge of the minor communities, both in civil and in criminal matters, and exercised in many other ways a wellnigh absolute authority over them. The principal districts under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> were those of Nares, <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a>, Pumbeditha, Nahardea, Nahar-Paked, and Machuzza, whose rabbinical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were destined to enjoy the greatest fame and influence. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the West possessed much less temporal authority than the princes of the Captivity; and this was only natural in view of the suspicious watchfulness which <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> and Titus exercised over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the Empire. A garrison of 800 men occupied the ruins of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to prevent its reconstruction by the religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of its former inhabitants, and in order to do away with all possible pretenders to the Jewish Throne or to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> dignity as strict search was made for all who claimed descent from the royal House of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> (A.D. 81-96), the Fiscus Judaicus, or tax of two drachmas established by <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, was exacted from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with the utmost rigour, and they were involved in the persecutions which this tyrant carried on against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The reign of Nerva (A.D. 96-98) gave a brief interval of peace to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but in that of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> (98-117), while the Roman legions had been withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> to fight against Parthia, the Jewish population of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Cyrene took up arms against the Greeks of those districts, and on both sides dreadful atrocities were committed. Thence the flame spread to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> massacred, we are told, 240,000 of their fellow-citizens. Hadrian sent forces to suppress the uprising in that island, and forbade any <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> to set his foot on its soil. Next, the revolt in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Cyrene was put down. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Mesopotamia, dissatisfied with the Romans who had just conquered the Parthians, endeavoured to get rid of the Fiscus Judaicus now imposed upon them. Their insurrection was soon suppressed by Lucius Quintus, who was then appointed to the government of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, where it is probable that disturbances were feared.

<p>The next year (A.D. 117), Hadrian became emperor. This was a fortunate occurrence for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, for as the new C&aelig;sar gave up <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> conquests beyond the Euphrates, they came again under the milder rule of their ancient sovereigns. But it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> most unfortunate for the Jewish population of the Roman world. Hadrian issued an edict forbidding <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, the reading of the Law, and the observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. He next made known his intention to establish a Roman colony in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and to erect a fane to Jupiter on the site of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh's</a> fallen Temple. At this juncture, it was announced that the Messia had just appeared. His name, Bar-Cochba, "Son of the Star", seemed to fulfil the ancient prophecy: "a star shall rise out of Jacob" (<a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs17">Numbers 24:17</a>). Rabbi Aqiba, the most learned and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrists</a> of the day, distinctly acknowledged the claims of the new Messia. Jewish warriors of all countries flocked around Bar-Cochba, and he maintained his cause against Hadrian for two years. But Roman tactics and discipline gradually prevailed. The Jewish strongholds fell one after another before Julius Severus, the Roman general; <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was taken; and at length (A.D. 135), the fortress of Bither, the last refuge of the rebels, was captured and razed to the ground. Bar-Cochba had been slain; and sometime later, Rabbi Aqiba was seized and executed, but his seven leading pupils fortunately escaped to Nisibis and Nahardea. Dreadful massacres followed the suppression of the revolt; of the fugitives who escaped death many fled to <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, whence that country obtained its Jewish population; and the rest were sold into slavery. To annihilate for ever all hopes of the restoration of a Jewish kingdom, a new city was founded on the site of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and peopled by a colony of foreigners. The city received the name of &AElig;lia Capitolina, and no <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> was allowed to reside in it or even approach its environs. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, now fully distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, were permitted to establish themselves within the walls, and &AElig;lia became the seat of a flourishing <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>.

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a> (138-161), Hadrian's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were repealed, and the active <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came to an end. Aqiba's disciples then returned to Palestine and reorganized the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> at Usha, in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (140), under the presidency of Simon II, the son of Gamaliel II. Simon's <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was not free from the petty oppression of the Roman officials, which the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> particularly felt and resented. On the occasion, therefore, of the warlike preparations of the Parthians against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a fresh revolt broke out in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> during the last year of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus's</a> reign. It was speedily suppressed under the next emperor, <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> (161-180), and followed by a re-enactment of Hadrian's extreme measures which, however, were soon annulled or never carried out. In 165, Rabbi Juda I succeeded Simon II as president of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> and patriarch of the West. The most important of his acts is the completion of the Mishna oral Law (about 189), which, concurrently with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, became the principal source of rabbinical study, and a kind of constitution which even now holds together the scattered members of the Jewish race. As Rabbi Juda was in office for over thirty years, he was the last Jewish patriarch who had to complain of the vexations of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rulers of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a> (211-217), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of citizenship; and under his successors the various disabilities by which they had been affected were gradually removed. Even such rabid <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (249-251), <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> (253-260), and <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (284-305) left the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> unmolested. During this period of peace, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the West frequently sent their <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the various <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> to ascertain their actual condition and collect the tax from which Juda III and his successors drew their income. In <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, the Jewish communities and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were flourishing under the princes of the Captivity, and except for a short space of time immediately after the conquest of the Parthians by the neo-Persians, and during the ephemeral rule of Odenathus at <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, they enjoyed quiet and independence. The condition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a> and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, at this time, is not known with any degree of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.
<h2 id="section6">Christian emperors and barbarian kings (320-628)</h2>

<p>The accession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the throne of the C&aelig;sars by the conversion of Constantine, opens a new era in the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The equality of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> emperors had admitted them was gradually restricted by the head of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> State. Under Constantine (306-337), the restrictions were few in number, and due to his interest in the welfare of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects and in the promotion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. He made the passage from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> a penal offence; prohibited the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcising</a> their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves; protected converts from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> against the fiery vengeance of their former coreligionists; but never deprived them of their citizenship, and never went beyond constraining them &#151; with the exception of their rabbis &#151; to take upon themselves certain public offices which had become particularly burdensome. These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were re-enacted and made more severe by his son Constans I (337-350), who attached the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> to marriages between <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The severity of these and other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Constans was but too fully justified by the dreadful excesses of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and by their temporary revolt in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. The accession of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, in 361, made a new diversion in their favour. This emperor decreed the rebuilding of the Temple on Mt. Moria and the full restoration of Jewish worship, apparently with a view to secure the influence of the Mesopotamian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in his expedition against the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were triumphant, but their triumph was short-lived; sudden flames burst forth from Mr. Moria and rendered impossible the rebuilding of the Temple; <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> perished in his Persian War, and his successor, Jovian (363-364), reverted to Constans' policy. The next emperors, <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> and Valentinian, reinstated the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their former <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, except, however, the exemption from the public services. Under Gratian, <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>, and Arcadius, they likewise enjoyed the protection of the Throne; but under Theodosius II (402-450), emboldened by their long immunity from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, they manifested a spirit of intolerance and crime which let to violent tumults between them and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in various parts of the Eastern Roman Empire, and apparently also to the prohibition of building new <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and from discharging any state employment. It was under Theodosius II that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of the West, then held by Gamaliel VI, came to an end (425). Some time before (c. 375), the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> Talmud was finished, a work which, however important for <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, is less complete, in regard to both its Mishna and its Gemara, than the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud, the compilation of which was terminated by the heads of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> about 499, despite the violent persecutions of the Persian kings, Jezdijird III (440-457) and Firuz (457-484). The immediate result of Firuz's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was the emigration of Jewish colonists in the south as far as Arabia, and in the east as far as <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> where they founded a little Jewish state on the coast of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> which lasted till 1520. Under Qubad I, Firuz's son and successor, the prince of the Captivity, Mar-Zutra II, managed to maintain for seven years an independent Jewish state in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>; but in 518, the Byzantine successors of Theodosius II enforced his anti-Jewish <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> with great rigour, and, as a result, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life and former <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Judean <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> became virtually extinct.

<p>In the West the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> fared decidedly better during the fifth century than in the East. They of course suffered many evils during the invasions of the northern barbarians who flooded the Western Empire after its permanent separation in 395 from the Eastern Empire of Constantinople. In the midst of the political convulsions naturally entailed by these invasions, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gradually became the masters of the commerce, which the conquerors of the Western Empire, addicted to the arts of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, had neither time nor inclination to pursue. In the various states which soon arose out of that dismembered empire, the numerous Jewish colonies do not seem for a long time to have been subjected to restrictive measures, except in connection with their slave trade. The <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> left them free to exercise their religion. They were justly treated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, by the kings of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>; in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, by the early Merovingians generally; and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> down to the conversion of King Recared to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> (589), or rather down to the accession of Sisebut (612), who, deploring the fact that Recared's anti-Jewish <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> had been little more than a dead letter, resolved at once to enforce them, and in fact added to them first the injunction that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should release the slaves in their possession, and next, that they should choose between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and banishment. Anti-Jewish legislation was framed at a much earlier date in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> dominions. Hostility towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> showed itself first in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, under King Sigismund (517), and thence it spread over the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> countries. In 554, Childebert I of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> forbade them to appear on the street at Eastertide; in 581, Chilperic compelled them to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; in 613, Clotaire II sanctioned new decrees against them; and in 629, Dagobert bade them choose between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and expulsion. Thus the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> both in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> reached gradually a degree of severity unknown even to such Eastern <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> as Justinian I (527-5650 and Heraclius (610-641). Yet, the edicts of these Byzantine emperors were vexatious enough. In fact, Justinian's decrees so exasperated the Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that despite the persecutions of their Mesopotamian fellow-Jews by the Persian kings, Jusrau I (531-579), Hormizdas IV (579-591), and Kusrau II (590-628), they seized the first opportunity to avenge themselves by siding with Kusrau II in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Heraclius. During the Persian invasion and occupation of Palestine, they committed dreadful excesses against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which finally met with a merited punishment in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which Heraclius, again master of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, started against them.
<h2 id="section7">The Mohammedan ascendancy (628-1038)</h2>

<p>The rise of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, with whose power the Arabian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cane in contact when it was yet in its infancy, marks the beginning of a new period in Jewish history. Several centuries before <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> birth (c. 570), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had effected important settlements in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, they had acquired a considerable influence upon the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> population. In fact, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that at one time, there existed in Southern Arabia (Yemen), an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a>-Jewish kingdom which was brought to an end in 530 by a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> king of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. But although they had lost their royal estate, the Arabian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were still numerous and powerful, in the Hedjaz, north of Yemen. There was indeed but a small Jewish population in <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> birthplace; yet it is probable that contact with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of that city was one of the means by which the founder of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, its <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, and it Patriarchs. This acquaintance became naturally closer after the Hegira (Flight) of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> (622) to Medina, the chief centre of the Arabian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. To win the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> to his cause, the "prophet" made various concessions to their religion and adopted some of their customs. As this was useless, and as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were a constant menace to his cause, he resolved to get rid of their tribes one after another. He first put an end to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the vicinity of Medina, and next (628) subjected those of the district of Khaibar and of Wadi al-Kura to an annual tribute of half the produce of the soil. After <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> death (A.D. 632), Caliph Abu-Bekr tolerated the Jewish remnant in Khaibar and al-Kura; but this toleration ceased under Omar, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> second successor. During Omar's short caliphate (634-644), <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> fell under the sway of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were fairly well treated by their new masters. Omar's so-called "Covenant" (640) imposed indeed restrictions upon <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the whole <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> world, but these restrictions do not seem to have been carried out during his lifetime.

<p>In return for the valuable assistance of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Omar's campaigns against <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, this caliph granted them several privileges, among which may be mentioned the recognition of their exilarch Bostana&iuml; (642). Under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam's</a> fourth caliph, Ali (656-661), the Jewish community of Irak (Babylonia) became more fully organized and assumed the appearance of an independent state, in which the Talmudic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a> and Pumbeditha flourished again. The exilarch and the head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a>, with his new name of Gaon (658), were of equal rank. The former's office was political, the latter's distinctly religious. The exilarch, both in bearing and in mode of life, was a prince. Thus it came to pass that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> scattered through the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> world persuaded themselves that in Abraham's own country there survived a prince of the Captivity who had regained the sceptre of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. For them, the heads of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were the representatives of the ideal times of the Talmud. The farther the dominion of the Ommiads (661-750) was extended, the more adherents were gained for the Jewish <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> chiefs. The great liberty which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enjoyed under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam's</a> rule allowed them to cultivate Paitanism or neo-Hebraic poetry and to begin their <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> labours (see <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massora</a>).

<p>Meantime, their fellow-Jews were less fortunate in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where most rulers of the seventh century enacted severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. Towards the end of that century, Egica forbade them to own lands and houses, to repair to or trade with North Africa, and even to transact business with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Having next discovered a plot of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> rule, he sentenced to slavery all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of his states and ordered that their children of seven years and upwards be given to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. This condition of things came to an end under Roderic, Egica's second successor and last <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. With numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their army, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> crossed from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> into <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, defeated and slew Roderic (July, 711); <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was gradually conquered; and in 720, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> occupied Septimania, north of the Pyrenees, a dependency of the Gothic Kingdom. In <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to whose help the conquerors largely owed their victories, obtained their liberty. In fact, it was now given to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at large to enjoy a long period of nearly unbroken peace and security. Apart from the persecutions started in 720 by the Caliph of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, Omar II, and in 723 by the Byzantine emperor, Leo III, they prospered everywhere till about the middle of the ninth century. It was during this period that the great Kingdom of the Chazars, which was situated west of the Caspian Sea, and had caused the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> to tremble, embraced <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> (c. 745); its rulers remained exclusively Jewish above two centuries and a half. After the caliphs of the Ommiad dynasty, one of whom had a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> as his mint-master, those of the Abassides, till after Harun al-Rashid (d. 809), do not seem to have seriously disturbed their Jewish subjects; during that time, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmudic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were crowded with hearers, and had it not been for their internal dissension, religious (Karaites) and political (contests for the dignity of exilarch), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Babylon would have been as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as they were renowned for their learning. In <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (with its separate Caliphate of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> since A.D. 756), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were undoubtedly prosperous during the century now under review, although details concerning their condition during that time are actually wanting. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Jewish population was not submitted to any serious restrictions under either Pepin (752-768) or <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (764-814), while under Louis I (814-840) it even enjoyed special favours and privileges, the king having for his confidential adviser his Jewish physician name Zedekiah, and actively protecting Jewish interests against powerful opponents.

<p>Thus, with the exception of a passing <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under the two sons of Harun al-Rashid, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were left unmolested for about 100 years. But with the middle of the ninth century, and nearly everywhere, this ceases to be the case. In the East, Jewish persecutions were resumed by the Byzantine emperors of the Macedonian dynasty (842-1056), and by the Abasside Caliph al-Motawakel, who, in 853, re-enacted the Covenant of Omar, and under whose successors in the Caliphate of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, the Jewish community of Irak lost more and more of its prestige and was supplanted in this respect by that of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>: the exilarchate gradually ceased to be an office of the State and finally perished (c. 940), owing chiefly to the dissensions between the Gaons of <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a> and Pumbeditha; and the Gaonate itself, for a while made famous by Saadiah, ultimately disappeared through the oppression of the weak caliphate (c. 1038). Under the Fatimite dynasty of caliphs (909-1171), whose rule extended over North Africa, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were worse off still. About the middle of the tenth century, the Jewish Kingdom of the Chazars was destroyed by the Russians. In the West, the lot of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was also that of a despised and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> race. Charles the Bald (840-877) protected them effectively, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but his weak <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> successors and the early Capetians lacked sufficient authority for doing so. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, as early as 855, Louis II ordered the banishment of all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and his order failed to have the intended effect only because of the distracted condition of the realm at the time. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where "Jew" was synonymous with "merchant", the emperors were long satisfied with exacting a special tax from their Jewish subjects; but finally Henry II (1002-1024) expelled from <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who refused to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and it is probable that his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was applied to other communities.

<p>Spain (Navarre, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, and Leon) also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, although towards the end of the tenth century, its rulers placed them in many respects on an equality with the rest of the population. In <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, however, the Jewish race was politically and religiously free. Under such patrons of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and art as the Ommiad caliphs, Abd-er-Rhamman III (d. 961), Al-Hakem (d. 976), and the regent Al-Mansur (d. 1002), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> greatly increased in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and became famous for learning as well as for commercial and industrial activity. The Talmudic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, Lucena, and <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> took the place of those of <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a> and Pumbeditha, under the high patronage of the Jewish statesmen Hasdai, Jacob Ibn-Jau, and Samuel Halevi. During this period, an Arabic translation of the Mishna was made in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by Ibn-Abitur, and the first commentaries on the Talmud were composed at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> by Gershom ben Juda (d. 1028).
<h2 id="section8">Era of the Crusades (1023-1300)</h2>

<p>In many respects, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> owed a great deal to its Jewish population; yet, in 1066, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were expelled from the <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Kingdom of Granada</a>. In many ways, too, the young kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were indebted to their Jewish inhabitants; nevertheless, Ferdinand the Great subjected them to vexatious measures and was only prevented from drawing the sword against them by the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. These, however, were but passing storms; for Alfonso VI (1071-1109) soon freely used <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in his diplomatic and military operations, while in the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> states distinct from <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, Jewish culture reached the zenith of its splendour. The era of Jewish persecutions really began with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> (1096-1099). The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> enacted in May-July, 1096, bloody scenes against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Worms, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and other Rhenish towns, and repeated them as they went along in the cities on the Main and the Danube, even as far as <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes being mostly on the side of the victims, but proving, for various reasons, powerless to protect them effectively. On the capture of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 15 July, 1099, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> wreaked a frightful vengeance on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the fallen city.

<p>The interval between the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> was a time of respite and recuperation for the Jewish race. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and even in Palestine, they were left unmolested; while in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, they attained to a high degree of prosperity and influence, and actively pursued literary and Talmudic studies under the guidance of Juda Halevi and the sons of Rashi. Yet, in 1146, on the eve of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>, there began against them the violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Almohades in Northern Africa and Southern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> which brought about the speedy ruin of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and would have resulted in the practical annihilation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had not most of them found a refuge in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> dominions of Alfonso VIII (d. 1157). Then came the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> (1147-1149) with its atrocities against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Worms, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, and Strasburg, despite the protestations of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and of Eugenius III, and the efforts of the German <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and the Emperor Conrad III in their behalf; and with its most deplorable result, namely the greater enslavement of the German <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to the Crown. The next fifty years were, on the whole, for the Jewish race a period of peace and prosperity; in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where Juda Ibn-Ezra was steward of the palace to Alfonso VIII; in Mesopotamia, where Mohammed Almuktafi revived the dignity of exilarch; in the Two Sicilies, where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> with the rest of the population; in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a> was favourable to them, and the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a> (1179) passed decrees protecting their religious liberty; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and its French provinces, where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were very flourishing under Henry Plantagenet (c. 1189); in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> itself, where under the kind rule of Louis VI and Louis VII (1108-1180) they greatly prospered in every direction. And yet, in some of these countries there was a deep-seated <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Jewish race and its religion. It manifested itself in 1171 when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> were burned on the charge of having used <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> blood in their <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, and it allowed <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> in the year of his accession (1180) to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> the confiscation of all the unmovable goods of his Jewish subjects and their banishment from his domains.

<p>This feeling showed itself particularly on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a> (1189-1192). The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were massacred on the day of the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard I</a> (3 Sept, 1189) and soon afterwards in several English towns (1190). About the same time, <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> them at different places from the district of the Rhine to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. When again in 1198 a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> (1202-1204) was preached, many barons of northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> got released from their <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> to Jewish creditors, and then drove them out of their dominions. <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> received indeed the exiles in his own territory, but he was chiefly actuated by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> appealed to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to curb the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>; and in answer, the pontiff issued a Constitution which rigorously forbade mob <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and forced <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but which apparently had little or no effect.

<p>The year 1204, in which closed the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a>, marked the beginning of still heavier misfortunes for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. That very year witnessed the death of <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>, the greatest Jewish authority of the twelfth century, and the first of the many efforts of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to prevent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes from showing favour to their Jewish subjects. Soon afterwards, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> suffered grievously during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> which ended only in 1228. In 1210, those of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were ill-treated by King John Lackland and their wealth confiscated to the Exchequer. Next, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Toledo were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> (1212). The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> legislation of the time was generally unfavourable to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and it culminated in the anti-Jewish measures of the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), among which may be mentioned the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from all public offices, and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that they should wear a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> badge. Besides being thus legislated against, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were divided amongst themselves with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the writings of <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>. Gradually, the Lateran decrees against them were enforced wherever this was possible, and active persecutions from kings and <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were started, the rulers of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> being particularly conspicuous for their extortions of money from their Jewish subjects.

<p>In many places, the severity of the Lateran decrees was outdone, so that in 1235 <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> felt called upon to confirm the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and in 1247 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> reprobating the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusations and various excesses of the time against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Writing to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the latter pontiff says: <blockquote> Certain of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have falsely devised certain godless plans against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> depriving them by force of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and appropriating it themselves; . . . they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> the heart of a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> boy. . . . In their malice, they ascribe every <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, wherever it chance to occur, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. . . . They oppress the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by starvation, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and by tortures and sufferings; they afflict them with all kinds of punishments, and sometimes even condemn them to death, so the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, although living under <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, are in a worse plight than were their ancestors in the land of the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaohs</a>. They are driven to leave in despair the land in which their fathers have dwelt since the memory of man. . . . Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed, . . . we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations. </blockquote>

<p>The protestations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> do not seem to have been much heeded in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> states generally. In 1254, nearly all the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were banished by St. Louis from the king's domains. Between 1257 and 1266, Alfonso X of Castile compiled a code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which contained several clauses against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and countenanced the blood accusation which had been contradicted by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>. During the last years of Henry III (d. 1272), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> fared worse and worse. About this time, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> ordaining that no injury be inflicted upon their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (1273); but the popular <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against them on the charge of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, use of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> blood at their <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, etc., could not be restrained; and the thirteenth century which had witnessed their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in all parts of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, except <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, closed with their total expulsion from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1200, under Edward I, and their carnage in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1283 and 1298. During the same period, public disputations had been resorted to but with little success for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Further light on the severity of measures enacted by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> or councils concerning the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as well on the motives of popular prejudice and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, will be found below, under section <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">JUDAISM</a>: (4) <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and Church Legislation.
<h2 id="section9">Last part of the Middle Ages (1300-1500)</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century, Jewish rabbis were divided concerning the value of the Zohar, the sacred book of the Kabalists (see <a href="../cathen/08590a.htm">KABBALA</a>), which Moses of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> had recently published. A still deeper division prevailed among them with regard to the cultivation of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> philosophy and the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and literature, and it resulted in 1305 in a public ban on the part of several Jewish leaders against the study of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The next year (1306), <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> plundered and expelled all the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, some of whom travelled as far as Palestine to enjoy there freedom under the rule of the mameluke sultan, Nassir Mohammed (d. 1341), while most remained on the border of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, thinking that the royal <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> which had caused their banishment would bring about their early return. Meantime, their coreligionists of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> narrowly escaped the carrying out of stringent measures against their own <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges (1313). The banished <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were actually recalled in 1315 by Louis X, and admitted for twelve years. But as early as 1320, there arose against them the bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of some 40,000 <em>pastoureaux</em> who pretended to be on their way to the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1321, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were accused by the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> of having poisoned the wells and rivers, whereupon a new <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ensued. The same year, owing to intrigues against them, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, then very flourishing in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and literature, would have been expelled from Roman territory by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> who resided in <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, had it not been for the timely intervention of Robert of Anjou, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. In Castile, where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> possessed great influence with Alfonso XI (1312-1350), the various plans against them actually failed, and the king showed himself favourable to them till the day of his death. Their enemies were more successful in Navarre on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of independence which this province waged against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were apparently in the way of the secession, they were subjected to a violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> during the course of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1328), and to oppressive measures after Navarre had become a separate kingdom.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, they fared still worse during the riots and the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> under Louis IV (1314-1347). For two consecutive years (1336, 1337), the Armleder, or peasants wearing a piece of leather wound around arm, inflicted untold sufferings upon the Jewish inhabitants of Alsace and the Rhineland as far as Swabia. In 1337, also, on the charge of having profaned a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> were subjected to a slaughter which soon extended to those of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, although <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> had issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> promising an inquiry into the matter. Besides, Louis IV, who always treated his Jewish subjects as mere slaves, subjected them (c. 1342) to a new and most onerous poll-tax. Greater Jewish massacres occurred in 1348-1349 while the fearful scourge, known as the "Black Death", desolated <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The report that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had caused the scourge by poisoning the wells used by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, spread rapidly and was believed in most towns of Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, despite the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> in July and September, 1348, declaring their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a>. Despite the fact, too, that the same pontiff had solemnly ordered that <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> be not forced into <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that their <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, festivals, <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and cemeteries be respected, that no new exactions be imposed on them, they were plundered and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in many countries of Central and Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The next years were, on the whole, a period of respite from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for the Jewish race. In Castile, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> attained to a great influence under Don Pedro (1360-1369), and the misfortunes which then befell them arose partly from the prevalent view that they availed themselves of their power to lap up the people's possessions with their tax-farming, and partly from their constant loyalty to Don Pedro's cause, during the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which broke out between him and Don Henry. The latter, after reaching the throne, showed himself friendly to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and agree only reluctantly to some of the restrictive measures urged by the Cortes in 1371. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, they were readmitted as early as 1355 into the very towns which had sworn that for 100 or 200 years no <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> should dwell within their walls.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, they were granted special privileges by King John (1361), which they enjoyed to the full extent under his successor, Charles V (1364-1380). But the last twenty years of the fourteenth century were again disastrous for the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, scarcely was Charles V dead, when popular riots were started against them because of their extortionate <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> and encouragement to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to recant, and finally brought about the permanent exile of the Jewish population (1394). In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the reign of John I (d. 1390) witnessed a great curtailing of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> power and privileges; and that of Henry III (d. 1406) was marked by bloody assaults in many cities of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile and Aragon</a> and even in the island of Majorca, on account of which numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1384), and in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1389, 1399), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were likewise <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> had protested, but in vain, against such outrages and slaughters (1389); and it is only in his states, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, that the Jewish race had any measure of peace during these years of carnage.

<p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enjoyed some manner of respite in nearly all the countries where they had been allowed to stay or whither they had fled from persecuting <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But these peaceful days did not last long. As early as 1408, there appeared in the name of the infant King of Castile, John II, an edict which revived the dormant anti-Jewish <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Alfonso X; and soon afterwards (1412), a severer edict was issued, intended to isolate the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> lest intercourse should injure the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, and calculated to induce them to give up their religion. In fact, degraded in every way, parked in "Juderias", and deprived of practically every means of subsistence, many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> surrendered to the exhortations of St. Vincent Ferrer, and received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while the others persevered in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and saw their misery somewhat alleviated by the royal edict of 1414. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> gradually extended to all the provinces of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where St. Vincent also effected many conversions. At length, brighter days dawned for the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> upon the death of Ferdinand, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (1416) and of Catherine, Regent of Castile (1419), and upon the publication of the following solemn declaration of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1419), in their behalf: "Whereas the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are made to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a remnant of them will one day be saved, and whereas they have besought our protection: following in the footsteps of our predecessors we command that they be not molested in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>; that their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and customs be not assailed; that they be not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, constrained to observe <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Christian festivals</a>, nor to wear any new badges, and they be not hindered in their business relations with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>." But then began new persecutions against the Jewish population of Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In their distress, the Austrian and the German <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> appealed to the same pontiff who, in 1420, also raised his voice in their favour, and who, in 1422, confirmed the ancient privileges of their race. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Cologne were expelled in 1426, and those of several towns of southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> burned on the old blood accusation (1431). To add to their misfortune, the Council of Basle renewed the old and devised new restrictive measures against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (1434); the unfavourable Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Albert, became Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1437-1439); and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> (1431-1447), at first well-disposed towards them, showed himself by this time less friendly to them.

<p>Meantime, the Jewish communities of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> prospered under John II, who promoted several <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to public offices, and who in 1432 confirmed the statute of the Jewish Synod of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> prescribing the establishment of separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, however, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> complained to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the arrogance of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and, in consequence, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> issued an unfavourable <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (1442) which greatly reduced Jewish prosperity and influence in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and which was practically repeated in 1451 by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> (1447-1455). This pontiff was distinctly opposed to mob <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and he enjoined upon the Inquisitors of the Faith not only to refrain from exciting the popular <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against them, but even to see that they should not be forcibly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or otherwise molested. And yet, under <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, severe persecutions befell the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and their fugitives found a friendly refuge almost exclusively in the new <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire started by Mohammed II, the conqueror of Constantinople in 1453. The German emperor, Frederick III, was weak and vacillating, so that practically down to the end of his reign (1493), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> remaining in Central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were repeatedly subjected to miseries and humiliations. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> fared better during the same period, owing to the fact that the flourishing republics of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> appreciated and needed them as capitalists and diplomatists; and it is worthy of notice that the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were very prompt in availing themselves of the newly invented art of typography. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, also, the Jewish population lived in comparative peace and comfort under Henry IV of Castile (1454-1474) and John II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (1458-1479), for, apart from a few popular riots directed against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> then prevailing in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> fell upon the "Maranos", or forcibly converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for whose <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> or weakness <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was but a mask. Even after Ferdinand II and Isabella had united Castile and Leon under one sceptre (1479), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> remained undisturbed &#151; except in <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a> &#151; until the fall of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, protected as they were by Isaac Abrabanel, the ruler's Jewish minister of finance. But the conquest of the rich Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> apparently led Ferdinand and Isabella to regard the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as no longer indispensable, as in fact out of place in their estates, which they wished altogether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Without the approval of <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> appeared (1492) banishing all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and it was carried out despite Abrabanel's supplication and offer of an immense sum of money.

<p>Great indeed were the misfortunes which befell the impoverished Jewish exiles. In Navarre, they had ultimately to choose between expulsion and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. In the African seaports, when allowed to land, they were decimated by plague and starvation. On the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> ships, they were submitted to the most brutal treatment, and those who landed near <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> reduced to starve or give up <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, their fellow-Jews offered 1000 ducats to <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> to prevent their admission, an offer which was indignantly refused. In <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, they were compassionately received by Ferdinand I, but also carried off in numbers by the pestilence which broke out among them. In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, John II tolerated them only eight months, after which all remaining were made slaves. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that John's successor, Emmanuel (1495-1521), at first freed those enslaved <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but he finally signed in December, 1496, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> expelling from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who would refuse to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and in 1497 had it carried out. The country where the Spanish refugees were most hospitably received was Turkey, then ruled over by Bajazet II.
<h2 id="section10">Modern period (1500-1700)</h2>

<p>These expulsions of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gave rise in the sixteenth century to the important division of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> into "Sephardim" (Spanish and Portuguese <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>) and "Askenazim" (German and Polish <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), thus called from two Biblical words connected by <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> rabbis with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> respectively. Wherever they settled, the Sephardim preserved their peculiar ritual and also their native refinement of dictions, manners, dress, etc., which stood in striking contrast with those of the Askenazim and secured for them an influence which the latter did not exercise despite their closer acquaintance with the Talmud and greater faithfulness to ancestral virtues and traditions. Thus were formed two deep currents of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> requiring to be treated separately during the modern period of Jewish history. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Sephardim found a refuge chiefly in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, where they were soon rejoined by numerous Maranos of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> who again professed <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, they enjoyed the high protection of Samuel Abrabanel, a wealthy <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> who apparently administered the finances of the viceroy, Don Pedro of Toledo. In <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Florence, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Maranos were well treated by the respective rulers of these cities; and even in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which considered the expediency of their expulsion lest their presence should injure the interest of native merchants, they were simply confined to the first Italian Ghetto (1516). The early <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> of the sixteenth century had Jewish physicians and were favourable to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the Maranos of their states. Time soon came, however, when the Sephardic <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> fared differently. As early as 1532, the accusation of child <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> nearly entailed the extermination of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1555, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> revived the ancient canons against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which forbade them the practice of medicine, the pursuit of high commerce, and the ownership of real estate. He also consigned them to a Ghetto, and compelled them to wear a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> badge. In 1569, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> expelled all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, except <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (1585-1590) recalled them; but, soon after him, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1592-1605) banished them again partially, at the very moment when the Maranos of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> lost their last place of refuge in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Similar misfortunes befell the Jewish race in other states of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as the Spanish domination extended there: <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> banished the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in 1541; <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, in 1550; <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, in 1597. Henceforward, most Sephardic fugitives simply passed through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> when on their way to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire.

<p>During the whole present period, Turkey was, in fact, a haven of rest for the Sephardim. Bajazet II (d. 1512) and his immediate successors fully realized the services which the Jewish exiles could render to the new <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> empire of Constantinople, and hence welcomed them in their states. Under Selim II (1566-1574), the Marano Joseph Nassi, become Duke of Naxos and the virtual ruler of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, used his immense power and wealth for the benefit of his coreligionists, at home and abroad. After Nassi's death, his influence passed partially to Aschkenazi, and also to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewess</a> Esther Kiera who played a most important role under the Sultans Amurath III, Mohammed III, and Achmet I. During the remainder of the period, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Turkey were generally prosperous under the guidance of their rabbis. Their communities were spread throughout the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>, their most important centres being Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Turkey, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Safed in Palestine. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the period were repeatedly disturbed by the appearance of such <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiases</a> as David Rubeni, Solomon Molcho, Lurya Levi, and Sabbatai Zevi; but the public authorities of Turkey took no steps to punish the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who shared in such <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> agitations. The country in which, next to Turkey, the Sephardim fared best, was <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. The origin of their settlements in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> is chiefly due to the immigration of Portuguese Maranos who, under Emmanuel's successors, were repeatedly subjected to the terrors of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> despite the laudable efforts of several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in their behalf, and who, after the conquest of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> by <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, in 1580, reached <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, now in full revolt against the Spanish domination. Their first congregations of 1593 and 1598 in Amsterdam were acceptable to the city authorities who saw in the new-comers a means of extending <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> commerce, and who, in 1619, allowed the public exercise of Jewish worship under liberal conditions. During the seventeenth century, the Amsterdam <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> contributed actively to the home and foreign prosperity of their adopted country. They greatly increased in numbers by new accessions of Portuguese Maranos, and established communities in <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07062a.htm">Guiana</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. It was also in Amsterdam that the movement originated for a legal re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from which <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had been strictly excluded since 1290. Oliver Cromwell, protector of the realm (1653-1658), was personally in favour of the movement, and he actively seconded the skilful pleadings of Manasses ben Israel, the leading rabbi of <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, for that purpose. Cromwell, however, did not dare openly to bring about a change generally <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> to the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and nation. Under Charles II (d. 1685), the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> stole insensibly into the kingdom, where they have ever since maintained their footing. The chief difficulties of the Sephardim in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> were of an internal order: their rabbis used rather freely the power of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, one of the victims of which was the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> (1656); and the majority of the Jewish population of <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> was more or less seriously disturbed, about this time, by the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> pretensions of Sabbatai Zevi.

<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Askenazim or German <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were less fortunate than their Sephardic contemporaries. Their general condition remained much the same as during the preceding period. It is often, but wrongly, asserted that the invention of printing, the revival of learning, and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> were beneficial to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. When, early in the sixteenth, century, the German <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> began to use the printing press for their own literature, sacred or otherwise, the Emperor Maximilian (d. 1519) was urged to order all Hebrew books to be burned, and but for the strenuous exertions of Reuchlin, the burning of the Talmud would have taken place. "That the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> itself had nothing to do with the subsequent ameliorations in the conditions of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, is plain from the fact that in many parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, their lot became actually harder than before" ("The New Inter. Cyclop.", vol. X, New York, 1903). <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself, towards the end of his life, was their greatest opponent. <blockquote> He poisoned the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> world for a long time to come, with his <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>-hating testament. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> became even more bitter against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had been. The leaders of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> demanded absolute submission to canonical law; but on that condition granted them permission to remain in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, on the other hand, required their absolute expulsion. . . . It was reserved for him to place <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on a level with Gypsies. . . . He was the cause of their being expelled by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes. (Gr&auml;tz) </blockquote>

<p>In general, the emperors of the period acted with equity towards their Jewish subjects. At times, however, they expelled them from their crown lands, or connived at their banishment from other places. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, Ferdinand II (d. 1638) treated the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with great consideration, and required his generals to spare them from the hardships of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Under him and under his son, the Jewish community of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> was particularly flourishing; but this prosperity ended abruptly under Leopold I (1657-1705), and although about 1685 some <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> succeeded in stealing into <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Leopold's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of exclusion was formally repealed only much later. The chief place of refuge for the Askenazim of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> was at this time the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, where the Jewish population was remarkably free and prosperous up to the middle of the seventeenth century. In 1648, the Polish <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> began themselves to be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the Cossacks of the Ukraine who invaded <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and were victorious in three successive campaigns. They were next subjected to the disastrous invasions of the Russians and the Swedes. It is estimated that within ten years (1648-1658), more than 200,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were slaughtered in the Polish dominions. In consequence, the surviving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> were reduced to a condition of extreme poverty and abjection from which the Polish kings of the second part of the seventeenth century earnestly strove to extricate them. During the period just sketched, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scholars began to cultivate Hebrew under the guidance of Jewish grammarians; Hebrew studies were introduced into German and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>; and Richard Simon made the learned world acquainted with rabbinical literature.
<h2 id="section11">Recent times (since 1700)</h2>

<p>In dealing with this last period, it will be convenient to narrate briefly the events relative, first to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the Old world, and next to those of the New. The internal condition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the Old World during the first half of the eighteenth century was that of a general demoralization which made them appear all the more disreputable because the recent works of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scholars, such for instance, as the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by Basnage, had forcibly directed the attention of the learned world towards them. They were not indeed subjected to the wholesale massacres of former days, but they remained in the eyes of all a despised race liable to all kinds of disabilities. In Sweden, they were allowed (1718) to enter the kingdom under unfavourable conditions; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, new restrictions were imposed on their settlements (1718) at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>; in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Frederick William I (1714, 1730) breathed a spirit of great intolerance against them; at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the concessions made to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by Charles III, in 1740, were soon revoked; in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, charges that they were in league with the country's enemies during the War of the Austrian Succession were readily believed, led to bloody riots against them, wellnigh entailed (1745) under <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> their perpetual expulsion from <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia, and caused the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Prague to be placed under the most severe restrictions; in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Catherine I (1727) took active measures against the Ukraine <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and banished the Jewish population from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Anna Ivanowa (1739) decreed their expulsion from Little <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and Elizabeth (1741-1762) harshly enforced anti-Jewish measures; and finally, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were simply tolerated as aliens, and a naturalization act, which was passed by both Houses and ratified by George II (1753), was actually repealed (1754) owing to the nation's opposition to it.

<p>Gradually, however, a number of circumstances lessened this spirit of hostility against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Among these circumstances may be particularly mentioned: (a) the vast influence exercised by Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), who, by his literary attainments and his strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the world that his race could produce men worthy of admittance into the highest <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and showed to his fellow-Jews the way to remove prejudices against them; and (b) the vigorous defence of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writer Dohm, who, in his work "Upon the Amelioration of the Condition of the Jews", suggested many practical measures which <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> partly accepted in 1781, when he abolished the Jewish poll-tax and granted civil liberties to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Under these, and other such circumstances, a more liberal spirit toward the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> prevailed in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where William II and Louis XVI, respectively, abolished the Jewish body tax. It made itself felt also in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> where Catherine II (1762-1796) even decreed the civil and religious liberty of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but under whose rule the Russian Senate managed to organize the "Pale of Settlement" or portion of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in which <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are allowed to reside, and to enforce other anti-Jewish measure. It culminated in the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> which actually opened the era of Jewish emancipation: in 1790, the French National Assembly granted citizenship to the Sephardic <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and, in 1791, it extended full civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the country. With French victories and influence, Jewish liberty naturally followed, and, in 1796, the <a href="../cathen/02346b.htm">Batavian</a> National Assembly decreed citizenship for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> summoned in 1806 an assembly of Jewish notables which succeeded in calming his prejudices against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and in 1807 a <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Great Sanhedrin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to his satisfaction that the Jewish race may be faithful both to its religion and to the State. Then followed, not without difficulties, yet in rapid succession, the emancipation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> (1808), of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (1811), of Mecklenburg, and of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1812).

<p>The fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and the consequent period of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> reorganization gave a setback to Jewish liberty, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, which was for a while the scene of bloody riots against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but gradually, and nearly everywhere in the Old World, Jewish liberty prevailed. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Jewish rabbis were put, under Louis Philippe (1831), on the same footing with regard to salary as the <em>cur&ecirc;s</em> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; in 1846, the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> "More Judaico" was abolished as unconstitutional; and since the wave of anti-Semitism which culminated in the well-known case of Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish population of the country and of <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> has not been molested. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, it was not before 1858 that Parliament was freely opened to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the suppression of the clause "On the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>" from the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of office, and not before 1870, that all restrictions for every position (except that of sovereign) in the British Empire were abolished. In northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the various states allowed civil liberty to their Jewish population in 1848, and after 1870, all restrictions disappeared, although since that time, owing to anti-Semitism, minor disabilities have been publicly enacted or quietly enforced in some parts of the Empire. <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> enfranchised the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in 1849, whereas Sweden and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> still subject them to certain disabilities. In 1867, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> were emancipated, and in 1895, those of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> obtained, moreover, that <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> be considered as "a legally recognized religion". In <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, after a long and bitter struggle, the Federal Constitution of 1874 granted to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> full liberty. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Jewish disabilities, revived on the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, and the application of which occasioned in 1858 the celebrated Mortara Case, have all been gradually abolished, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the last Italian place where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were emancipated, elected a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, Ernesto Nathan, for its mayor, 10 October, 1908. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> have not yet recognized officially their small Jewish population. The Danubian provinces of <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, and Montenegro, have, in accordance with the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, allowed civil and religious liberty to their Jewish settlers, whereas the province of Rumania, in defiance of the same treaty, has refused it and carried out persecutions which have entailed a very large emigration of <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were granted citizenship in 1839; yet, in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire, there repeatedly occur accusations of ritual and child-murder, which inflame the populace and lead to anti-Jewish riots.

<p>In Palestine, their number is rapidly increasing (there are now 78,000) despite the sultan's restrictions (1888, 1895) concerning the accession of Jewish immigrants in numbers; and agricultural colonies are established in various parts of the land. In Fez and chiefly in <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have still much to fear from the fanaticism of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. In <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, they are at times oppressed, despite the ruler's general goodwill towards them. Their fate has been, and still is, deplorable in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> where lives nearly one-half of the total Jewish population of the globe. The liberty of trade and commerce granted to them by Alexander I (1801-1825) was replaced, under <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> (1825-1855), by a legislation calculated to diminish their number, to deprive them of their religious and national character, and to render them morally and commercially harmless to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> (1855-1881)was very favourable to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but the reaction against them under <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1881-1894) was of the most intolerant kind. From the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the Ignatieff law of 1882, the most restrictive measures have been piled up against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and since 1891 they have been applied with such severity that Russian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> in hundreds of thousands, mostly to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Under the present emperor, <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, new restrictions have been devised; riots against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> occurred in 1896, 1897, 1899, and culminated in the massacres of Kishineff, Homel, etc., from 1903 to 1906, helped in various ways by Russian officials and soldiers; during the year 1909, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> took the form of orders of expulsion, and the trials prescribed by the Duma against the organizers and perpetrators of the massacres of some years ago are apparently a farce.

<p><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> settled in South America, exiled from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, or taking part in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and English commercial enterprises in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> was their main centre. Those found there in the sixteenth century were Maranos who had been sent in company with convicts. They acquired wealth and became very numerous at the beginning of the seventeenth century. They helped the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> in wresting <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1624), and were joined in 1642 by many Portuguese <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>. At the end of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> rule over <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (1654), most Jewish settlers returned to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; some <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to French settlements &#151; Guadaloupe, <a href="../cathen/09731a.htm">Martinique</a>, and Cayenne; others took refuge in <a href="../cathen/04569e.htm">Cura&ccedil;ao</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> possession; and finally, a small band reached <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a> (New York). After a very few years, those who had settled on the French islands were compelled to turn to friendly <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> possessions, and to other places of refuge, notably to Surinam (then belonging to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>) where they became increasingly prosperous. The other early settlements of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Mexico, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and the West Indies do not require more than a passing mention. Of much greater importance were those effected chiefly by Sephardim in North America. There were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a> as early as 1652; others came from <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> in 1654. As these were not received in a friendly manner by the governor, Peter Stuyvesant, some of them betook themselves to the Colony of Rhode Island, where they were reinforced in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> by contingents from <a href="../cathen/04569e.htm">Cura&ccedil;ao</a> (1690) and from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> (1755). The condition of those who had remained at <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a> was, on the whole, fair, for they were sustained by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> home Government; and it remained substantially so after 1664, at which date the British captured <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a> and changed its name to New York. At the end of the seventeenth century there were some <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The next places of settlement were <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> (with a large percentage of Askenazim), <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and the Carolinas.

<p>During the War of the American Revolution, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> generally took the colonial side; some fought <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> for it; and Haydn Solomon aided the Continental Congress with his money. Following the Declaration of Independence (July, 1776) most of the states of the Union placed all citizens upon an equality, the only notable exception <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, in which state all disabilities were removed only in 1826. During the nineteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> spread over all the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and recently into their possessions, after the Spanish American War (1898), in which some 2000 Jewish soldiers took part. Important congregations have also grown up in the larger cities of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> possess full civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> since 1831. From 1830 to 1870, the immigration into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> came largely from the Rhine Provinces, South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Since 1882, the riots and persecutions in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> have let to an immense emigration, a small portion of which was directed by Baron von Hirsch to the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine Republic</a>, or went to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, but the great bulk of which came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. To these have been added numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from Galicia and Rumania. The total Jewish immigration to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> through the three chief ports of entry (New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) from 1882 to 30 June 1909, was 1,397,423, out of which upwards of 54,000 reached the country between 1 July, 1908, and 30 June, 1909. In consequence, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> have the third largest Jewish population in the world, the latest estimates being 5,215,805 for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, 2,084,591 for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, and 1,777,185 for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. For the immigrants who, for the most part, have settled in large business centres, day and night <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to teach them English, together with trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to enable them to earn a livelihood, have been organized or enlarged. For those whom it has been possible to divert elsewhere, agricultural colonies have been attempted in several states, but have been little successful. In nearly every other line (<a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, philanthropic, literary, financial, etc.) the development of Jewish activity during the last twenty-five years has been both rapid and successful. Differently from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Jamaica and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> those of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are altogether independent of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of any <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> authority.
