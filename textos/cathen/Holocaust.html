<h1>Holocaust</h1>  

<p>As suggested by its Greek origin (<em>holos</em> "whole", and <em>kaustos</em> "burnt") the word designates an offering entirely consumed by fire, in use among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> nations of antiquity. As employed in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, it corresponds to two Hebrew terms: (1) to <em>holah</em>, literally: "that which goes up", either to the altar to be sacrificed, or to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in the sacrificial flame; (2) <em>Kalil</em>, literally: "entire", "perfect", which, as a sacrificial term, is usually a descriptive synonym of <em>holah</em>, and denotes an offering consumed wholly on the altar. At whatever time and by whomsoever offered, holocausts were naturally regarded as the highest, because the most complete, outward expression of man's reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is, indeed, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that certain passages of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> have been construed by modern critics into an utter rejection of the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, the holocausts included; but this position is the outcome of a partial view of the evidence, of the misconception of an attack on abuses as an attack on the institution which they had infected. For details concerning this point, and for a discussion of the place which the same scholars assign to the <em>holah</em> (holocaust) in their theory of the development of the sacrificial system among the Hebrews, see <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">SACRIFICE</a>. The following is a concise statement of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> as contained chiefly in what critics commonly call the Priests' Code, concerning whole burnt-offerings.
<h2>Victims for holocausts</h2>

<p>Only animals could be offered in holocaust; for human victims, which were sacrificed by the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a> and by other peoples, were positively excluded from the legitimate worship of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/lev018.htm#vrs21">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../bible/lev020.htm#vrs2">20:2-5</a>; <a href="../bible/deu012.htm#vrs31">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>; etc.). In general, the victims had to be taken either from the herd (young bullocks) or from the flock (sheep or goats); and, to be acceptable, the animal was required to be a male, as the more valuable, and without blemish, as only then worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm#vrs2">Leviticus 1:2, 3, 5, 10</a>; <a href="../bible/lev022.htm#vrs17">22:17 sqq.</a>). In certain cases, however, birds (only turtle-doves or young pigeons) were offered in holocaust (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm#vrs14">Leviticus 1:14</a>; etc.); these birds were usually allowed to the poor as a substitute for the larger and more expensive animals (<a href="../bible/lev005.htm#vrs7">Leviticus 5:7</a>; <a href="../bible/lev012.htm#vrs8">12:8</a>; <a href="../bible/lev014.htm#vrs22">14:22</a>), and were even directly prescribed in some cases of ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="../bible/lev015.htm#vrs14">Leviticus 15:14, 15, 29, 30</a>). Game and fishes, which were sacrificed in some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worships of Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, were not objects of sacrifice in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>.
<h2>Ritual of holocausts</h2>

<p>The principle rites to be carried out in the offering of holocausts, were (1) on the part of the offerer, that he should bring the animal to the door of the tabernacle, <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">impose his hands</a> on its head, slay it to the north of the altar, flay and cut up its carcass, and wash its entrails and legs; (2) on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, that he should receive the blood of the victim, sprinkle it about the altar, and burn the offering. In the case of an offering of birds, it was the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who killed the victims and flung aside as unsuitable their crop and feathers (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm">Leviticus 1</a>). In public <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, it was also the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to slay the victims, being assisted on occasions by the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>. The inspection of the entrails, which played a most important part in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of several ancient people, notably of the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a>, had no place in the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> ritual.
<h2>Classes of holocausts</h2>

<p>Among the Hebrews, holocausts were of two general kinds, according as their offering was prescribed by the Law or the result of private <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> or devotion. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> holocausts were (1) the <em>daily</em> burnt-offering of a lamb; this holocaust was made twice a day (at the third and ninth hour), and accompanied by a cereal oblation and a libation of wine (<a href="../bible/exo029.htm#vrs38">Exodus 29:38-42</a>; <a href="../bible/num028.htm#vrs3">Numbers 28:3-8</a>); (2) the <em>sabbath</em> burnt-offering, which included the double amount of all the elements of the ordinary daily holocaust (<a href="../bible/num028.htm#vrs9">Numbers 28:9, 10</a>); (3) the festal burnt-offering, celebrated at the New Moon, the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, on the Feast of Trumpets, the day of Atonement, and the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a>, on which occasions the number of the victims and the quantity of the other offerings were considerably increased; (4) the holocausts prescribed for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<a href="../bible/exo029.htm#vrs15">Exodus 29:15 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/lev008.htm#vrs18">Leviticus 8:18</a>; <a href="../bible/lev009.htm#vrs12">9:12</a>), at the purification of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (<a href="../bible/lev012.htm#vrs6">Leviticus 12:6-8</a>), at the cleansing of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> (<a href="../bible/lev014.htm#vrs19">Leviticus 14:19, 20</a>), at the purgation of ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="../bible/lev015.htm#vrs15">Leviticus 15:15, 30</a>), and finally in connection with the <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> (<a href="../bible/num006.htm#vrs11">Numbers 6:11, 16</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> burnt-offerings the number of the victims was left to the liberality or to the wealth of the offerer (cf. <a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#vrs4">1 Kings 3:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#vrs21">1 Chronicles 29:21</a>, etc., for very large <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> holocausts), and the victims might be supplied by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, a permission of which <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> actually availed himself, according to Philo (Legatio ad Caium, xl).
<h2>Chief purposes of holocausts</h2>

<p>The following are the principal purposes of the whole burnt-offerings prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>: (1) By the total surrender and destruction of victims valuable, pure, innocent, and most nearly connected with man, holocausts vividly recalled to the Hebrews of old the supreme dominion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over His creatures, and suggested to them the sentiments of inner purity and entire self-surrender to the Divine Majesty, without which even those most excellent <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> could not be of any account before the Almighty Beholder of the secrets of the heart. (2) In offering holocausts with the proper dispositions worshippers could feel assured of acceptance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who then looked upon the victims as a means of atonement for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>), as a well-pleasing sacrifice on their behalf (<a href="../bible/lev001.htm#vrs3">Leviticus 1:3, 9</a>), and as a cleansing from whatever defilement might have prevented them from appearing worthily before Him (<a href="../bible/lev014.htm#vrs20">Leviticus 14:20</a>). (3) The holocausts of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> foreshadowed the great and perfect sacrifice which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> of the New Law and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb of God, was to offer in fulfillment of all the bloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the first covenant (<a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs12">Hebrews 9:12, sqq.</a>; etc.).
