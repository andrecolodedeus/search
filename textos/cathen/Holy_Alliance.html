<h1>Holy Alliance</h1>  

<p>The Emperor Francis I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, King Frederick William III of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and the Tsar Alexander I of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, signed a treaty on 26 September, 1815, by which they united in a "Holy Alliance." Although a political act, the treaty in its wording is a statement purely religious in character. Having in mind the great events of the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and in gratitude to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> shown to their people, the three monarchs declared their fixed resolution to take as the only rule of their future administration, both in internal and foreign affairs, the principles of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace. They declared that, far from being of value only in individual life, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality is also the best guide in public life. Accordingly the rulers declared their fraternal feeling towards one another, in virtue of which they would not only give support to, but abstain from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with, one another, and would guide their subjects and their armies in a fatherly manner. They declared that they would administer to guide three great branches of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian family of nations</a>; the rightful Lord of the nations, however, remains the One to whom belongs all power, our Divine Saviour, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. They also recommended their subjects with the most tender solicitude to strengthen themselves daily in the principles and practice of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> which the Saviour taught, because this was the only way to attain the enduring enjoyment of that peace which arises from a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and which is lasting. In conclusion they called upon all the Powers to become members of the alliance. In point of fact, Louis XVIII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> joined it on 19 November and even the Prince Regent of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> did likewise.

<p>The world had long learned not to expect from statesmen official documents in which so religious a tone prevailed. When the wording of the agreement became known early in 1816, men saw in the alliance the consequence of the closest union of politics and religion. To a certain extent the world suspected that it veiled a league of the rulers and the churches, especially of the rulers and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, against the nations and their freedom. For, besides the success of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and the sudden revulsion, nothing occupies and surprised public opinion so much as the universal revival of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought, and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Men watched with suspicion this unexpected turn of affairs which was contrary to all the prejudices developed by the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> of the eighteenth centry. It was also considered possible that the conquerors of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had in the Holy Alliance bound themselves to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which was regaining its old power, in order by its aid to oppose, for the benefit of royal and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> absolutism, the "liberal" development of States and civilization. The judgment of public opinion, which is always superficial, held a few external signs as evidence of the facts which it suspected behind the alliance. Among these indications taken as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were, perhaps, the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> by the Powers, or the casual and confused information that the public gradually inferred from the mighty <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">Joseph de Maistre</a>, or from the more circumscribed views of Bonald, <a href="../cathen/07119a.htm">Haller</a>, and others. In reality, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; that is to say, its head, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> councillors, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; regarded with coldness this alliance, which took under its wings <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> alike, while <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> &#151; that is, the total of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and masses taking part in the public life of the nations and states &#151; was even averse or hostile to the alliance. Individual exceptions, in the opinion of the present writer, do not amount to a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the contrary.

<p>In this case, as so often in the history of the world, words of seemingly great significance excited notions the more extravagant, the less substance and influence the matter indicated by the statement possessed. The testimony of <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Prince Metternich</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> most familiar with the subject and the one who, next to the tsar, had the most to do with the founding of the alliance, is: <blockquote> The Holy Alliance, even in the prejudiced eyes of its originator (the tsar), had no other aim than that of a moral manifesto, while in the eyes of the other signers of the document it lacked even this value, and consquently justified none of the interpretations which in the end party spirit gave to it. The most unanswerable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the correctness of this fact is probably the circumstance, that in all the following period, no mention was made or even could have been made of the Holy Alliance in the correspondence of the cabinet with one another. The Holy Alliance was not an institution for the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the nations, for the promotion of absolutism, or for any kind of tyranny. It was solely an emanation of the pietistic feelings of the Emperor Alexander, and the application of the principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to politics. </blockquote>

<p>This quotation gives the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> statement in regard to the facts of the case, as well as in regard to the personal factor in the founding of the alliance, which was the transitory pietistic feeling of the tsar at that time. The vigorous reawakening of the religious sense had called forth, especially in connection with the revival of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thinking, many confused and obscure manifestations of a mystical and spiritualistic kind that were reactionary in tendency. From June, 1815, the tsar had come under the sway of one of these mystical and reactionary tendencies, through the influence of the Baroness von Krudener, a lady of German-Russian descent who was a religious visionary. Without striving to exert political power, she seems, nevertheless, to have imbued Alexander with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that princes must once more rule according to the dictates of religion and under religious form. While the lady was intent wholly on arousing <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideals, Alexander at once gave a political cast to the suggestion when he endeavoured to formulate it and, with this end in view, drew up the treaty on which the Holy Alliance is based. His demand was not welcome to statesmen of practical mind like <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>, but they did not consider it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to decline the proposal. They struck out merely what was most objectionable to them, and by degrees <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> quietly replaced the entire alliance by the purely political alliance of 20 November, 1815, between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, by the Treaty of Aachen of 18 October, 1818, and the agreements made at the Congresses of Troppau (1820), <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a> (1821), and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (1822).

<p>Nevertheless the expression "Period of the Holy Alliance" for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> politics of the years 1815-23, that is, for the era when <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich's</a> influence was at its height, has some justification. A brief general review of events will prove this. But the term should not be taken too literally; moreover, it must be admitted that history, in characterizing a period, is more apt to adopt an easily-found and striking expression than an exact one. During the years 1814-15, a number of treaties were concluded between the various countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In this series of compacts the Holy Alliance forms merely one link and in a practical sense the most unimportant one; it was also the only treaty which was religious in character. All these treaties have, however, one trait in common. They revive the conception of a centralized <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the individual states seem to be limited by the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> which each state has in regard to the whole body of states. The signatories announced the end of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that had been carried on since the era of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> by those grasping powers and interests, which took only into consideration the <em>ratio status.</em> They further asserted that all just political demands were satisfied, that the great Powers were "saturated", and on the strength of this, they introduced into <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a> the conception of a common <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> responsibility, the application of which was to be secured by agreement of the great Powers as cases arose. This common responsibility was to be used for the liberal promotion of all <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and social life, but political <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">liberalism</a> was to be suppressed or held in check in order to reserve the administration of public affairs to the governments as specially <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> thereto. The renewal of the common responsibility of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states, and of the scheme of administration involved therein, may be regarded as the most characteristic work of <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a>.

<p>The desire for this joint responsibility had gradually developed from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the Austrian policy of the eighteenth century, and had been already expressed in the instructive papers of <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a> written in his old age. It was now formulated and made a reality by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> greatest statesman. Between the eras of <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a> and <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a>, however, had appeared the revival of religious feeling in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The minds of men turned once more to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Involuntarily the course of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> thought, even that of the most cool-headed statesmen, became again subordinate to the categories of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thinking. Little as <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> was personally inclined to base his political views on religion, he did not fail to observe that his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a common responsibility of the nations and his inclination to peace bore a resemblance to the loftiest <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> ideals of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian unity of nations</a> and of a common civilization. He had even an exaggerated <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of this resemblance, as had many of his contemporaries. In consequence of this over-estimation, however (for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were rooted in <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>), he allowed these views to appear, if only for a moment, in the words of the Holy Alliance as the proper "application of the principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to politics." From his non-resistance to the tsar, his contemporaries inferred that the alliance proclaimed a return to the times in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> claimed and exercised the right of guiding the <em>respublica christiana.</em> It is in this way that historical events are twisted and confused by the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, both of the individual and of the multitude. The Holy Alliance became a bugbear representing reaction, while in reality, like everything that even distantly harmonized with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, it was of advantage to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and assured to it peace for a generation, and an extraordinary development of civilization.
