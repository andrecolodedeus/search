<h1>Holy Coat</h1>  

<p>(OF TRIER AND ARGENTEUIL).

<p>The possession of the seamless garment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (Gr. <em>chiton arraphos</em>; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>tunica inconsultilis</em>, <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs23">John 19:23</a>), for which the soldiers cast lots at the Crucifixion, is claimed by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Argenteuil. The <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> tradition affirms that this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was sent to that city by the Empress St. Helena. For some time the holders of this opinion based their claim on a document in the ancient archives of the city, the "Sylvester Diploma", sent by Pope Sylvester to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, but this cannot, at least in its present form, be considered genuine. It has, however, been conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by incontestable documents, that since about the year 1100 the people of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> were fully convinced that they possessed the seamless garment of Christ and that it had come to them from St. Helena. The life of St. Agritius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, written in the eleventh century (before 1072), mentions the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> by St. Helena during the lifetime of Agritius, and relates from the "reliable tradition of the forefathers" that at one time a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> wished to have opened the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> shrine kept in the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, containing among other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> a garment of the Lord, of which some said that it was the seamless coat, and others that it was the purple garment with which He was clothed at the time of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> (Monumenta Germ. Hist., Script., VIII, 211). The "Gesta Treviorum", written in 1105, bears witness to the existence of the <em>Tunica Domini</em> and to the tradition regarding the manner of its being brought to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., VIII, 152). An ancient witness to the tradition of the sending of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> by St. Helena (no special mention, however, being made of the Holy Coat) is the panegyric of St. Helena composed by Almannus of Hautervilliers about 880 (Acta Sanctorum, Aug., Vol. III, p. 952). A still more ancient witness is an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> tablet preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> treasury of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, dating from as early as the fifth or sixth century according to some, and according to others from a later period. it is explained to be a representation of a translation of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> witht he co-operation of St. Helena. While this testimony may not furnish actual <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, it goes far to confirm the probability of the same.

<p>The arguments of the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> are merely their own opinions: these writers furnish no substantial <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their contention. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> itself offers no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> its genuiness. Archaeological investigations (1890 and 1891) have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that "the material of the plain brownish coloured fabric is to all appearances linen or cotton." It has been impossible to discover any traces of original seams on the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, which is covered on both sides by protecting veils. The investigation therefore furnished no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the ancient tradition at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. In 1196 the Holy Coat was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> transferred by Archbishop Johann I from the St. Nicholas <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> at at that time <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by him (Continuation of the "Gesta Trevirorum", Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., XXIV, 396). Here the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> seems to have remained unseen and untouched until 1512. In that year, in accordance with the wish of the Emperor Maximilian I, on the occasion of the holding of a Diet at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, it was taken from its resting-place in the altar on 14 April by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Richard von Greifenklau, and on 3 May, and for many days after, solemnly shown to the assembled princes and people. In the years following, up to 1517, an exposition of the Holy Coat took place annually. The auxiliary bishop, Johann Enen, composed a Mass "de Tunica inconutili," found in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> Missals printed at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> (1516) and at Coblenz (1547). At the solicitation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 26 January, 1515, granted a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to all <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who should visit the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> at the time of the exposition of the Holy Coat, which henceforth was to take place every seven years, and always in the same year as the Aachen <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. This order for an exposition of the Holy Coat every seven years was observed from 1517, in which year the next Aachen <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> took place, to 1545. Then the regular succession ceased, and the next expositions occurred only in the years 1585 and 1594, and then not again until 1655 after the close of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>.

<p>In the warlike times that followed, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was repeatedly taken to the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, and from there brought back again to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. When the French invaded the principality of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 1794, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was carried for safety into the interior of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to Bamberg and then to <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, whither the last Elector of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Clemens Wenceslaus, also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, had withdrawn. It was not until 1810 that, through the repeated efforts of Bishop Mannay, it was returned to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, on which occasion the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> organized a solemn exposition of the Holy Coat, from 9 to 27 September of that year, it being the first since 1655. It was very largely attended by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the surrounding country. Of still greater importance were the two following expositions, which took place in the nineteenth century. The first was organized by Bishop Arnoldi from 18 August to 6 October, 1844. Large and enthusiastic crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, over a million, it is said, flocked from all quarters to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Apart from the influence which the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of that year exercised on religion, a number of wonderful cures were accomplished. On the other hand, this exposition was the occasion of much fanaticism. On 15 October, 1844, the suspended <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Johann Ronge published his open letter to Bishop Arnoldi, the result of which was the so-called "Deutsch-katholisch" or "German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" movement. Among other hostile writings which appeared at that time, that of the Bonn professors, J. Gildermeister and H. von Sybel, purporting to stand on scientific grounds, made the most stir. An exposition rivalling that of 1844 was the last one, ordered by Bishop Korum from 20 August to 4 October, 1891. On this occasion the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> numbered 1,925,130. To encourage this exposition, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> gave his approval to the Office "de tunica inconsutili," and granted by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 11 July, 1891, an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. An account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and manifestations of Divine favour which occurred was published in 1894 by Bishop Korum himself.

<p>The Argenteuil tradition claims that the garment <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in that city as the Holy Coat was brought there by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The oldest document relating to the existence of this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> dates from 1156. This is the "Charta Hugonis", in which Archbishop Hugh of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> testifies that in the treasury of the church of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at Argenteuil is preserved the <em>Cappa pueri Jesu</em> (garment of the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>) a <em>temporibus antiquis</em> (from ancient times); that he himself, in company with other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, had examined it and found it genuine, and that VII, and afterwards publicly for the veneration of the faithful; he proclaimed at the same time an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who should come to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> it (the "Charta" is printed by Jacquemot, p. 233 sqq., also in P.L., CXCII, 1136-38). The words advocated of the tradition of Argenteuil to mean the <em>Tunica inconsutilis</em> worn by the Saviour during His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> chronicles, from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, which speak of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> and of its exposition in 1156, make it clear how this change in the tradition was effected; it was brought about by the intermingling of the details of the two legends, accounted for by the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the garment woven by the Blessed Virgin for the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> grew with Him, and was thus worn by Him during His entire life on earth. The modern advocates of the Argenteuil tradition now designate the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> there simply as the seamless garment of Christ; they deny to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to call their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> by this name, conceding however that the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> is genuine, but that it is not the <em>Tunica inconsutilis</em>, but the outer garment of Christ.

<p>Those who believe the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> tradition claim on the contrary that the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of Argenteuil, which is woven of fine wool and is of a reddish brown colour, is not a tunic but a mantle. By this they do not seek to dispute the authenticity of the Argenteuil <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, but to assert that it is the <em>Cappa pueri Jesu</em> and not the <em>Tunica inconsutilis.</em> The history of the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of Argenteuil may be traced from 1156. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> menaced its safety. After the despoiling of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> it was first transferred in 1791, from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> church to that of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. In 1793 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of that year, who feared that it would be taken away and dishonoured, cut it into pieces which he concealed in various places. In 1795 those portions that could be found were brought back to the church; of these there are four, one large piece and three smaller ones. The translation to the new church of Argenteuil took place in 1865, and the last expositions in 1894 and 1900. A mass and a Sequence in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Holy Coat of Argenteuil are to be found in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Chartres Missals printed in the sixteenth century.
