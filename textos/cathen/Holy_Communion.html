<h1>Holy Communion</h1>  

<p>By Communion is meant the actual reception of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Eucharist</a>. <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">Ascetic</a> writers speak <ul> <li>of a purely <em>sacramental</em> reception; that is, when the Eucharist is received by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> capable indeed of the fruits but wanting in some disposition so that the effects are not produced; <li>of a <em>spiritual</em> reception, that is, by a desire accompanied with sentiments of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>; and <li>of a <em>sacramental</em> and <em>spiritual</em> reception, that is, by those who are in a state of grace and have the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> dispositions. </ul>

<p>It is of this last kind there is question here. For real reception of the Blessed Eucharist it is required that the sacred species be received into the stomach. For this alone is the <em>eating</em> referred to by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs58">John 6:58</a>). Under the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> aspect will be considered, in reference to Holy Communion: <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; subject; dispositions. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> aspect will embrace: <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; method of administration.
<h2 id="section1">Moral aspect</h2>
<h3 id="A">Necessity</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is that Holy Communion is morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that is to say, without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it would be very difficult to resist grave <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and avoid grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover, there is according to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine precept</a> by which all are bound to receive communion at least some times during life. How often this precept urges outside the danger of death it is not easy to say, but many hold that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has practically determined the Divine precept by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Fourth Council of Lateran (c.xxi) confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to receive Communion once each year within <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Paschal Time</a>.
<h3 id="B">Subject</h3>

<p>The subject of Holy Communion is everyone in this life capable of the effects of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a>, that is all who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and who, if adults, have the requisite <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04170b.htm">COMMUNION OF CHILDREN</a>).
<h3 id="C">Dispositions</h3>

<p>That Holy Communion may be received not only validly, but also fruitfully, certain dispositions both of body and of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are required. For the former, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> must be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> from the previous midnight from everything in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of food or drink. The general exception to this rule is the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, and, within certain limits, <a href="../cathen/04174a.htm">communion of the sick</a>. In addition to the fast it is recommend with a view to greater worthiness, to observe <a href="../cathen/04330b.htm">bodily continence</a> and exterior modesty in dress and appearance. The principal disposition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> required is freedom from at least mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. For those in a state of grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> confession is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. This is the <em>proving</em> oneself referred to by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>). The only case in which one in grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might dispense with confession and rest in content with perfect <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, or perfect charity is when on one hand confession here and now is morally speaking impossible, and where, on the other a real <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of communication exists.
<h2 id="section2">Liturgical</h2>
<h3 id="A">Minister</h3>

<p>The ordinary <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of Holy Communion is one who has received at least <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders. <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacons</a> were often deputed for this office in the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priests</a> can now by general <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> administer Communion to everyone assisting at their Masses in public churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, permission of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is ordinarily required. Communion should be administered to all those who ask it reasonably, excluding, at least until they make sufficient <a href="../cathen/12775a.htm">reparation</a>, <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">public sinners</a> and such as lead openly <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> lives. So, too, it is not to be given to those likely to treat it with irreverence, or to the mentally deranged or those suffering from certain forms of illness.
<h3 id="B">Method of administration</h3>

<p>As to the administration, the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, place, and manner, and the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> only will be referred to here, other details, as reservation, effects, etc., being considered elsewhere. (See <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">EUCHARIST</a>.) The ordinary <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for reasonable cause justifies its administration outside Mass, provided it is within the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> within which the celebration of Mass is permitted. There are some exceptions: <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">viaticum</a> can be given at any hour; it is lawful in cases of illness and of special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a>. It may not be given except as <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, from the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">exposition</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> till <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>. Communion may be given in all churches and public, or semi-public, <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> that are not under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, and, according to a recent edict of the Congregation of Rites (8 May, 1907), even in domestic <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> at present. The faithful receive Communion under one kind, fermented <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> being used in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">unfermented</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">under both kinds</a>. Each one should receive according to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Rite</a> to which he belongs. When administering Holy Communion outside Mass a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should always wear a <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, and there should be two <a href="../cathen/09244b.htm">lights</a> burning on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>. Communion may now be given at Masses said in black <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>.
