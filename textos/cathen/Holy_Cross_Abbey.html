<h1>Holy Cross Abbey</h1>  

<p>The picturesque ruins of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> are situated on the right bank of the River Suir, about three miles south-west of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> town of Thurles, Co. Tipperary. While not one of the largest <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> houses, it was the most beautiful in point of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> details, as may be realized from the fine proportions and delicacy of treatment in the stone-carving, peculiar to the main portions of the building. This <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded in the year 1169 by Donald O'Brien, King of Thomond, and in the order of dates was the eleventh of the forty-two houses established in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> previous to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> by the disciples of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Reformed Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. As its designation indicates, the fame of the establishment was mainly due to the fact that the church was enriched with a shrine of the Holy Cross, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> being one of the most considerable in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and for over three and a half centuries the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was one of the most frequented <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> places in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The church of the Holy Cross is cruciform in plan, consisting of <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>, <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, with double side-chapels. Between two of the latter in the north <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> the pillared shrine, wherein the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was wont to be exposed for public veneration, still stands. This is a fine specimen of thirteenth-century carving and style, showing decided traces of French influence in its beautiful Gothic details. Among the more remarkable features of the monastic church are the east window, the groined roofing of the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> and side-chapels, and the ribbed vaulting beneath the tower. All the windows are of different design, and are remarkable for the beautiful flamboyant treatment they illustrate. In the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> at the Epistle side of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is a structure not less interesting than the shrine in the north <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>. While it apparently might have served the purpose of sedilia &mdash; having three divisions, composed of slender- pillared arches, surmounted with a canopy of elaborate tabernacle work &mdash; it is always styled the "tomb of the good <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> son". The frieze is further adorned with foliaged tracery through which are displayed the cross of St. George, the royal arms of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> quartered with those of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">heraldic</a> emblems of historic interest.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Rood, so long the object of the pilgrim's veneration, is said to have been bestowed on this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by one of the Plantagenet queens of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in gratitude for the kind services of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the time in having the remains of her son (who met his death in the neighbourhood of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, while on a visit to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>) <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the church. The erection of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is ascribed to her, as also is the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, which surpassed anything of the kind in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in its <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> splendour. Circumstances point to the fact that the young prince &mdash; "The good <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> son" &mdash; was no other than "Pierce the Fair", son of Isabella of <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a> (<a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of King John) by her second husband, Le Brun, Count of La Marche. He would therefore have been half-brother of Henry III of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His death is recorded by the "Four Masters" as having occurred in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1233. The Abbey of Holy Cross, as one of the greater <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, was suppressed under the fiat of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1536. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the time, William O'Dwyer, surrendered on condition that he would enjoy the revenues for his lifetime. Eventually, Holy Cross with its appurtenances was conferred by Elizabeth on Thomas, Earl of Ormonde. However, we find as late as 1633 the Divine ministrations were still exercised in the church. The year 1632 was apparently the last during which the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> was exposed for public veneration. Subsequently, the community withdrew to Kilkenny city, where a private house was rented by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Right Rev. Luke Archer. Here they decided to await the coming of better times, but the hoped-for day of return to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> never came. The preservation of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> ruins is now the charge of the Board of Works (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>).
