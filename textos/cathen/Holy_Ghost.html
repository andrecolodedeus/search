<h1>Holy Ghost</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Synopsis of the dogma</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the Holy Ghost forms an integral part of her teaching on the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/130101.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> I.3.5</a>), speaking with diffidence, says: "In no other subject is the danger of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> so great, or the progress so difficult, or the fruit of a careful study so appreciable". The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> points of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> may be resumed in the following propositions:

<ul> <li>The Holy Ghost is the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity. <li>Though really distinct, as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, from the Father and the Son, He is <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> with Them; being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> like Them, He possesses with Them one and the same Divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">Essence</a> or <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>. <li>He proceeds, not by way of generation, but by way of spiration, from the Father and the Son together, as from a single principle. </ul>

<p>Such is the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> demands.
<h2 id="section2">Chief errors</h2>

<p>All the theories and all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> that have contradicted or impugned, in any way, the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Trinity, have, as a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequence, threatened likewise the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Holy Ghost. Among these, history mentions the following:

<ul> <li>In the second and third centuries, the dynamic or modalistic <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchians</a> (certain <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, it is said, Theodotus of Byzantium, <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, <a href="../cathen/12344a.htm">Praxeas</a>, No&euml;tus, Sabellius, and the Patripassians generally) held that the same Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, according to His different operations or manifestations, is in turn called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; so they recognized a purely nominal Trinity. <li>In the fourth century and later, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and their numerous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> offspring: Anomans or <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomians</a>, <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Acacians</a>, etc., while admitting the triple <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, denied the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a>. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> had been preceded by the Subordination theory of some ante-Nicene writers, who affirmed a difference and a gradation between the Divine Persons other than those that arise from their relations in point of origin. <li>In the sixteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> explicitly rejected, in the name of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, along with all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Three Persons in One God</a>. <li>Mention may also be made of the teachings of Johannes Philoponus (sixth century), <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscellinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06555a.htm">Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e</a>, <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Flora</a> (eleventh and twelfth centuries), and, in modern times, <a href="../cathen/07085a.htm">G&uuml;nther</a>, who, by denying or obscuring the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the numerical unity of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">Nature</a>, it reality set up a triple <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deity</a>. </ul> In addition to these systems and these writers, who came in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> about the Holy Ghost only indirectly and as a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> result of previous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, there were others who attacked the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> directly:

<ul> <li>Towards the middle of the fourth century, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, and, after him a number of <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, while apparently admitting the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, denied that of the Holy Ghost. They placed Him among the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a>, inferior <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but higher than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. They were, under the name of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachians</a>, condemned by the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Council of Constantinople</a>, in 381 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, III, col. 560). <li>Since the days of <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a> maintain that the Holy Ghost, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> like the Father and the Son, proceeds from the former alone. </ul>
<h2 id="section3">The Third Person of the Blessed Trinity</h2>

<p>This heading implies two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>:

<ul> <li>The Holy Ghost is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> really distinct as such from the Father and the Son; <li>He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> with the Father and the Son. </ul>

<p>The first statement is directly opposed to <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchianism</a> and to <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinianism</a>; the second to Subordinationism, to the different forms of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and to Macedonianism in particular. The same arguments drawn from <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> may be used generally to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> either assertion. We will, therefore, bring forward the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> together, but first call particular attention to some passages that demonstrate more explicitly the distinction of <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>.
<h3 id="A">Scripture</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the word <em>spirit </em>and, perhaps, even the expression <em>spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> </em>signify at times the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> himself, inasmuch as he is under the influence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and aspires to things above; more frequently, especially in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, they signify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; but they are used, besides, to designate not only a working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in general, but a Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, Who is neither the Father nor the Son, Who is named together with the Father, or the Son, or with Both, without the context allowing them to be identified. A few instances are given here. We read in <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs16">John 14:16-17</a>: "And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, that he may abide with, you for ever. The spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whom the world cannot receive"; and in <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs26">John 15:26</a>: "But when the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me." St. Peter addresses his <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs1">first epistle, 1:1-2</a>, "to the strangers dispersed . . . <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, according to the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>". The Spirit of consolation and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is also clearly distinguished in <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs7">John 16:7, 13-15</a>, from the Son, from Whom He receives all He is to teach the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and from the Father, who has nothing that the Son also does not possess. Both send Him, but He is not separated from Them, for the Father and the Son come with Him when He descends into our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs23">John 14:23</a>).


<p>Many other texts declare quite as clearly that the Holy Ghost is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> distinct from the Father and the Son, and yet <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">One God</a> with Them. In several places <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of Him as if speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In <a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs25">Acts 28:25</a>, he says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: "Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>"; now the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> contained in the next two verses is taken from <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where it is put in the mouth of the "King the Lord of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">hosts</a>". In other places he uses the words <em>God </em>and <em>Holy Ghost </em>as plainly synonymous. Thus he writes (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>): "Know you not, that you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" and in <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs19">6:19</a>: "Or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you . . . ?" St. Peter asserts the same identity when he thus remonstrates with Ananias (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs3">Acts 5:3-4</a>): "Why hath <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">tempted</a> thy heart, that thou shouldst <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> to the Holy Ghost . . . ? Thou hast not <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lied</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The sacred writers attribute to the Holy Ghost all the works characteristic of Divine power. It is in His name, as in the name of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is to be given (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>). It is by His operation that the greatest of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">Divine mysteries</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, is accomplished (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs18">Matthew 1:18, 20</a>; <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs35">Luke 1:35</a>). It is also in His name and by His power that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> sanctified: "Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">John 20:22-23</a>); "But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justified</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the Spirit of our God" (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>); "The charity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>). He is essentially the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs16">John 14:16-17</a>; <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs26">15:26</a>), Whose office it is to strengthen <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs5">Acts 6:5</a>), to bestow wisdom (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs3">Acts 6:3</a>), to give testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is to say, to confirm His teaching inwardly (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs26">John 15:26</a>), and to teach the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the full meaning of it (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs26">John 14:26</a>; <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs13">16:13</a>). With these <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> He will abide for ever (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs16">John 14:16</a>). Having descended on them at Pentecost, He will guide them in their work (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs29">Acts 8:29</a>), for He will inspire the new <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs28">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs9">13:9</a>), as He <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs51">Acts 7:51</a>). He is the source of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 12:3-11</a>); He, in particular, grants the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs4">Acts 2:4</a>; <a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs44">10:44-47</a>). And as he dwells in our bodies sanctifies them (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs19">6:19</a>), so will and them he raise them again, one day, from the dead (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs11">Romans 8:11</a>). But he operates especially in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, giving it a new life (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9 sq.</a>), being the pledge that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given us that we are his children (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs14">Romans 8:14-16</a>; <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs22">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs5">5:5</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs6">Galatians 4:6</a>). He is the Spirit of God, and at the same time the Spirit of Christ (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9</a>); because He is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He knows the deepest <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/1co002.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 2:10-11</a>), and He possesses all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> ends his <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#vrs13">Second Epistle to the Corinthians (13:13)</a> with this formula of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">benediction</a>, which might be called a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the Trinity: "The grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the charity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all." &#151; Cf. Tixeront, "Hist. des dogmes", Paris, 1905, I, 80, 89, 90, 100, 101.
<h3 id="B">Tradition</h3>

<p>While corroborating and explaining the testimony of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> brings more clearly before us the various stages of the evolution of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>As early as the first century, <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> gives us important teaching about the Holy Ghost. His <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">"Epistle to the Corinthians"</a> not only tells us that the Spirit <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> and guided the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writers (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm">8.1</a>; <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">45.2</a>); that He is the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> speaking to us in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm">22.1 sq.</a>); but it contains further, two very explicit statements about the Trinity. In <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">46.6</a> (Funk, "Patres apostolici", 2nd ed., I,158), we read that "we have only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one Christ, one only Spirit of grace within us, one same vocation in Christ". In <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">58.2</a> (Funk, ibid., 172), the author makes this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> affirmation; <em>zo gar ho theos, kai zo ho kyrios Iesous Christos kai to pneuma to hagion, he te pistis kai he elpis ton eklekton, oti . . .</em> which we may compare with the formula so frequently met with in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: <em>zo kyrios.</em> From this it follows that, in Clement's view, <em>kyrios</em> was equally applicable to <em>ho theos</em> (the Father), <em>ho kyrios Iesous Christos</em>, and <em>to pneuma to hagion</em>; and that we have three <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of equal authority, whose Trinity, moreover, is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>.

<p>The same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is declared, in the second and third centuries, by the lips of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and is found in the writings of the Fathers. <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> (d. 155), in his torments, thus professed his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Three Adorable Persons</a> (<a href="../fathers/0102.htm">"Martyrium sancti Polycarpi"</a> in <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">Funk</a>, op. cit., I, 330): "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God Almighty</a>, Father of Thy blessed and well beloved Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> . . . in everything I praise Thee, I <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> Thee, I glorify Thee by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and celestial <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">pontiff</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Thy well beloved Son, by whom, to Thee, with Him and with the Holy Ghost, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> now and for ever!"

<p>St. Epipodius spoke more distinctly still (Ruinart, "Acta mart.", <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> edition, p. 65): "I confess that Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the Father and the Holy Ghost, and it is fitting that I should give back my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to Him Who is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> and my Redeemer."

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologists</a>, <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a> mentions the Holy Ghost along with, and on the same plane as, the Father and the Son. "Who would not be astonished", says he (<a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em> 10</a>), "to hear us called <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>, us who confess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a> and the Holy Ghost, and hold them one in power and distinct in order [. . .<em> ten en te henosei dynamin, kai ten en te taxei diairesin</em>]?"

<p><a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a>, who sometimes gives to the Holy Ghost, as to the Son, the name of <em>Wisdom</em> (<em>sophia</em>), mentions besides (<a href="../fathers/02041.htm"><em>To Autolycus</em> I.7</a> and <a href="../fathers/02042.htm">II.18</a>) the three terms <em>theos, logos, sophia</em> and, being the first to apply the characteristic word that was afterwards adopted, says expressly (<a href="../fathers/02042.htm">II.15</a>) that they form a <em>trinity</em> (<em>trias</em>).

<p><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> looks upon the Holy Ghost as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103512.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.12.2</a>), existing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <em>ante omnem constitutionem, </em>and produced by him at the beginning of His ways (<a href="../fathers/0103420.htm">IV.20.3</a>). Considered with regard to the Father, the Holy Ghost is his wisdom (<a href="../fathers/0103420.htm">IV.20.3</a>); the Son and He are the "two hands" by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103400.htm">IV.Preface.4</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103420.htm">IV.20.20</a> and <a href="../fathers/0103506.htm">V.6.1</a>). Considered with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the same Spirit is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, grace, a pledge of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, a principle of union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; intimately united to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He gives the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> their efficacy and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103317.htm">III.17.2</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103324.htm">III.24.1</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103433.htm">IV.33.7</a> and <a href="../fathers/0103508.htm">V.8.1</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>, though he does not speak at all clearly of the Holy Ghost regarded as a distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, supposes him, however, to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as well as the Father and the Son (<a href="../fathers/0521.htm"><em>Against Noetus</em> 8, 12</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is one of the writers of this age whose tendency to Subordinationism is most apparent, and that in spite of his being the author of the definitive formula: "Three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>". And yet his teaching on the Holy Ghost is in every way remarkable. He seems to have been the first among the Fathers to affirm His Divinity in a clear and absolutely precise manner. In his work <a href="../fathers/0317.htm">"Adversus Praxean"</a> he dwells at length on the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>. The Holy Ghost, he says, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../fathers/0317.htm">13</a>); of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Father (<a href="../fathers/0317.htm">3</a> and <a href="../fathers/0317.htm">4</a>); one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the Father and the Son (<a href="../fathers/0317.htm">2</a>); proceeding from the Father through the Son (<a href="../fathers/0317.htm">4</a>, <a href="../fathers/0317.htm">8</a>); teaching all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (<a href="../fathers/0317.htm">2</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, or at least the <em>Ekthesis tes pisteos</em>, which is commonly attributed to him, and which dates from the period 260-270, gives us this remarkable passage (P.G., X, 933 sqq.): "One is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father of the living Word, of the subsisting Wisdom. . . . One the Lord, one of one, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, invisible of invisible. . .One the Holy Ghost, having His subsistence from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. . . . Perfect Trinity, which in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and power, is neither divided, nor separated. . . . Unchanging and immutable Trinity."

<p>In 304, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/15434b.htm">St. Vincent</a> said (Ruinart, op. cit., 325): "I confess the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Son of the Father most High, one of one; I recognize Him as one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the Father and the Holy Ghost."

<p>But we must come down towards the year 360 to find the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the Holy Ghost explained both fully and clearly. It is <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> who does so in his "Letters to Serapion" (P.G., XXVI, col. 525 sq.). He had been informed that certain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> held that the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity was a creature. To refute them he questions the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, and they furnish him with arguments as solid as they are numerous. They tell him, in particular, that the Holy Ghost is united to the Son by relations just like those existing between the Son and the Father; that He is sent by the Son; that He is His mouth-piece and glorifies Him; that, unlike creatures, He has not been made out of nothing, but comes forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that He performs a sanctifying work among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of which no creature is capable; that in possessing Him we possess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that the Father <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> everything by Him; that, in fine, He is immutable, has the attributes of immensity, oneness, and has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to all the appellations that are used to express the dignity of the Son. Most of these conclusions he supports by means of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> texts, a few from amongst which are given above. But the writer lays special stress on what is read in <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>. "The Lord", he writes (Ad Serap., III, n. 6, in P.G., XXVI, 633 sq.), "founded the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the Trinity, when He said to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>: 'Going therefore, teach ye all nations; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the Holy Ghost.' If the Holy Ghost were a creature, Christ would not have associated Him with the Father; He would have avoided making a heterogeneous Trinity, composed of unlike elements. What did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stand in need of? Did He need to join to Himself a being of different <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>? . . . No, the Trinity is not composed of the Creator and the creature."

<p>A little later, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/04784a.htm">Didymus of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> took up the same thesis <em>ex professo</em>, supporting it for the most part with the same <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. All these writings had prepared the way for the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Council of Constantinople</a> which, in 381, condemned the <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachians</a> and <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. This teaching forms part of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed of Constantinople</a>, as it is called, where the symbol refers to the Holy Ghost, "Who is also our Lord and Who gives life; Who proceeds from the Father, Who is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> and glorified together with the Father and the Son; Who spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>". Was this <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>, with these particular words, approved by the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">council of 381</a>? Formerly that was the common opinion, and even in recent times it has been held by authorities like <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">Funk</a>; other <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historians</a>, amongst whom are Harnack and Duchesne, are of the contrary opinion; but all agree in admitting that the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> of which we are speaking was received and approved by the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, in 451, and that, at least from that time, it became the official formula of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Procession of the Holy Ghost</h2>

<p>We need not dwell at length on the precise meaning of the <em>Procession </em>in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">T<font size=-2>RINITY</font></a>.) It will suffice here to remark that by this word we mean the relation of origin that exists between one Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> and another, or between one and the two others as its principle of origin. The Son proceeds from the Father; the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son. The latter <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be specially treated here.
<h3>A</h3>

<p>That the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father has always been admitted by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is expressly stated in <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs26">John 15:26</a>. But the Greeks, after <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, deny that He proceeds from the Son. And yet such is manifestly the teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the Fathers.

<h4 id="i">In the New Testament</h4>

<p>(a) The Holy Ghost is called the Spirit of Christ (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9</a>), the Spirit of the Son (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs6">Galatians 4:6</a>), the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs7">Acts 16:7</a>). These terms imply a relation of the Spirit to the Son, which can only be a relation of origin. This conclusion is so much the more indisputable as all admit the similar argument to explain why the Holy Ghost is called the Spirit of the Father. Thus <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> argues (<a href="../fathers/1701099.htm">Tractate 99 on the Gospel of John, nos. 6-7</a>): "You hear the Lord himself declare: 'It is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you'. Likewise you hear the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> declare: '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts. Could there then be two <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a>, one the spirit of the Father, the other the spirit of the Son? Certainly not. Just as there is only one Father, just as there is only one Lord or one Son, so there is only one Spirit, Who is, consequently, the Spirit of both. . . Why then should you refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He proceeds also from the Son, since He is also the Spirit of the Son? If He did not proceed from Him, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, when He appeared to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, would not have breathed on them, saying: 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost'. What, indeed, does this breathing signify, but that the Spirit proceeds also from Him?" <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> had argued in exactly the same way (De Trinit. et Spir. S., n. 19, in P.G., XXVI, 1212), and concluded: "We say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is also the source of the Spirit."

<p>(b) The Holy Ghost <em>receives</em> from the Son, according to <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs13">John 16:13-15</a>: "When he, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is come he will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you. He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <em>it</em> to you. All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew <em>it</em> to you." Now, one Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> can receive from another only by Procession, being related to that other as to a principle. What the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> will receive from the Son is <a href="../cathen/07682a.htm">immanent</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which He will afterwards manifest exteriorly. But this <a href="../cathen/07682a.htm">immanent</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Holy Ghost. The latter, therefore, has His origin in the Son, the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son. "He shall not speak of Himself", says <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/1701099.htm">Tractate 99 on the Gospel of John, no. 4</a>), "because He is not from Himself, but He shall tell you all He shall have heard. He shall hear from him from whom He proceeds. In His case, to hear is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is to be. He derives His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from Him from Whom He derives His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>." <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> remarks that the words: "He shall receive of mine" signify "the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" which the Holy Ghost has from the Son, as the Son has His from the Father (De Trinit., dialog. vi, in P.G., LXXV, 1011). Besides, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> gives this reason of His assertion: "He shall receive of mine": "All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine Now, since the Father has with regard to the Holy Ghost the relation we term Active Spiration, the Son has it also; and in the Holy Ghost there exists, consequently, with regard to both, Passive Spiration or Procession.

<h4 id="ii">The same truth has been constantly held by the Fathers</h4>

<p>This fact is undisputed as far as the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> Fathers are concerned; but the Greeks deny it in the case of the Easterns. We will cite, therefore, a few witnesses from among the latter. The testimony of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> has been quoted above, to the effect that "the Son is the source of the Spirit", and the statement of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> that the Holy Ghost has His "nature" from the Son. The latter saint further asserts (Thesaur., assert. xxxiv in P.G., LXXV, 585); "When the Holy Ghost comes into our hearts, He makes us like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He proceeds from the Father and the Son"; and again (Epist., xvii, Ad Nestorium, De excommunicatione in P.G., LXXVII, 117): "The Holy Ghost is not unconnected with the Son, for He is called the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a>, and Christ is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a>; so He proceeds from Him as well as from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>." <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (<a href="../fathers/3203.htm"><em>On the Holy Spirit</em> 18</a>) wishes us not to depart from the traditional order in mentioning the Three Divine Persons, because "as the Son is to the Father, so is the Spirit to the Son, in accordance with the ancient order of the names in the formula of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>". <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> writes (Ancor., viii, in P.G., XLIII, 29, 30) that the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> "is not to be considered as unconnected with the Father and the Son, for He is with Them one in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and divinity", and states that "He is from the Father and the Son"; a little further, he adds (op. cit., xi, in P.G., XLIII, 35): "No one knows the Spirit, besides the Father, except the Son, from Whom He proceeds and of Whom He receives." Lastly, a council held at <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> in 410 proclaims its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> "in the Holy Living Spirit, the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Holy Living Paraclete</a>, Who proceeds from the Father and the Son" (<a href="../cathen/08772b.htm">Lamy</a>, "Concilium Seleuci&aelig;", Louvain, 1868).

<p>However, when we compare the Latin writers, as a body, with the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> writers, we notice a difference in language: while the former almost unanimously affirm that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and <em>from </em>the Son, the latter generally say that He proceeds from the Father <em>through </em>the Son. In reality the thought expressed by both Greeks and Latins is one and the same, only the manner of expressing it is slightly different: the Greek formula <em>ek tou patros dia tou ouiou</em> expresses directly the order according to which the Father and the Son are the principle of the Holy Ghost, and implies their equality as principle; the Latin formula expresses directly this equality, and implies the order. As the Son Himself proceeds from the Father, it is from the Father that He receives, with everything else, the virtue that makes Him the principle of the Holy Ghost. Thus, the Father alone is <em>principium absque principio, aitia anarchos prokatarktike, </em>and, comparatively, the Son is an intermediate principle. The distinct use of the two prepositions, <em>ek</em> (from) and <em>dia</em> (through), implies nothing else. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> <a href="../cathen/02596c.htm">Blemmidus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02380b.htm">Beccus</a>, Calecas, and <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> called attention to this, explaining that the two particles have the same signification, but that <em>from </em>is better suited to the First <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, Who is the source of the others, and <em>through </em>to the Second <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, Who comes from the Father. Long before their <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> had written (<a href="../fathers/3203.htm"><em>On the Holy Spirit</em> 8.21</a>): "The expression<em> di ou</em> expresses acknowledgment of the primordial principle [<em> tes prokatarktikes aitias</em>]"; and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (<a href="../fathers/240105.htm">Homily 5 on the Gospel of John, no. 2</a>): "If it be said <em>through Him, </em>it is said solely in order that no one may imagine that the Son is not generated": It may be added that the terminology used by the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> writers, respectively, to express the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is far from being invariable. Just as <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril</a>, Epiphanius, and other Greeks affirm the Procession <em>ex utroque, </em>so several Latin writers did not consider they were departing from the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">their Church</a> in expressing themselves like the Greeks. Thus <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0317.htm"><em>Against Praxeas</em> 4</a>): "Spiritum non aliunde puto quam a Patre per Filium"; and St. Hilary (<a href="../fathers/330212.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> XII.57</a>), addressing himself to the Father, protests that he wishes to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, with Him and the Son "Thy Holy Spirit, Who comes from Thee through thy only Son". And yet the same writer had said, a little higher (op. cit., lib. II, 29, in P.L., X, 69), "that we must confess the Holy Ghost coming from the Father and the Son", a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the two formul&aelig; were regarded as substantially equivalent.
<h3>B</h3>

<p>Proceeding both from the Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost, nevertheless, proceeds from Them as from a single principle. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, at the very least insinuated in the passage of <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs15">John 16:15</a> (cited above), where Christ establishes a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection between His own sharing in all the Father has and the Procession of the Holy Ghost. Hence it follows, indeed, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the two other Persons, not in so far as They are distinct, but inasmuch as Their Divine perfection is numerically one. Besides, such is the explicit teaching of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, which is concisely put by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/130105.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> V.14</a>): "As the Father and the Son are only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and, relatively to the creature, only one Creator and one Lord, so, relatively to the Holy Ghost, They are only one principle." This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> in the following words by the <a href="../cathen/09476a.htm">Second Ecumenical Council of Lyons</a> [<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion" (1908), n. 460]: "We confess that the Holy Ghost proceeds <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles, but as from one principle, not by two spirations, but by one single spiration." The teaching was again laid down by the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (ibid., n. 691), and by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cantate Domino" (ibid., n. 703 sq.).
<h3>C</h3>

<p>It is likewise an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> that the Holy Ghost does not proceed, like the Second <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> of the Trinity, by way of generation. Not only is the Second <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> alone called <em>Son </em>in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, not only is He alone said to be <em>begotten, </em>but He is also called the <em>only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>; the ancient symbol that bears the name of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Saint Athanasius</a> states expressly that "the Holy Ghost comes from the Father and from the Son not made, not <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a>, not generated, but proceeding". As we are utterly incapable of otherwise fixing the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> mode affecting this relation of origin, we apply to it the name <em>spiration, </em>the signification of which is principally negative and by way of contrast, in the sense that it affirms a Procession peculiar to the Holy Ghost and exclusive of filiation. But though we distinguish absolutely and essentially between generation and spiration, it is a very delicate and difficult task to say what the difference is. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/1027.htm">I.27</a>), following <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/130115.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> XV.27</a>), finds the explanation and, as it the were, the epitome, of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in principle that, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Son proceeds through the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a> and the Holy Ghost through the Will. The Son is, in the language of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, the <em>image </em>of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Invisible God</a>, His <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, His uncreated <em>wisdom. </em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> contemplates Himself and knows Himself from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and, knowing Himself, He forms within Himself a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Himself, and this <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> thought is His <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>. Now every act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is accomplished by the production in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of a representation of the object <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; from this head, then the process offers a certain <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> with generation, which is the production by a living being of a being partaking of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> is only so much the more striking when there is question of this act of Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> term of which is a <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, consubstantial within the knowing subject. As to the Holy Ghost, according to the common <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, He proceeds through the will. The Holy Spirit, as His name indicates, is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Holy</a> in virtue of His origin, His <em>spiration</em>; He comes therefore from a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> principle; now <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> resides in the will, as wisdom is in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. That is also the reason why He is so often called <em>par excellence, </em>in the writings of the Fathers, <em>Love </em>and <em>Charity. </em>The Father and the Son <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, with a perfect ineffable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; the term of this <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> fruitful mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is Their Spirit Who is co-eternal and con-substantial with Them. Only, the Holy Ghost is not indebted to the manner of His Procession precisely for this perfect resemblance to His principle, in other words for His <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a>; for to will or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> an object does not formally imply the production of its <a href="../cathen/07682a.htm">immanent</a> image in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that loves, but rather a tendency, a movement of the will towards the thing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>, to be united to it and enjoy it. So, making every allowance for the feebleness of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a> in knowing, and the unsuitability of our words for expressing the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Divine life, if we can grasp how the word <em>generation, </em>freed from all the imperfections of the material order may be applied by <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> to the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, so we may see that the term can in no way befittingly applied to the Procession of the Holy Ghost.
<h2 id="section5">Filioque</h2>

<p>Having treated of the part taken by the Son in the Procession of the Holy Ghost, we come next to consider the introduction of the expression <a href="../cathen/06073a.htm"><em>Filioque</em></a> into the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> of Constantinople. The author of the addition is unknown, but the first trace of it is found in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06073a.htm"><em>Filioque</em></a> was successively introduced into the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Symbol</a> of the Council of Toledo in 447, then, in pursuance of an order of another <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in the same place (589), it was inserted in the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed</a>. Admitted likewise into the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Symbol <em>Quicumque</em></a>, it began to appear in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the eighth century. It was <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chanted</a> in 767, in <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Gentilly, where it was heard by ambassadors from Constantine Copronymnus. The Greeks were astonished and protested, explanations were given by the Latins, and many discussions followed. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11586a.htm">Paulinus</a>, defended the addition at the Council of Friuli, in 796. It was afterwards accepted by a council held at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, in 809. However, as it proved a stumbling-block to the Greeks <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a> disapproved of it; and, though he entirely agreed with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> on the question of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he advised them to omit the new word. He himself caused two large silver tablets, on which the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> with the disputed expression omitted was engraved to be erected in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. His advice was unheeded by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>; and, as the conduct and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a> seemed to justify the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Westerns</a> in paying no more regard to the feelings of the Greeks, the addition of the words was accepted by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">Funk</a>, "Kirchengeschichte", Paderborn, 1902, p. 243).

<p>The Greeks have always blamed the Latins for making the addition. They considered that, quite apart from the question of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> involved by the expression, the insertion was made in violation of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a>, forbidding anyone "to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the Fathers of Nic&aelig;a". Such a reason will not bear examination. Supposing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> (established above), it is inadmissible that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could or would have deprived herself of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to mention it in the symbol. If the opinion be adhered to, and it has strong arguments to support it, which considers that the developments of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> in what concerns the Holy Ghost were approved by the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Council of Constantinople (381)</a>, at once it might be laid down that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Ephesus</a> (431) certainly did not think of condemning or blaming those of <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Constantinople</a>. But, from the fact that the disputed expression was authorized by the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, in 451, we conclude that the prohibition of the <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Council of Ephesus</a> was never understood, and ought not to be understood, in an absolute sense. It may be considered either as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, or as a merely disciplinary pronouncement. In the first case it would exclude any addition or modification opposed to, or at variance with, the deposit of Revelation; and such seems to be its historic import, for it was proposed and accepted by the Fathers to oppose a formula tainted with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. In the second case considered as a disciplinary measure, it can bind only those who are not the depositaries of the supreme power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The latter, as it is their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to teach the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to preserve it from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, possess, by Divine authority, the power and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to draw up and propose to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> such confessions of faith as circumstances may demand. This <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> is as unconfinable as it is inalienable.
<h2 id="section6">Gifts of the Holy Ghost</h2>

<p>This title and the theory connected with it, like the theory of the fruits of the Holy Ghost and that of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Holy Ghost, imply what <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> call <a href="../cathen/01658a.htm"><em>appropriation</em></a>. By this term is meant attributing especially to one Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a> perfections and exterior works which seem to us more clearly or more immediately to be connected with Him, when we consider His personal characteristics, but which in reality are common to the Three Persons. It is in this sense that we attribute to the Father the perfection of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, with its most striking manifestations, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">Creation</a>, because He is the principle of the two other Persons; to the Son we attribute wisdom and the works of wisdom, because He proceeds from the Father by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>; to the Holy Ghost we attribute the operations of grace and the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and in particular spiritual <em><a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a></em> and <em>fruits</em>, because He proceeds from the Father and the Son as Their mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and is called in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Holy Writ</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and the charity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the Holy Ghost are of two kinds: the first are specially intended for the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who receives them; the second, more properly called <em><a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a></em>, are extraordinary favours granted for the help of another, favours, too, which do not sanctify by themselves, and may even be separated from <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Those of the first class are accounted seven in number, as enumerated by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (11:2-3), where the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> sees and describes them in the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. They are the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of wisdom, understanding, counsel, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> (godliness), and fear of the Lord.

<ul> <li>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of wisdom, by detaching us from the world, makes us relish and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only the things of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of understanding helps us to grasp the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion as far as is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of counsel springs from <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and enables us to see and choose correctly what will help most to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <li>By the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> we receive <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to overcome the obstacles and difficulties that arise in the practice of our religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> points out to us the path to follow and the dangers to avoid in order to reach <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, by inspiring us with a tender and filial confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, makes us joyfully embrace all that pertains to His service. <li>Lastly, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of fear fills us with a sovereign respect for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and makes us dread, above all things, to offend Him.</ul>

<p>As to the inner nature of these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> consider them to be <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and permanent <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">qualities</a>, which make us attentive to the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which render us susceptible to the workings of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, which make us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, consequently, render us more <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and docile to the inspirations of the Holy Ghost.

<p>But how do they differ from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>? Some writers think they are not really distinct from them, that they are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> inasmuch as the latter are <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">free gifts of God</a>, and that they are identified essentially with grace, charity, and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. That opinion has the particular merit of avoiding a multiplication of the entities infused into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Other writers look upon the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> as perfections of a higher order than the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; the latter, they say, dispose us to follow the impulse and guidance of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; the former are functionally intended to render the will obedient and docile to the inspirations of the Holy Ghost. For the former opinion, see Bellev&uuml;e, "L'uvre du Saint-Esprit" (Paris, 1902), 99 sq.; and for the latter, see <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/2068.htm#article1">I-II.68.1</a>, and Froget, "De l'habitation du Saint-Esprit dans les &acirc;mes justes" (Paris, 1900), 378 sq.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the second class, or <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us partly from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and partly from the history of the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the bosom of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> plentifully bestowed them. Of these "manifestations of the Spirit", "all these things [that] one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will", the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> speaks to us, particularly in <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs6">1 Corinthians 12:6-11</a> and <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs28">12:28-31</a>; and <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#vrs6">Romans 12:6-8</a>.

<p>In the first of these three passages we find nine <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> mentioned: the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of speaking with wisdom, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of speaking with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the grace of healing, the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">gift of prophecy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05028b.htm">gift of discerning spirits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of interpreting speeches. To this list we must at least add, as being found in the other two passages indicated, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of government, the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of helps, and perhaps what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls <em>distributio</em> and <em>misericordia</em>. However, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> are not all agreed as to the number of the <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each one of them; long ago, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> had pointed out the obscurity of the question. Adhering to the most probable views on the subject, we may at once classify the <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> and explain the meaning of most of them as follows. They form four natural groups:

<ul> <li>Two <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> which regard the teaching of Divine things: <em>sermo sapienti&aelig;, sermo scienti&aelig;, </em>the former relating to the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">higher mysteries</a>, the latter to the body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. <li>Three <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> that lend support to this teaching: <em>fides, gratia sanitatum, operatio virtutum. </em>The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> here spoken of is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the sense used by <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs19">Matthew 17:19</a>: that which works wonders; so it is, as it were, a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> and a part of the two <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> mentioned with it. <li>Four <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> that served to edify, exhort, and encourage the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and to confound the unbelievers: <em>prophetia, discretio spirituum, genera linguarum, interpretatio sermonum. </em>These four seem to fall <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> into two groups; for <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which is essentially inspired pronouncement on different religious subjects, the declaration of the future being only of secondary import, finds its complement and, as it were, its check in the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/05028b.htm">discerning spirits</a>; and what, as a rule, would be the use of <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm"><em>glossololia</em></a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">speaking with tongues</a> &#151; if the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of interpreting them were wanting? <li>Lastly there remain the <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> that seem to have as object the administration of temporal affairs, amid <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>: <em>gubernationes, opitulationes, distributiones. </em>Judging by the context, these <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, though conferred and useful for the direction and comfort of one's neighbour, were in no way necessarily found in all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors. </ul>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a>, being extraordinary favours and not requisite for the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, were not bestowed indiscriminately on all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. However, in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age, they were comparatively common, especially in the communities of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. The reason of this is apparent: in the infant <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> the <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> were extremely useful, and even <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morally</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of believers, to confound the <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>, to make them reflect, and to counterbalance the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> with which they sometimes prevailed. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> was careful (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12-14</a>) to restrict authoritatively the use of these <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a> within the ends for which they were bestowed, and thus insist upon their subordination to the power of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Cf. Batiffol, "L'&Eacute;glise naissante et le catholicisme" (Paris, 1909), 36. (See <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">C<font size=-2>HARISMATA</font></a>.)
<h2 id="section7">Fruits of the Holy Ghost</h2>

<p>Some writers extend this term to all the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, or rather to the acts of all these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, inasmuch as they are the results of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> workings of the Holy Ghost in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by means of His grace. But, with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/2070.htm#article2">I-II.70.2</a>, the word is ordinarily restricted to mean only those <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> works that are done joyfully and with peace of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is the sense in which most authorities apply the term to the list mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs22">Galatians 5:22-23</a>): "But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, patience, benignity, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, longanimity, mildness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, modesty, continency, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>." Moreover, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this list of twelve &#151; three of the twelve are omitted in several Greek and Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> &#151; is not to be taken in a strictly limited sense, but, according to the rules of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> language, as capable of being extended to include all acts of a similar <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. That is why the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> says: "Every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> performs with pleasure is a fruit." The fruits of the Holy Ghost are not habits, permanent <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">qualities</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">acts</a>. They cannot, therefore, be confounded with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, from which they are distinguished as the effect is from its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or the stream from its source. The charity, patience, mildness, etc., of which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> speaks in this passage, are not then the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves, but rather their acts or operations; for, however perfect the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> may be, they cannot be considered as the ultimate effects of grace, being themselves intended, inasmuch as they are active principles, to produce something else, i.e. their acts. Further, in order that these acts may fully justify their metaphorical name of <em>fruits, </em>they must belong to that class which are performed with ease and pleasure; in other words, the difficulty involved in performing them must disappear in presence of the delight and satisfaction resulting from the good accomplished.
<h2 id="section8">Sins against the Holy Ghost</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Holy Ghost is mentioned in <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs22">Matthew 12:22-32</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs22">Mark 3:22-30</a>; <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs10">Luke 12:10</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs14">11:14-23</a>); and Christ everywhere declares that it shall not be pardoned. In what does it consist? If we examine all the passages alluded to, there can be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the reply.

<p>Let us take, for instance, the account given by <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a> which is more complete than that of the other <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>. There had been brought to Christ "one <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, blind and dumb: and he healed him, so that he spoke and saw". While the crowd is wondering, and asking: "Is not this the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>?", the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, yielding to their wonted <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">jealousy</a>, and shutting their eyes to the light of evidence, say: "This man <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">casteth not out devils</a> but by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>." <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> then <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> to them this absurdity, and, consequently, the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of their explanation; He shows them that it is by "the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" that He <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">casts out devils</a>, and then He concludes: "therefore I say to you: Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not he forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come."

<p>So, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Holy Ghost is to confound Him with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it is to deny, from pure <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, the Divine <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of works manifestly Divine. This is the sense in which <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">St. Mark</a> also defines the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> question; for, after reciting the words of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a>: "But he that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the Holy Ghost shall never have forgiveness", he adds at once: "Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit." With this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of pure downright <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> contrasts the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> "against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>", that is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed against Himself as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the wrong done to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> in judging Him by His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and lowly appearance. This fault, unlike the former, might he excused as the result of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and misunderstanding.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, commenting on the Gospel texts we are treating of, did not confine themselves to the meaning given above. Whether it be that they wished to group together all objectively analogous cases, or whether they hesitated and wavered when confronted with this point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> declares (Serm. ii de verbis Domini, c. v) one of the most difficult in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, they have proposed different interpretations or explanations.

<p><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, whom we may safely follow, gives a very good summary of opinions in <a href="../summa/3014.htm">II-II.14</a>. He says that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Holy Ghost was and may be explained in three ways.

<ul> <li>Sometimes, and in its most literal signification, it has been taken to mean the uttering of an insult against the Divine Spirit, applying the appellation either to the Holy Ghost or to all three Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. This was the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who spoke at first against <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">"the Son of Man"</a>, criticizing the works and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ways of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, accusing Him of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> good cheer and wine, of associating with the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, and who, later on, with undoubted bad faith, traduced His Divine works, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He wrought by virtue of His own Divinity. <li>On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> frequently explains <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Holy Ghost to be final impenitence, <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">perseverance till death</a> in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This impenitence is against the Holy Ghost, in the sense that it frustrates and is absolutely opposed to the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and this remission is <a href="../cathen/01658a.htm">appropriated</a> to the Holy Ghost, the mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father and the Son. In this view, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in <a href="../bible/mat012.htm">Matthew 12</a> and <a href="../bible/mar003.htm">Mark 3</a> did not really accuse the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> of blaspheming the Holy Ghost, He only warned them against the danger they were in of doing so. <li>Finally, several <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, and after them, many <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theologians</a>, apply the expression to all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> directly opposed to that <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> which is, by <a href="../cathen/01658a.htm">appropriation</a>, the characteristic <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of the Third Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>. Charity and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> are especially attributed to the Holy Ghost, as power is to the Father and wisdom to the Son. Just, then, as they termed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Father those that resulted from frailty, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Son those that sprang from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Holy Ghost are those that are committed from downright <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, either by despising or rejecting the inspirations and impulses which, having been stirred in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the Holy Ghost, would turn him away or deliver him from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. </ul>

<p>It is easy to see how this wide explanation suits all the circumstances of the case where Christ addresses the words to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. These <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are commonly reckoned six: <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, <a href="../cathen/12403a.htm">presumption</a>, impenitence or a fixed determination not to repent, obstinacy, resisting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of another's spiritual welfare.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Holy Ghost are said to be unpardonable, but the meaning of this assertion will vary very much according to which of the three explanations given above is accepted. As to final impenitence it is absolute; and this is easily understood, for even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot pardon where there is no <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a>, and the moment of death is the fatal instant after which no mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted. It was because <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> considered <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words to imply absolute unpardonableness that he held the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Holy Ghost to be solely final impenitence. In the other two explanations, according to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Holy Ghost is remissable &#151; not absolutely and always, but inasmuch as (considered in itself) it has not the claims and extenuating circumstance, inclining towards a pardon, that might be alleged in the case of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of weakness and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. He who, from pure and deliberate <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, refuses to recognize the manifest work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rejects the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, acts exactly like a sick man who not only refuses all medicine and all food, but who does all in his power to increase his illness, and whose malady becomes incurable, due to his own action. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that in either case, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could, by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, overcome the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; He could, by His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> intervention, either nullify the natural causes of bodily death, or radically change the will of the stubborn sinner; but such intervention is not in accordance with His ordinary <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; and if he allows the secondary causes to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, if He offers the free human will of ordinary but sufficient grace, who shall seek cause of complaint? In a word, the irremissableness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the Holy Ghost is exclusively on the part of the sinner, on account of the sinner's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>.
