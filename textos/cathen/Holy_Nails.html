<h1>Holy Nails</h1>  

<p>The question has long been debated whether <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was crucified with three or with four nails.

<p>The treatment of the Crucifixion in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> during the earlier <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> strongly supports the tradition of four nails, and the language of certain historical writers (none, however, earlier than <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, "De glor. mart.", vi; for the supposed sermon of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, "De passione", is a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> fabrication), favours the same view.

<p>On the other hand, in the thirteenth century, Western <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> began to represent the feet of the Crucified as placed one over the other and pierced with a single nail. This accords with the language of <a href="../cathen/11100a.htm">Nonnus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and with the poem "Christus patiens" attributed to <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzus</a>, which speaks of three nails. More recent archaeological criticism has pointed out not only that the two earliest representations of the Crucifixion (the Palatine <em>graffito</em> does not here come into account), viz., the carved door of the Santa Sabina in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> panel of the British Museum, show no signs of nails in the feet, but that <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> ("De obitu Theodosii" in P.L., XVI, 1402) and other early writers distinctly imply that there were only two nails. Further, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> informs us that <a href="../cathen/07202b.htm">St. Helen</a> had one nail converted into a bridle for <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine's</a> horse (early commentators quote <a href="../bible/zec014.htm#vrs20">Zechariah 14:20</a>, in this connection), and that an imperial diadem was made out of the other nail. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> speaks of a nail being thrown (<em>deponi</em>), or possibly dipped into the Adriatic to calm a storm. It is impossible to discuss these problems adequately in brief space, but the information derivable from the general archaeology of the punishment of crucifixion as known to the Romans does not in any way contradict the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition of four nails.

<p>Very little reliance can be placed upon the authenticity of the thirty or more holy nails which are still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, or which have been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> until recent times, in such treasuries as that of Santa Croce in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or those of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, the Escurial, <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, etc. Probably the majority began by professing to be facsimiles which had touched or contained filings from some other nail whose claim was more ancient. Without conscious <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> on the part of anyone, it is very easy for imitations in this way to come in a very brief space of time to be reputed originals. The bridle of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a> is believed to be identical with a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of this form which for several centuries has been preserved at Carpentras, but there is another claimant of the same kind at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Similarly the diadem of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a> is asserted to be at Monza, and it has long been known as "the iron crown of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>."
