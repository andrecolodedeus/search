<h1>Holy Name of Jesus</h1>  

<p>We give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">Name of Jesus</a>, not because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is any intrinsic power hidden in the letters composing it, but because the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> reminds us of all the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> we receive through our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Holy Redeemer</a>. To give thanks for these <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> we revere the Holy Name, as we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a> by honouring His Cross (Colvenerius, "De festo SS. Nominis", ix). At the Holy Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> we uncover our heads, and we bend our knees; it is at the head of all our undertakings, as the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> says in his law-book: "In the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus</a> we begin all our consultations". The Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> invoked with confidence <ul><li>brings help in bodily needs, according to the promise of Christ: "In my name They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">lay their hands</a> upon the sick, and they shall recover". (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17-18</a>) In the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> gave strength to the lame (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs6">Acts 3:6</a>; <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs34">9:34</a>) and life to the dead (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs40">Acts 9:40</a>). <li>It gives consolation in spiritual trials. The Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> reminds the sinner of the prodigal son's father and of the Good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>; it recalls to the just the suffering and death of the innocent Lamb of God. <li>It protects us against <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his wiles, for the Devil fears the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who has conquered him on the Cross. <li>In the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> we obtain every blessing and grace for <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, for Christ has said: "If you ask the Father anything in my name he will give it you." (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs23">John 16:23</a>) Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concludes all her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> by the words: "Through Our Lord Jesus Christ", etc.</ul> So the word of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is fulfilled: "That in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of those that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, and under the earth" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs10">Philippians 2:10</a>).

<p>A special lover of the Holy Name was <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, who speaks of it in most glowing terms in many of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>. But the greatest promoters of this devotion were <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452a.htm">St. John Capistran</a>. They carried with them on their missions in the turbulent cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> a copy of the monogram of the Holy Name, surrounded by rays, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on a wooden tablet, wherewith they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> the sick and wrought great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. At the close of their sermons they exhibited this emblem to the faithful and asked them to prostrate themselves, to adore the Redeemer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. They recommended their hearers to have the <a href="../cathen/07649a.htm">monogram of Jesus</a> placed over the gates of their cities and above the doors of their dwelling (cf. Seeberger, "Key to the Spiritual Treasures", 1897, 102). Because the manner in which St. Bernardine preached this devotion was new, he was accused by his enemies, and brought before the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>. But St. John Capistran defended his master so successfully that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> not only permitted the worship of the Holy Name, but also assisted at a procession in which the holy monogram was carried. The tablet used by St. Bernardine is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Santa Maria in Ara Coeli at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The emblem or monogram representing the Holy Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> consists of the three letters: <a href="../cathen/07649a.htm">IHS</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was written: IHESUS; the monogram contains the first and last letter of the Holy Name. It is first found on a gold coin of the eight century: DN IHS CHS REX REGNANTIUM (The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, King of Kings). Some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> say that the three letters are the initials of: "Jesus Hominum Salvator" (<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Saviour of Men). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> made this monogram the emblem of their Society, adding a cross over the H and three nails under it. Consequently a new explanation of the emblem was invented, pretending that the nails originally were a "V", and that the monogram stands for "In Hoc Signo Vinces" (In This Sign you shall Conquer), the words which, according to a legendary account, Constantine saw in the heavens under the Sign of the Cross before the battle at the Milvian bridge (312).

<p><a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> are said to have granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of thirty days to those who would add the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the Hail Mary or would bend their knees, or at least bow their heads when hearing the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (Alanus, "Psal. Christi et Mariae", i, 13, and iv, 25, 33; Michael ab Insulis, "Quodlibet", v; Colvenerius, "De festo SS. Nominis", x). This statement may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; yet it was only by the efforts of St. Bernardine that the custom of adding the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the Ave Maria was spread in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and from there to the Universal Church. But up to the sixteenth century it was still unknown in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (Colven., op. Cit., x), whilst in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the faithful still affix to the Ave Maria the words: "Jesus Christus" (ventris tui, Jesus Christus). <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (2 July, 1587) granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of fifty days to the ejaculation: "Praise be to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>!" with the answer: "For evermore", or "Amen". In the South of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the peasants salute each other with this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> formula. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of fifty days to all as often as they pronounce the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> reverently, and a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> in the hour of death. These two <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>, 5 Sept., 1759. As often as we invoke the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and Mary ("Jesu!", "Maria!") we may gain an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 300 days, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 10 Oct., 1904. It is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to gain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> in the hour of death, to pronounce at least in mind the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.
