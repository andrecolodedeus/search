<h1>Holy Oils</h1>  

<p>(OLEA SACRA).
<h2>Liturgical benediction</h2>

<p>Oil is a product of great utility the symbolic signification of which harmonizes with its natural uses. It serves to sweeten, to strengthen, to render supple; and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> employs it for these purposes in its rites. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> blessing of oil is very ancient. It is met with in the fourth century in the "Prayer Book of Serapion", and in the Apostolic Constitutions, also in a Syriac document of the fifth or sixth century entitles "Testamentum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi." The aforesaid book of Bishop Serapion (d. c. 362) contains the formula for the blessing of the oil and <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> for those who had just received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which was in those days followed by confirmation in such a manner that the administration of both <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> constituted a single <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. In the same book is found a separate form of blessing for the oil of the sick, for water, and for bread. It is an invocation to Christ to give His creatures power to cure the sick, to purify the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to drive away impure spirits, and to wipe out <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> oil was used for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and kings, also in all great <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions, e.g., <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, legal purifications, and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of altars (<a href="../bible/exo030.htm#vrs23">Exodus 30:23, 33</a>; <a href="../bible/exo039.htm#vrs27">39:27, 29</a>; <a href="../bible/exo011.htm#vrs9">11:9, 15</a>; <a href="../bible/lev006.htm#vrs15">Leviticus 6:15 sq.</a>)

<p>In the primitive Church the oils to be used in the initiation of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> in the <em>Missa Chrismalis.</em> Two different <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a> were used, one containing pure oil, the other oil mixed with balsam. This mixture, was made by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself before the Mass, in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. During the Mass two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of lesser rank stood before the altar holding the <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a>. Towards the end of the Canon the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were allowed to make use of themselves (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Ad Scap." iv.), but the same oil also served for extreme unction. The vessels holding it were placed on the railing surrounding the space reserved for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> brought some of these vessels to the altar to receive that blessing of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> which we read today in the Gelasian and Gregorian Sacramentaries. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> continued the mass while the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> returned the <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a> to the place whence they had brought them, and a certain number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> repeated over those which had not been brought to the altar the formula pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the large <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampullae</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and one of his assistants. The <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampulla</a> of perfumed oil, the pontiff breathed on it three times, made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, and recited a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which bears a certain resemblance to the Preface of the Mass. The <a href="../cathen/01439c.htm">ampulla</a> of pure oil was next presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with less solemnity. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and benediction of the holy oils now take place on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> at a very solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> reserved for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the oil which is to serve at the anointing of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> previous to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, next the oil with which the sick are annointed in the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, finally the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, which is a mixture of oil and balsam, and which is used in the administration of the Sacrament of Confirmation.
<h2>Oil of the sick</h2>

<p>The use of oil in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity was not, as has been maintained, a medical prescription adopted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In Apostolic times St. James directed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or ancients of the community to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the sick man and to anoint him with oil in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/jam005.htm#vrs14">James 5:14</a>). And shortly afterwards, probably in the second century, a gold leaf found at Beyrout, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, contains an <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a> "pronounced in the dwelling of him whom I annointed." This is, after the text of St. James, the earliest evidence of the use of oil accompained by a formula in the administration of a sacrament [see <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a> (d. 181), "Ad Autolyc." I, xii, in P.G. VI, 1042]. The oil of the sick might be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> not only by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of high repute for virtue, and even by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In the sixth century St. Monegundus on his death-bed blessed oil and salt which were afterwards used for the sick ("Vita S. Monegundi", ix, in "Acta SS. Ord. S. Bened." I, 204; <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, "Vita Patr." xix, 4). A similar instance is met with in the life of St. Radegund (Vita Radeg., I, xxxv). In the West, however, the tendency was early manifested to confine the blessing of the oil of the sick to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only; about 730 <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> ordered all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to have recourse to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Statut., xxiv). In 744 the tendency was not so pronounced in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but the Council of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> (813) imposed on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of anointing the sick with oil blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (can. xlviii). In the East the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> retained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the oil. The custom even became established, and has lasted to the present time, of having the oil blessed in the house of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or in the church, by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or, if possible, by seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
<h2>Oil of catechumens</h2>

<p>During the time of the catechumenate those who were about to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> received one or more anointings with holy oil. The oil used on this occasion was that which had received the blessing mentioned in the Apostolic Constitutions (VII, xlii). This anointing of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> is explained by the fact that they were regarded to a certain extent as being possessed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> until Christ should enter into them through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The oil of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> is also used in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of kings and queens.
<h2>Oil of chrism</h2>

<p>This is used in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> immediately after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; both in the East and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> it was used very early for the <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Sacrament of Confirmation</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">CHRISM</a>).
<h2>Oil in the <em>agnus dei</em></h2>

<p>The "Ordo Romanus" (c. 730) shows that in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> went very early to St. John Lateran, where he mixed wax and oil in a large vase, this mixture being used to make the Agnus Deis (Mabillon, "Mus. Ital.", II, 31.) The same document shows that in suburban churches wax was used while Pseudo-Aleuin (Divin. offic., xix) says that both wax and oil were used.
<h2>Oil in the Eucharistic bread</h2>

<p>In the Liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the Syrian <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, the elements presented at the Eucharistic Consecration have been prepared with oil. Among the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> a special <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> prescribes the use of flour, salt, olive oil, and water ("Officium Renovationis fermenti"; Matente, "De antiquis Eccles. ritib.", I, iii, 7; Badger, "Nestorians", II, 162; <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, "Explic. des prieres de la messe", dissert, xi, 9).
<h2>Oil in the font</h2>

<p>From the second century the custom was established of administering <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with water specially blessed for this purpose. Nevertheless, the sacrament was valid if ordinary water was used. We are not well informed as to the nature of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water, but it must be said that the most ancient indications and descriptions say nothing of the use of oil in this <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The first witness, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, does not go beyond the first half of the sixth century; he tells us that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> pours oil on the water of the fonts in the form of a cross (De hierarch, eccles., IV, x; cf. II, viii). There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this rite was introduced at a comparatively late period.
<h2>Oil in church lamps</h2>

<p>The maintenance of more or less numerous lamps in the churches was a source of expense which the faithful in their generosity hastened to meet by establishing a fund to purchase oil. The Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (572) decided that a third of the offerings made to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be used for purchasing oil for the light. The quantity of oil thus consumed was greater when the lamp burned before a famous <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> or shrine, in which case it was daily distributed to <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> it as a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> (Kraus, "Real-Encykl.", II, 522). (See <a href="../cathen/09244b.htm">LIGHTS</a>.)
