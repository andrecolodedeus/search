<h1>Holy Orders</h1>  

<p>Order is the appropriate disposition of things equal and unequal, by giving each its proper place (St. Augustine, <a href="../fathers/120119.htm"><em>City of God</em> XIX.13</a>). Order primarily means a relation. It is used to designate that on which the relation is founded and thus generally means rank (St. Thomas, <a href="../summa/5034.htm#article2">Supplement 34.2 ad 4um</a>). In this sense it was applied to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> (St. Jerome, "In Isaiam", XIX, 18; St. Gregory the Great, "Moral.", XXXII, xx). The meaning was restricted later to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> as a whole or to the various ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and some early writers had already used the word in that sense, but generally with a qualifying adjective (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0405.htm"><em>Exhortation to Chastity</em> 7</a>, ordo sacerdotalis, ordo ecclesiasticus; St. Gregory of Tours, "Vit. patr.", X, i, ordo clericorum). Order is used to signify not only the particular rank or general status of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but also the outward action by which they are raised to that status, and thus stands for ordination. It also indicates what differentiates <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or the various ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and thus means spiritual power. The Sacrament of Order is the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> by which grace and spiritual power for the discharge of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices are conferred.

<p>Christ founded His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> there must be the power of ruling; and also the principles by which the members are to attain their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, viz., <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is held by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is formally elevated to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. Thus, besides the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the power of teaching (<em>magisterium</em>) and the power of conferring grace (power of order). This power of order was committed by our Lord to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, who were to continue His work and to be His earthly representatives. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> received their power from Christ: "as the Father hath sent me, I also send you" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs21">John 20:21</a>). Christ possessed fullness of power in virtue of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>--of His office as Redeemer and Mediator. He merited the grace which freed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> from the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which grace is applied to man mediately by the Sacrifice of the Eucharist and immediately by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. He gave His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the power to offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a> (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs19">Luke 22:19</a>), and dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs18">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">John 20:22, 23</a>); thus making them <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> receives <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> which confers on him a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Even as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> under the Old dispensation was to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> kingdom" (<a href="../bible/exo019.htm#vrs4">Exodus 19:4-6</a>), thus under the New, all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are "a kingly <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>" (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs9">1 Peter 2:9</a>); but now as then the special and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> strengthens and perfects the universal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs3">2 Corinthians 3:3, 6</a>; <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs16">Romans 15:16</a>).
<h2>Sacrament of order</h2>

<p>From <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> we learn that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> appointed others by an external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> (imposition of hands), conferring inward grace. The fact that grace is ascribed immediately to the external rite, shows that Christ must have thus ordained. The fact that <em>cheirontonein, cheirotonia</em>, which meant <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">electing</a> by show of hands, had acquired the technical meaning of ordination by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> before the middle of the third century, shows that appointment to the various orders was made by that external rite. We read of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, how the Apostles "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposed hands</a> upon them" (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs6">Acts 6:6</a>). In <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs6">2 Timothy 1:6</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> reminds Timothy that he was made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> hands (cf. <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 4:4</a>), and <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a> is exhorted to appoint <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> by the same rite (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs22">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs3">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="../bible/act014.htm#vrs22">14:22</a>). In the <a href="../fathers/080803.htm">Third Clementine Homily (73)</a>, we read of the appointment of Zach&aelig;us as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the imposition of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> hands. The word is used in its technical meaning by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02106.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VI.13, 106</a>; cf. <a href="../fathers/07152.htm"><em>Apostolic Consitutions</em> II.32</a>). "A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> lays on hands, but does not ordain" (<em>cheirothetei ou cheirotonei</em>) "Didasc. Syr.", IV; III, 10, 11, 20; <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, "Ad Fabianum" in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>.

<p>Grace was attached to this external sign and conferred by it. "I admonish thee, that thou <em>stir up</em> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> which is in thee, through (<em>dia</em>) the imposition of my hands" (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs6">2 Timothy 1:6</a>). The context clearly shows that there is question here of a grace which enables Timothy to rightly discharge the office imposed upon him, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> continues "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not given us the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: but of power, and of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and of sobriety." This grace is something permanent, as appears from the words "that thou stir up the grace which is in thee"; we reach the same conclusion from <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs14">1 Timothy 4:14</a>, where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says, "Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, with (<em>meta</em>) <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>." This text shows that when St. Paul ordained Timothy, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> also laid their hands upon him, even as now the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who assist at ordination lay their hands on the candidate. St. Paul here exhorts Timothy to teach and command, to be an example to all. To neglect this would be to neglect the grace which is in him. This grace therefore enables him to teach and command, to discharge his office rightly. The grace then is not a charismatic <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for the rightful discharge of official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of Order has ever been recognized in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as such. This is attested by the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a special <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (cf. St. John Chrysostom, <a href="../fathers/1922.htm">"De sacerdotio"</a>; St. Gregory of Nyssa, <a href="../fathers/2910.htm">"Oratio in baptism. Christi"</a>), which requires a special ordination. St. Augustine, speaking about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and order, says, "Each is a sacrament, and each is given by a certain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, . . . If both are <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>, how is the one not lost (by defection from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) and the other lost?" (Contra. Epist. Parmen., ii, 28-30). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> says, "Whereas, by the testimony of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, by <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>, and by the unanimous consent of the Fathers, it is clear that grace is conferred by sacred ordination, which is performed by words and outward <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a>, no one ought to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Order is truly and properly one of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Seven Sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a>" (Sess. XXIII, c. iii, can. 3).


<h3>Number of orders</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, can. 3) <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that, besides the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, there are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> other orders, both major and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor</a>. Though nothing has been <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> with regard to the number of orders it is usually given as seven: <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, readers, and doorkeepers. The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is thus counted as including <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; if the latter be numbered separately we have eight; and if we add first <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, which was at one time regarded as an order, we have nine. We meet with different numberings in different Churches, and it would seem that <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> reasons influenced them to some extent (Mart&egrave;ne, "De antiq. eccl. rit.", I, viii, l, 1; <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Rit. orient.", II, 155). The "Statuta ecclesi&aelig; antiqua" enumerate nine orders, adding psalmists and counting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> separately. Others enumerate eight orders, thus, e.g. the author of "De divin. offic.", 33, and <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan's</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08566a.htm">Jumi&egrave;ges</a> pontificals (Mart&egrave;ne, I, viii, 11), the latter not counting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and adding <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">cantor</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, "De sacro alt. minister.", I, i, counts six orders, as do also the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> canons, where <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> were unknown. Besides the psalmista or <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">cantor</a>, several other functionaries seem to have been recognized as holding orders, e.g., <em>fossarii</em> (<em>fossores</em>) grave diggers, <em>hermeneutoe</em> (interpreters), <em>custodes martyrum</em> etc. Some consider them to have been real orders (Morin, "Comm. de sacris eccl. ordin.", III, Ex. 11, 7); but it is more probable that they were merely offices, generally committed to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De syn. dioc.", VIII, ix, 7, 8). In the East there is considerable variety of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> regarding the number of orders. The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> acknowledges five, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and readers. The same number is found in <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (Dial. contra manich&aelig;os, iii); in the ancient <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, and doorkeepers were probably considered only as offices (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Rit. orient.", I, 116).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> a distinction is made between major and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. In the East the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> is regarded as a <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a>, and it includes three of the other <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> (porter, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> are the major, or sacred, orders, so-called because they have immediate reference to what is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/5037.htm#article3">Supplement 37.3</a>). The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> orders strictly so-called are of divine origin (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIII, can. 6). We have seen that our Lord instituted a ministry in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, who received fullness of authority and power. One of the first exercises of this <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> power was the appointment of others to help and succeed them. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> did not confine their labors to any particular <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but, following the Divine command to make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they were the missionaries of the first generation. Others also are mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> as exercising an itinerant ministry, such as those who are in a wider sense called Apostles (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs7">Romans 16:7</a>), or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, teachers, and evangelists (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs11">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Side by side with this itinerant <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> provision is made for the ordinary ministrations by the appointment of local <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the ministry passed entirely when the itinerant <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> disappeared (see <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">DEACON</a>).

<p>Besides <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> others were appointed to the ministry, who are called <em>presbyteroi</em> and <em>episkopoi</em>. There is no record of their institution, but the names occur casually. Though some have explained the appointment of the seventy-two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in <a href="../bible/luk010.htm">Luke 10</a>, as the institution of the presbyterate, it is generally agreed that they had only a temporary appointment. We find <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the Mother Church at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, receiving the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">gifts</a> of the brethren of Antioch. They appear in close connection with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> sent forth the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which freed the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> from the burden of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a> (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs23">Acts 15:23</a>). In <a href="../bible/jam005.htm#vrs14">St. James (5:14-15)</a> they appear as performing <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> actions, and from St. Peter we learn that they are shepherds of the flock (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#vrs2">1 Peter 5:2</a>). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> hold a position of authority (<a href="../bible/phi000.htm">Philippians</a> 1; <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs7">Titus 1:7</a>) and have been appointed shepherds by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs28">Acts 20:28</a>). That the ministry of both was local appears from <a href="../bible/act014.htm#vrs23">Acts 14:23</a>, where we read that Paul and Barnabas appointed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the various Churches which they founded during their first missionary journey. It is shown also by the fact that they had to shepherd the flock, <em>wherein</em> they have been appointed, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> have to shepherd the flock, that is <em>amongst them</em> (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#vrs2">1 Peter 5:2</a>). Titus is left in Crete that he might appoint <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in every city (<em>kata eolin</em>, <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs5">Titus 1:5</a>; cf. Chrysostom, <a href="../fathers/23082.htm"><em>Homily 2 on Titus</em></a>).

<p>We cannot argue from the difference of names to the difference of official position, because the names are to some extent interchangeable (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs17">Acts 20:17, 28</a>; <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs6">Titus 1:6-7</a>). The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> does not clearly show the distinction between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and we must examine its evidence in the light of later times. Toward the end of the second century there is a universal and unquestioned <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their superior authority date from <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times (see <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">HIERARCHY OF THE EARLY CHURCH</a>). It throws much light on the New-Testament evidence and we find that what appears distinctly at the time of Ignatius can be traced through the <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">pastoral epistles</a> of St. Paul, to the very beginning of the history of the Mother Church at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08275b.htm">St. James</a>, the brother of the Lord, appears to occupy the position of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs17">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs13">15:13</a>; <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs18">21:18</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">Galatians 2:9</a>); Timothy and Titus possess full episcopal authority, and were ever thus recognized in tradition (cf. <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs5">Titus 1:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs19">1 Timothy 5:19 and 22</a>). No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there is much obscurity in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but this is accounted for by many reasons. The monuments of tradition never give us the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in all its fullness, and we cannot expect this fullness, with regard to the internal organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> existing in Apostolic times, from the cursory references in the occasional writings of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The position of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would necessarily be much less prominent than in later times. The supreme authority of the Apostles, the great number of charismatically <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifted</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the fact that various Churches were ruled by Apostolic delegates who exercised episcopal authority under Apostolic direction, would prevent that special prominence. The union between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> was close, and the names remained interchangeable long after the distinction between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was commonly recognized, e.g., in Irenaeus, <a href="../fathers/0103426.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> IV.26.2</a>. Hence it would seem that already, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, we find, obscurely no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the same ministry which appeared so distinctly afterwards.

<h4>Which of the Orders are sacramental?</h4>

<p>All agree that there is but one <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of Order, i.e., the totality of the power conferred by the sacrament is contained in the supreme order, whilst the others contain only part thereof (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/5037.htm#article1">Supplement 37.1 ad 2um</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> has never been denied by anyone who admitted the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of Order, and, though not explicitly <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a>, it follows immediately from the statements of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Thus (Sess. XXIII, can. 2), "If any one saith that besides the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> there are not in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> other orders, both major and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor</a>, by which as by certain steps, advance is made to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>." In the fourth chapter of the same session, after declaring that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of Order imprints a <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> "which can neither be effaced nor taken away; the holy synod with reason condemns the opinion of those who assert that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> have only a temporary power". The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is therefore a sacrament.

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> defines that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> belong to the divinely instituted <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, that they are superior to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and that they have the power of confirming and ordaining which is proper to them (Sess. XXIII, c. iv, can. 6, 7). The superiority of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is abundantly attested in <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>, and we have seen above that the distinction between <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is of Apostolic origin. Most of the older <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastics</a> were of opinion that the episcopate is not a sacrament; this opinion finds able defenders even now (e.g., Billot, "De sacramentis", II), though the majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> ordination is a sacrament. With regard to the <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of the other orders see <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">DEACONS</a>; <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">MINOR ORDERS</a>; <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">SUBDEACONS</a>.
<h3>Matter and form</h3>

<p>In the question of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of this sacrament we must distinguish between the three higher orders and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> having instituted the latter, also determines their <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. With regard to the former, the received opinion maintains that the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> is the sole <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. This has been undoubtedly used from the beginning; to it, exclusively and directly, the conferring of grace is ascribed by St. Paul and many Fathers and councils. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> used it exclusively for nine or ten centuries, and the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> to this day knows no other matter. Many <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have held that the tradition of the instruments was the sole matter even for the strictly <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> orders, but this position has long been universally abandoned. Other scholastics held that both <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the tradition of the instruments constitute the matter of the sacrament; this opinion still finds defenders. Appeal is made to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> spoke "of the integrating and accessory <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, which he wished <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> to add to the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, long since in use amongst them, that they might thus conform to the usage of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, and more firmly adhere to it, by uniformity of <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>" (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De syn. dioc.", VIII, x, 8). The real foundation of the latter opinion is the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with regard to the sacrament. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is argued, instituted the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of Order by instituting that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there should be an external rite, which would of its own <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> signify and confer the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power and corresponding grace. As Christ did not ordain His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, it would seem that He left to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the power of determining by which particular rite the power and grace should be conferred. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> determination of the particular rite would be the fulfilling of a <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> required in order that the Divine institution should take effect. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> determined the simple <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> for the East and added, in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the tradition of the instruments for the West--changing its symbolical language according as circumstances of place or time required.

<p>The question of the <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> of the sacrament naturally depends on that of the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. If the tradition of the instruments be taken as the total or partial matter, the words which accompany it will be taken as the form. If the simple <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> be considered the sole matter, the words which belong to it are the form. The form which accompanies the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> contains the words "Accipe spiritum sanctum", which in the ordination of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, however, are found with the second <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, towards the end of the Mass, but these words are not found in the old rituals nor in the Greek Euchology. Thus the form is not contained in these words, but in the longer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> accompanying the former <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, substantially the same from the beginning. All that we have said about the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form is speculative; in practice, whatever has been prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be followed, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this, as in other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, insists that anything omitted should be supplied.
<h3>Effect of the Sacrament</h3>

<p>The first effect of the sacrament is an increase of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. With this, there is the sacramental grace which makes the recipient a fit and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> minister in the discharge of his office. As the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are manifold and onerous, it is in perfect accord with the rulings of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's Providence</a> to confer a special grace on His <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> requires grace, and the rightful discharge of sacred offices presupposes a special degree of spiritual excellence. The external sacramental sign or the power of the order can be received and may exist without this grace. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a> is required for the worthy, not the valid, exercise of the power, which is immediately and inseparably connected with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> character. The principal effect of the sacrament is the character, a spiritual and indelible mark impressed upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by which the recipient is distinguished from others, designated as a minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and deputed and empowered to perform certain offices of Divine worship (<a href="../summa/4063.htm#article2">Summa III.63.2</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of order distinguishes the ordained from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. It gives the recipient in the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, e.g., the power to minister officially, in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the power to offer the Sacrifice and dispense the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a> the power to ordain new <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> defined the existence of a character (Sess. VII, can. 9). Its existence is shown especially by the fact that ordination like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, if ever valid, can never be repeated. Though there have been controversies with regard to the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the validity of ordination, and different views were held at different times in reference to them, "it has always been admitted that a valid ordination cannot be repeated. Reordinations do not suppose the negation of the inamissible character of Order--they presuppose an anterior ordination which was null. There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that mistakes were made regarding the nullity of the first ordination, but this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of fact leaves the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the initerability of ordination untouched" (Saltet, "Les R&eacute;ordinations", 392).
<h3>Minister</h3>

<p>The ordinary minister of the sacrament is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who alone has this power in virtue of his ordination. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> attributed the power to the Apostles and their <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs6">Acts 6:6</a>; <a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs22">16:22</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs22">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs6">2 Timothy 1:6</a>; <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs5">Titus 1:5</a>), and the Fathers and councils ascribe the power to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> exclusively. <a href="../fathers/3801.htm">First Council of Nicaea (Canon 4)</a> and <a href="../fathers/07158.htm">Apostolic Constitutions VIII.28</a> &#151; "A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lays on hands, ordains. . .a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> lays on hands, but does not ordain." A council held at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (340) declared the orders conferred by Caluthus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, null and void (Athanas., "Apol. contra Arianos", ii). For the custom said to have existed in the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> see <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">EGYPT</a>. Nor can objection be raised from the fact that <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a></em> are known to have ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that some <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a></em> were in <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> orders (Gillman, "Das Institut der Chorbisch&ouml;fe im Orient," <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1903; <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Conciles", II, 1197-1237). No one but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can give any orders now without a <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may be thus authorized to confer <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>. It is generally denied that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can confer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests'</a> orders, and history, certainly, records no instance of the exercise of such extraordinary ministry. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> cannot be conferred by a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, according to the majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. This is sometimes questioned, as <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> is said to have granted the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> to <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (1489), but the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">genuineness</a> of the concession is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. For lawful ordination the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, free from <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">censures</a>, and must observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> prescribed for ordination. He cannot lawfully ordain any except his own subjects without authorization (see below).
<h3>Subject</h3>

<p>Every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> male can validly receive ordination. Though in former times there were several semi-clerical ranks of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">DEACONESSES</a>), they were not admitted to orders properly so called and had no spiritual power. The first requisite for lawful ordination is a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">Divine vocation</a>; by which is understood the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby He selects some to be His special <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, endowing them with the spiritual, <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a>, and physical <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">qualities</a> required for the fitting discharge of their order and inspiring them with a sincere desire to enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and their own sanctification. The reality of this Divine call is manifested in general by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life, right faith, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> corresponding to the proper exercise of the order to which one is raised, absence of physical defects, the age required by the canons (see <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">IRREGULARITY</a>). Sometimes this call was manifested in an extraordinary manner (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs15">Acts 1:15</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs2">13:2</a>); in general, however, the "calling" was made according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded on the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Though <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> had a voice in the election of the candidates, the ultimate and definite determination rested with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The election of the candidates by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> was in the nature of a testimony of fitness, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had to personally ascertain the candidates' qualifications. A public inquiry was held regarding their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and moral character and the electors were consulted. Only such as were personally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">electing</a> congregation, i.e., members of the same Church, were chosen.

<p>A specified age was required, and, though there was some diversity in different places, in general, for <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> the age was twenty-five or thirty, for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> thirty or thirty-five, for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> thirty-five or forty or even fifty (<a href="../fathers/07152.htm">Apostolic Constitutions II.1</a>). Nor was physical age deemed sufficient, but there were prescribed specified periods of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, during which the ordained should remain in a particular degree. The different degrees were considered not merely as steps preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but as real church offices. In the beginning no such periods, called interstices, were appointed, though the tendency to orderly promotion is attested already in the pastoral Epistles (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 3:3, 16</a>). The first rules were apparently made in the fourth century. They seem to have been enforced by <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Siricius</a> (385) and somewhat modified by Zosimus (418), who <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> that the office of reader or <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> should last till the candidate was twenty, or for five years in case of those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as adults; four years were to be spent as <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> or <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, five years as <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. This was modified by <a href="../cathen/06407a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> (492), according to whom a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who had been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> might be ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after one year, thus allowing three months to elapse between each ordination, and a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who had not been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> might be ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after eighteen months. At present the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> are generally conferred together on one day.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who are the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the sacrament ex officio, must inquire about the birth, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, age, title, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> character of the candidate. They must examine whether he is born of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and is spiritually, intellectually, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morally</a>, and physically fit for the exercise of the ministry. The age required by the canons is for <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> twenty-one, for <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> twenty-two, and for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> twenty-four years completed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may dispense from any <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> generally receive some power of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> also with regard to age, not usually for <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, but for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> can generally dispense for one year, whilst the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gives <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for over a year; a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for more than eighteen months is but very rarely granted. For admission to <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, the testimony from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or from the master of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> where the candidate was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>--generally, therefore, the superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>--is required. For major orders further inquiries must be made. The names of the candidate must be published in the place of his birth and of his <a href="../cathen/05103b.htm">domicile</a> and the result of such inquiries are to be forwarded to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. No <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may ordain those not belonging to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by reason of birth, domicile, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, or <em>familiaritas</em>, without <a href="../cathen/04797b.htm">dimissorial letters</a> from the candidate's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Testimonial letters are also required from all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the candidate has resided for over six months, after the age of seven. Transgression of this rule is punished by <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em> against the ordaining <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In recent years several decisions insist on the strict interpretation of these rules. <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">Subdeacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should pass one full year in these orders and they may then proceed to receive the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. This is laid down by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, c.xi.), which did not prescribe the time for <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> generally has the power to dispense from these interstices, but it is absolutely forbidden, unless a special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> be obtained, to receive two major orders or the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> in one day.

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> and the higher orders there is, moreover, required a title, i.e., the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive maintenance from a determined source. Again, the candidate must observe the interstices, or times required to elapse between the reception of various orders; he must also have received <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> and the lower orders preceding the one to which he is raised. This last requirement does not affect the validity of the order conferred, as every order gives a distinct and independent power. One exception is made by the majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists, who are of opinion that episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> requires the previous reception of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders for its validity. Others, however, maintain that episcopal power includes full <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, which is thus conferred by episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. They appeal to history and bring forward cases of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without having previously received <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders, and though most of the cases are somewhat <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> and can be explained on other grounds, it seems impossible to reject them all. It is further to be remembered that <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> mostly required the previous reception of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders for valid episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, because they did not consider <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> an order, a view which is now generally abandoned.
<h3>Obligations</h3>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> attached to holy Orders see <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a>; <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">CELIBACY OF THE CLERGY</a>.
<h3>Ceremonies of ordination</h3>

<p>From the beginning the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and episcopate were conferred with special <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>. Though in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> there was considerable development and diversity in different parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were always and universally employed and date from <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs6">Acts 6:6</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs3">13:3</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs14">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs6">2 Timothy 1:6</a>). In the early <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> these sacred orders were conferred amid a great concourse of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people at a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> station. The candidates, who had been previously presented to the people, were summoned by name at the beginning of the solemn Mass. They were placed in a conspicuous position, and anyone objecting to a candidate was called upon to state his objections without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Silence was regarded as approval. Shortly before the Gospel, after the candidates were presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the entire congregation was invited to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. All prostrating, the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> were recited, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposed his hands</a> upon the head of each candidate and recited the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a> with a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> corresponding to the order conferred. The <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> was somewhat more elaborate. Besides the ceremonies used in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, the people approving the candidates by acclamation, the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and the head and hands of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were anointed with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a>. After the seventh century the tradition of the instruments of office was added, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> and <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, stole and planeta to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a> and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">staff</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, after the presentation of the candidate to the congregation and their shout of approval, "He is worthy", the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposed his hands</a> upon the candidate and said the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrating</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.

<p>We now give a short description of the ordination rite for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as found in the present Roman <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">Pontifical</a>. All the candidates should present themselves in the church with <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and in <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> dress, carrying the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> of the order to which they are to be raised, and lighted <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a>. They are all summoned by name, each candidate answering "Adsum". When a general ordination takes place the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is given after the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> or Kyrie, the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> after the Gloria, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> after the <a href="../cathen/04103a.htm">Collect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> after the Epistle, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> after <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> and Tract. After the Tract of the Mass the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> summons all who are to receive the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The candidates, vested in <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, girdle, <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, with folded <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> on left arm and a <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a> in their right hand, go forward and <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneel</a> around the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The latter inquires of the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, who is here the representative of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as it were, whether the candidates are worthy to be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> answers in the affirmative and his testimony represents the testimony of fitness given in ancient times by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, then charging the congregation and insisting upon the reasons why "the Fathers decreed that the people also should be consulted", asks that, if anyone has anything to say to the prejudice of the candidates, he should come forward and state it.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then instructs and admonishes the candidates as to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their new office. He kneels down in front of the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>; the <em>ordinandi</em> lay themselves prostrate on the carpet, and the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a> is <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chanted</a> or recited. On the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">Litany</a>, all arise, the candidates come forward, and <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneel</a> in pairs before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> while he lays both hands on the head of each candidate in silence. The same is done by all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are present. Whilst <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> keep their right hands extended, the former alone recites a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, inviting all to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for a <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on the candidates. After this follows the Collect and then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> says the <a href="../cathen/12384a.htm">Preface</a>, towards the end of which occurs the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "Grant, we beseech Thee etc." The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then with appropriate formul&aelig; crosses the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> over the breast of each one and vests him with the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>. This is arranged to hang down in front but is folded behind. Though there is no mention of the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> in many of the most ancient Pontificals, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of its antiquity. The vesting with the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> is also very ancient and found already in <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> "Ord. VIII and IX." Afterwards the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> recites a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> calling down <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> blessing on the newly-ordained. He then intones the <a href="../cathen/15341a.htm">"Veni Creator"</a>, and whilst it is being sung by the choir he anoints the hands of each with the oil of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the head also was anointed in ancient times. The anointing of the hands, which in ancient times was done with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, or oil and <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, was not used by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, said <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> (A.D. 864), though it is generally found in all ancient ordinals. It probably became a general practice in the ninth century and seems to have been derived from the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Church (Haddan and Stubbs, "Councils and Eccl. Documents", I, 141). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then hands to each the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, containing <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> and water, with a <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and a host upon it. This rite, with its corresponding formula, which as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugo of St. Victor</a> says ("Sacr.", III, xii), signifies the power which has already been received, is not found in the oldest rituals and probably dates back not earlier than the ninth or tenth century. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has finished the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass, he seats himself before the middle of the altar and each of those ordained make an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> to him of a lighted <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a>. The newly-ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then repeat the Mass with him, all saying the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> simultaneously. Before the Communion the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> to one of the newly-ordained. After the Communion the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> again approach the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and say the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostle's Creed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> laying his hands upon each says: "Receive ye the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive they are forgiven them; and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain, they are retained." This <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> was introduced in the thirteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> is then folded, the newly-ordained make a promise of obedience and having received the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, return to their place.
<h3>Time and place</h3>

<p>During the first centuries ordination took place whenever demanded by the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> generally ordained in December (Amalarius, "De offic.", II, i). <a href="../cathen/06407a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> (494) decreed that the ordination of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> should be held at fixed times and days, viz., on the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the fourth, seventh, and tenth months, also on the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the beginning and midweek (<a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a>) of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">(holy) Saturday</a> about sunset (Epist. ad ep. Luc., xi). This but confirmed what <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> laid down, for he seems to speak of ordination on Ember Saturdays as an <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a> (Serm. 2, de jejun. Pentec.) The ordination may take place either after sunset on the Saturday or early on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> morning. The ordination to major orders took place before the Gospel.

<p>Minor orders might be given at any day or hour. They were generally given after <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">holy communion</a>. At present <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> may be given on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> (suppressed included) in the morning. For the sacred orders, a <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> to ordain on other days than those appointed by the canons, provided the ordination takes place on Sunday or day of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> (suppressed days included), is very commonly given. Though it was always the rule that ordinations should take place in public, in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they were sometimes held in private buildings. The place of ordinations is the church. Minor orders may be conferred in any place, but it is understood that they are given in the church. The <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">Pontifical</a> directs that ordinations to sacred orders must be held publicly in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> in presence of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, or if they be held in some other place, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should be present and the principle church, as far as possible, must be made use of (cf. Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIII, c. vii). (See <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">SUBDEACON</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">DEACONS</a>, <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">HIERARCHY</a>, <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">MINOR ORDERS</a>, <a href="../cathen/01312b.htm">ALIMENTATION</a>).
