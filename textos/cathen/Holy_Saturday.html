<h1>Holy Saturday</h1>  

<p>In the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Holy Saturday was known as Great, or Grand, Saturday, Holy Saturday, the Angelic Night, the Vigil of Easter, etc. It is no longer, like <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, a day of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but one of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness intermingled; it is the close of the season of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>, and the beginning of <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">paschal time</a>, which is one of rejoicing.

<p>By a noteworthy exception, in the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> this was the only Saturday on which <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> was permitted (Constit. Apost., VII, 23), and the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> was one of special severity. Dating from the time of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a>, an absolute <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> from every kind of food was observed for the forty hours preceding the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">feast of Easter</a>, and although the moment assigned for breaking the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> at dawn on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> varied according to time and country, the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">abstinence from food</a> on Holy Saturday was general.

<p>The night of the vigil of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> has undergone a strange displacement. During the first six or seven centuries, ceremonies were in progress throughout the entire night, so that the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> coincided with the day and moment of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. In the eighth century these same ceremonies were held on Saturday afternoon and, by a singular anachronism, were later on conducted on Saturday morning, thus the time for carrying out the solemnity was advanced almost a whole day. Thanks to this change, special services were now assigned to Holy Saturday whereas, beforehand, it had had none until the late hour of the vigil.

<p>This vigil opened with the blessing of the new fire, the lighting of lamps and candles and of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a>, ceremonies that have lost much of their symbolism by being anticipated and advanced from twilight to broad daylight. <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> spoke of this night that was as bright as day, and <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> added unprecedented splendour to its brilliancy by a profusion of lamps and enormous torches, so that not only <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, but private houses, streets, and public squares were resplendent with the light that was symbolic of the Risen Christ. The assembled <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> gave themselves up to common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the singing of psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and the reading of the Scriptures commentated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The vigil of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> was especially devoted to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who, in the more important churches, were very numerous. On the Holy Saturday following the deposition of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> from the See of Constantinople, there were 3000 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> in this church alone. Such numbers were, of course, only encountered in large cities; nevertheless, as Holy Saturday and the vigil of <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a> were the only days on which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was administered, even in smaller churches there was always a goodly number of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. This meeting of people in the darkness of the night often occasioned abuses which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> felt powerless to prevent by active supervision unless by so anticipating the ceremonies that all of them could take place in daylight. <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer of the ninth century (De cleric. Instit., II, 28), gives a detailed account of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of Holy Saturday. The congregation remained silent in the church awaiting the dawn of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, joining at intervals in psalmody and chant and listening to the reading of the lessons. These rites were identical with those in the primitive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and were solemnized at the same hours, as the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> throughout the world had not yet consented to anticipate the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> vigil and it was only during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> that uniformity on this point was established.
