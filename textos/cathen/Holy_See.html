<h1>Holy See</h1>  

<p>(From the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Sancta Sedes</em>, Holy Chair).

<p>A term derived from the <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronement</a>-ceremony of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The seat or chair in question must not be confounded with the ancient <em>sedes gestatoria</em> in the centre of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of St. Peter's, and immemorially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as the <em>cathedra Petri</em>, or Chair of Peter; the term means, in a general sense, the actual seat (i.e. residence) of the supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, together with the various <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> who constitute the central administration.

<p>In this canonical and diplomatic sense, the term is synonymous with <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">"Apostolic See"</a>, "Holy Apostolic See", "Roman Church", <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">"Roman Curia"</a>.The origin of these terms can only be approximately ascertained. The word <em>sedes</em>, "chair", is an old technical term applicable to all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. It was first used to designate the Churches founded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>; later the word was applied to the principal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a>. These <em>ecclesiae dictae majores</em> were understood to be the five great patriarchal sees of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity: <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and Constantinople. To these the word <em>sedes</em> was applied: "quod in iis episcopi sederent in thronis", and of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it was expressly said: "Romana quidem erat prima sedes propria dicta." Thus, Gelasius I (492-496) at a Roman council: "Est ergo prima Petri apostoli sedes." In the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">earliest Christian writings</a>, also, we often find references to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> or chair of Peter: "Sedet in cathedra Petri". Throughout the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the term was constantly in official use. Thus, in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, II, Paris, 1892, 7), under <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> (795-816): "Nos sedem apostolicam, quae est caput omnium Dei ecclesiarum, judicare non audemus." (We dare not judge the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which is the head of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches of God</a>.) We can thus readily understand how <em>Holy See</em> came be the technical term for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the central <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government, and the actual abode of the same.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> reservations of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, customary in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, made <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> a more exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the location of the "Holy See", e.g. when the incumbent of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> happened to die "apud sanctam sedem". Where was the "Holy See", when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> lived apart from the ordinary central administration? From the thirteenth to the fifteenth century we find no satisfactory solution of this question, and can only observe the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> in individual cases. Thus, it was not deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should reside in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: "Ubi Papa, ibi Curia", i.e., it was taken for granted that the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> or machinery of administration always followed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This is clearly shown by an interesting case under <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, who lived at Soriano from 8 June, 1280, till his death on 22 August of the same year. There were with him only his personal attendants, and the officials in charge of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> seal (<em>bullatores</em>). The <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, properly speaking, was at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, whither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> frequently went to transact affairs, and where he also gave audiences: "Audientiam suam fecit." Nevertheless, he ordered <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> to be dated from Soriano, which was done (Baumgarten, "Aus K. und Kammer", Freiburg, 1907, 279). More than a century later, as appears from the official rules drawn up under <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (Pedro de Luna; rules 148, 151, 158) and <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> (rule 68), this important point was still undecided. The aforesaid rules of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> appeared on 28 November, 1404, and 5 June, 1413, respectively (Von Ottenthal, "Die papstlichen Kanzleiregeln von Johann XXII bis Nikolaus V", Innsbruck, 1888, pp. 148, 151, 152, and 185). During the journey of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1417-1431) from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it frequently occurred that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> were separated from each other; even at this late date the official location of the "Holy See", in as far as this was legally important, was not yet authoritatively fixed. This uncertainty, says Bangen, caused <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> to draw up the Constitution: "Cum ob nonnullas", in which it is laid down that, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the pontifical administration should not reside in the same place, the utterances of both are authoritative, provided they are in agreement with each other. Covarruvias and Gonzalez agree that: "Curia Romana ibi censetur esse, ubi est papa cum cancellaria et tribunalibus et officialibus suis, quos ad regimen ecclesiae adhibet" (the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> is considered to be where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is, with the chancery, tribunals, and officials whom he employs in the Government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>). (Bangen, "Die r&ouml;mische Kurie", M&uuml;nster, 1854, I, i, 5). Hinschius (System des katholischen Kirchenrechts, III, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1883, 135, remark 6) follows the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> opinion: "Ubi Papa, ibi <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>"; but this seems no longer tenable.
