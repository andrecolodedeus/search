<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Holy Year of Jubilee</h1>  

<p>The ultimate derivation of the word <em>jubilee</em> is disputed, but it is most probable that the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>jobel</em>, to which it is traced, meant "a ram's horn", and that from this instrument, used in proclaiming the celebration, a certain <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of rejoicing was derived. Further, passing through the Greek <em>iobelaios</em>, or <em>iobelos</em>, the word became confused with the Latin <em>jubilo</em>, which means "to shout", and has given us the forms <em>jubilatio</em> and <em>jubilaeum</em>, now adopted in most <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages.
<h2>Old Testament origins</h2>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08534a.htm">H<font size=-2>EBREW</font> Y<font size=-2>EAR OF</font> J<font size=-2>UBILEE</font></a>), the year of Jubilee was in any case preeminently a time of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, the year of remission or universal pardon. "Thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year," we read in Leviticus 25:10, "and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the year of jubilee." Every seventh year, like every seventh day, was always accounted holy and set aside for rest, but the year which followed seven complete cycles was to be kept as a <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">sabbatical year</a> of special solemnity. The Talmudists and others afterwards disputed whether the Jubilee Year was the forty-ninth or the fiftieth year, the difficulty being that in the latter case two <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">sabbatical years</a> must have been observed in succession. Further, there are historical data which seem to show that in the age of the Machabees the Jubilee of the fiftieth year could not have been kept, for 164-163 B.C. and 38-37 B.C. were both certainly <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">sabbatical years</a>, which they could not have been if two <a href="../cathen/13289a.htm">sabbatical years</a> had been intercalated in the interval. However, the text of Leviticus (25:8-55) leaves no room for ambiguity that the fiftieth year was intended, and the institution evidently bore a close analogy with the <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">feast of Pentecost</a>, which was the closing day after seven weeks of harvest. In any case it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Jubilee period, as it was generally understood and adopted afterwards in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, meant fifty and not forty-nine years; but at the same time the number fifty was not originally arrived at because it represented half a century, but because it was the number that followed seven cycles of seven.

<p>It was, then, part of the legislation of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, whether practically adhered to or not, that each fiftieth year was to be celebrated as a jubilee year, and that at this season every household should recover its absent members, the land return to its former owners, the Hebrew slaves be set free, and <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> be remitted.
<h2>The Christian jubilee</h2>

<p>The same conception, spiritualized, forms the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Jubilee, though it is difficult to judge how far any sort of continuity can have existed between the two. It is commonly stated that <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a> instituted the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Jubilee in the year 1300, and it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that this is the first celebration of which we have any precise record, but it is also certain that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of solemnizing a fiftieth anniversary was familiar to <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> through their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a>, long before that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. The jubilee of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> was often kept, and probably some vague memory survived of those Roman <em>ludi saeculares</em> which are commemorated in the "Carmen Saeculare" of Horace, even though this last was commonly associated with a period of a hundred years rather than any lesser interval. But, what is most noteworthy, the number fifty was specially associated in the early thirteenth century with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of remission. The translation of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> took place in the year 1220, fifty years after his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The sermon on that occasion was preached by Stephen Cardinal Lantron, who told his hearers that this accident was meant by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence</a> to recall "the mystical virtue of the number fifty, which, as every reader of the sacred page is aware, is the number of remission" (P.L., CXC, 421).

<p>We might be tempted to regard this discourse as a fabrication of later date, were it not for the fact that a Latin <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> directed against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, and certainly belonging to the early thirteenth century, speaks in exactly similar terms. The first stanza runs thus: <blockquote>Anni favor jubilaei <br>Poenarum laxat debitum, <br>Post peccatorum vomitum <br>Et cessandi propositum. <br>Currant passim omnes rei. <br>Pro mercede regnum Dei <br>Levi patet expositum. </blockquote>

<p>In the light of this explicit mention of a jubilee with great remissions of the penalties of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be obtained by full confession and purpose of amendment, it seems difficult to reject the statement of <a href="../cathen/14284a.htm">Cardinal Stefaneschi</a>, the contemporary and counsellor of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and author of a treatise on the first Jubilee ("De Anno Jubileo" in <a href="../cathen/02566a.htm">La Bigne</a>, "Bibliotheca Patrum", VI, 536), that the proclamation of the Jubilee owed its origin to the statements of certain aged <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who persuaded <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> that great <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> had been granted to all <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about a hundred years before. It is also noteworthy that in the Chronicle of Alberic of Three Fountains, under the year 1208 (not, be it noted 1200), we find this brief entry: "It is said that this year was celebrated as the fiftieth year, or the year of jubilee and remission, in the Roman Court" (Pertz, "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script." XXIII, 889). It is beyond all dispute that on 22 February, 1300, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> published the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Antiquorum fida relatio", in which, appealing vaguely the precedent of past ages, he declares that he grants afresh and renews certain "great remissions and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" which are to be obtained "by visiting the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the venerable basilica of the Prince of the Apostles". Coming to more precise detail, he specifies that he concedes "not only full and copious, but the most full, pardon of all their sins", to those who fulfill certain conditions. These are, first, that being truly penitent they confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and secondly, that they visit the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at least once a day for a specified time--in the case of the inhabitants for thirty days, in the case of strangers for fifteen. No explicit mention is made of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Communion</a>, nor does the word <em>jubilee</em> occur in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>--indeed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> speaks rather of a celebration which is to occur every hundred years--but writers both Roman and foreign described this year as <em>annus jubileus</em>, and the name <em>jubilee</em> (though others, such as the "holy year" or "the golden year" have been used as well) has been applied to such celebrations ever since. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, who is himself supposed by some to have visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during this year to gain the Jubilee, refers to it under the name <em>Giubbileo</em> in the Inferno (xviii, 29) and indirectly bears witness to the enormous concourse of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> by comparing the sinners passing along one of the bridges of Malebolge in opposite directions, to the throngs crossing the bridge of the Castle Sant' Angelo on their way to and from St. Peter's. Similarly, the chronicler <a href="../cathen/15429b.htm">Villani</a> was so impressed on this occasion by the sight of the monuments of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the people who flocked thither that he then and there formed the resolution of his great chronicle, in the course of which he gives a remarkable account of what he witnessed. He describes the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> as a full and entire remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <em>di culpa e di pena</em>, and he dwells upon the great contentment and good order of the people, despite the fact that during the greater part of that year there were two hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> on an average present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> over and above the ordinary population. With regard to the phrase just noticed, <em>a culpa et a poena</em>, which was often popularly used of the Jubilee and other similar <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, it should be observed that it means no more than what is now understood by a "plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>". It implied, however, that any approved Roman confessor had faculties to absolve from <a href="../cathen/12785a.htm">reserved cases</a>, and that the liberty thus virtually accorded of selecting a confessor was regarded as a privilege. The phrase was an unscientific one, and was not commonly used by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. It certainly did not mean, as some have pretended, that the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of itself released from guilt as well as penalty. The guilt was remitted only in virtue of sacramental confession and the sorrow of the penitent. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> never claimed any power of absolving in grievous matters apart from these. "All theologians", remarks <a href="../cathen/09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a> with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, "unanimously without a single exception, reply that an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is not a remission of guilt but of the penalty." (See Paulus in "Zeitschrift f. kath. Theologie", 1899, pp. 49 sqq., 423 sqq., 743 sqq., and "Dublin Review", Jan., 1900, pp. 1 sqq.)


<h3>The jubilee of 1350</h3>

<p>As we have seen, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> had intended that the Jubilee should be celebrated only once in a hundred years, but some time before the middle of the fourteenth century, great instances, in which <a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St. Bridget of Sweden</a> and the poet <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> amongst others had some share, were made to <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a>, then residing at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, to anticipate this term, particularly on the ground that the average span of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> was so short as otherwise to render it impossible for many to hope to see any Jubilee in their own generation. <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> assented, and in 1350 accordingly, though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> himself. Gaetani Cardinal Ceccano was dispatched thither to represent His Holiness at the Jubilee. On this occasion daily visits to the church of <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">St. John Lateran</a> were enjoined, besides those to the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul without the walls</a>, while at the next Jubilee, St. Mary Major was added to the list. The visit to these four churches has remained unchanged ever since as one of the primary conditions for gaining the Roman Jubilee.
<h3>The jubilees of 1390 and 1423</h3>

<p>The celebration next following was held in 1390, and in virtue of an ordinance of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, it was proposed to hold a Jubilee every thirty-three years as representing the period of the sojourn of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> upon earth and also the average span of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>.

<p>Another Jubilee was accordingly proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> in 1423, but <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, in 1450, reverted to the <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">quinquagesimal period</a>, while <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> decreed that the Jubilee should be celebrated every twenty-five years, and this has been the normal rule ever since.
<h3>Subsequent jubilees</h3>

<p>The Jubilees of 1450 and 1475 were attended by vast crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and that of 1450 was unfortunately made famous by a terrible accident in which nearly two hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were trampled to death in a panic which occurred on the bridge of Sant' Angelo. But even this disaster had its good effects in the pains taken afterwards to widen the thoroughfares and to provide for the entertainment and comfort of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> by numerous charitable organizations, of which the Archconfraternity of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, was the most famous.

<p>On the other hand, it is impossible to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the evidence of innumerable witnesses as to the great moral renovation produced by these celebrations. The testimony comes in many cases from the most unexceptionable sources, and it extends from the days of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> to the striking account given by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> ("Last Four Popes", pp. 270, 271) of the only Jubilee held in the nineteenth century, that of 1825. The omission of the Jubilees of 1800, 1850, and 1875 was due to political disturbances, but with these exceptions the celebration has been uniformly maintained every twenty-five years from 1450 until the present time. The Jubilee of 1900, though shorn of much of its splendour by the confinement of the Holy Father within the limits of the Vatican, was, nevertheless carried out by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> with all the solemnity that was possible.
<h2>Ceremonial of the jubilee</h2>

<p>The most distinctive feature in the ceremonial of the Jubilee is the unwalling and the final walling up of the "holy door" in each of the four great <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> are required to visit. It was formerly supposed that this rite was instituted by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> in the Jubilee of 1500, but this is certainly a mistake. Not to speak of a supposed <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> as early as 1350, who is said to have been supernaturally admonished to "open the door", we have several references to the "holy door" or the "golden gate" in connection with the Jubilee long before the year 1475. The earliest account seems to be that of the Spanish pilgrim, Pero Tafur, c. 1437. He connects the Jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> with the right of sanctuary, which, he maintains, existed in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times for all who crossed the threshold of the <em>puerta tarpea</em> upon the site of the Lateran. He goes on to say that, at the request of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a>, Pope Sylvester published a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> proclaiming the same immunity from punishment for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sinners who took sanctuary there. The privilege, however, was grossly abused and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> consequently ordered the door to be walled up at all seasons save certain times of special grace. Formerly the door was unwalled only once in a hundred years, this was afterwards reduced to fifty, and now it is said to be "opened at the will of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>." However legendary all this may be, it is hardly possible that the story could have been quite recently fabricated at the time Tafur recorded it. Moreover, a number of witnesses allude to the unwalling of the holy door in connection with the Jubilee of 1450. One of these, the Florentine merchant Giovanni Rucellai, speaks of the five doors of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>, <blockquote> one of which is always walled up except during the Jubilee year, when it is broken down at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> when the Jubilee commences. The devotion which the populace has for the bricks and mortar of which it is composed is such that at the unwalling, the fragments are immediately carried off by the crowd, and the foreigners (<em>gli oltremontani</em>) take them home as so many <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a>. . . . Out of devotion every one who gains the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> passes through that door, which is walled up again as soon as the Jubilee is ended. (Archivio di Storia Patria, IV, 569-570) </blockquote>

<p>All this describes a rite which has lasted unchanged to the present day, and which has nearly always supplied the principal subject depicted upon the long series of Jubilee medals issued by the various <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who have opened and closed the holy door at the beginning and end of each Jubilee year. Each of the four <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> has its holy door. That of St. Peter's is opened on the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> preceding the <em>anno santo</em> by the pontiff in person, and it is closed by him on the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> following. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> knocks upon the door three times with a silver hammer, singing the versicle "Open unto me the gates of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>". The masonry, which has been loosened beforehand, is made to fall in at the third blow, and, after the threshhold has been swept and washed by the Jubilee penitentiaries, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> enters first. Each of the holy doors at the other <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> is similarly opened by a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> specially deputed for the purpose. The symbolism of this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is probably closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> from <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, and the expulsion and reconciliation of penitents according to the ritual provided in the <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">Pontifical</a>. But it may also have been influenced by the old <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of seeking sanctuary, as Tafur and Rucellai suggest. The sanctuary knocker of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> still remains to remind us of the important part which this institution played in the life of our forefathers.
<h2>The jubilee indulgence</h2>

<p>This is a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> which, as stated by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a>, it is the intention of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to grant in the most ample manner possible. Of course, when first conceded, such an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, and also the privilege annexed of choosing a confessor who had power to absolve from reserved cases, was a much rarer spiritual boon than it has since become. So preeminent was the favour then regarded that the custom arose of suspending all other <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> during the Jubilee year, a practice which, with certain modifications, still obtains at the present day. The precise conditions for gaining each Jubilee are determined by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, and they are usually announced in a special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, distinct from that which it is customary to issue on the preceding <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">feast of the Ascension</a> giving notice of the forthcoming celebration. The main conditions, however, which do not usually vary, are three: confession, Communion and visits to the four <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> during a certain specified period. The statement made by some, that the Jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, being <em>a culpa et a paena</em>, did not of old presuppose either confession or repentance, is absolutely without foundation, and is contradicted by every official document preserved to us. Besides the ordinary Jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, to be gained only by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who pay a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or through special concession by certain <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> religious confined within their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, it has long been customary to extend this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> the following year to the faithful throughout the world. For this fresh conditions are appointed, usually including a certain number of visits to local churches and sometimes <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. Further, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have constantly exercised their prerogative of conceding to all the faithful <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> <em>ad instar jubilaei</em> (after the model of a jubilee) which are commonly known as "extraordinary Jubilees". On these occasions, as at the Jubilee itself, special facilities are usually accorded for <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from reserved cases, though on the other hand, the great <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is only to be gained by the performance of conditions much more onerous than those required for an ordinary plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. Such extraordinary Jubilees are commonly granted by a newly elected pontiff at his accession or on occasions of some unwonted celebration, as was done, for example, at the convening of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, or again at times of great calamity.
