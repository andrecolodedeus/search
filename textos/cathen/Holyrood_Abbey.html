<h1>Holyrood Abbey</h1>  

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>; founded in 1128 by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> I for the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>, probably brought from St. Andrews. The foundation is said to have been an act of thanksgiving for the kings <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> escape from the horns of a hart, whilst hunting near Edinburgh on Holy Cross day. In the church was preserved, in a golden <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>, the fragment of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> brought by David's mother, St. Margaret, from <a href="../cathen/15545a.htm">Waltham Abbey</a>, and known thereafter as the Black Rood of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. At the battle of Neville's Cross, in 1346, this precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> fell into the hands of the English, and was placed in Durham Cathedral, whence it disappeared at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Holyrood was Alwyn, the king's confessor, who resigned the abbacy about 1150. A seal of his, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1141, and representing a cruciform church is preserved among the Newbottle Charters. The twenty-ninth and last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was Robert, a natural son of James V, who turned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> in 1559, married, and exchanged his abbacy with Adam, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Orkney, for the temporalities of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Adam resigned the abbacy in 1581 to his John (afterwards created Lord Holyroodhouse), the last who bore the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Among the chief benefactors of Holyrood during the four centuries of its existence as a religious house were Kings David I and II; Robert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Andrews; and Fergus, Lord of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>. Twice during the fourteenth century the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> suffered from the invasion of English kings: the army of Edward II plundered it in 1322, and it was burnt in 1305 by Richard II, but soon restored.

<p>King James I's twin sons, of whom the younger succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as James II, were born within the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1430, and Mary of Gueldres, queen of James II, was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church in 1449. Twenty years later James III was married there to Margaret of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. From the middle of the fifteenth century the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was the usual residence of the Scottish kings, and James V spent considerable sums on its repair and enlargement. In 1547 the conventual buildings, as well as the choir, lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> of the church were destroyed by the commissioners of the English Protector Somerset, and twenty years later <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox's</a> "rascal multitude" sacked the interior of the church. <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary's</a> second and third marriages took place at Holyrood, as well as other tragic events of her reign. From the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to the Restoration little was done to Holyrood, but about 1670 the adjoining palace was practically rebuilt by Charles II. His <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> successor, James II, ordered the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church to be restored for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, and as a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for the Knights of the Thistle; but he had to abandon his kingdom a year later. The <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> roof was vaulted in stone in 1758, but fell in shortly afterwards, and all that remains of the once famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church is now the ruined and roofless <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, of the purest Early English architecture, with some remains of the earlier Norman work.
