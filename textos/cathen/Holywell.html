<h1>Holywell</h1>  

<p>A town in North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, situated on the declivity of a hill overlooking a picturesque valley, through which flows a broad stream, the effluent from <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride's</a> Well, joining the River Dee at a distance of two miles from the town. It was once a flourishing place because of the lead and copper mines in its vicinity, but with the decay of the mining industry its commercial glory has fled, and at present the only attraction to visitors is <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> well.
<h2 id="section1">The miraculous well</h2>

<p>For more than a thousand years this well has attracted numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Two documents of the twelfth century, preserved in the British Museum, and printed by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, give us its history, with the earliest record of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures effected by its waters. These ancient cures included cases of dropsy, paralysis, gout, melancholia, sciatica, cancer, alienation of mind, blood spitting, obstinate cough, chronic pain and fluxion of the bowels, also deliverance from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>. The concourse of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the well continued in the sixteenth century during the days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">Dr. Thomas Goldwell</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, who went into exile at the accession of Elizabeth, obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> the confirmation of certain <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1417-31) to <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who visited the well. In the seventeenth century, in spite of the severe <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> still resorted to the well, and the record has been kept of many remarkable cures, one being that of <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">[Blessed] Father [Edward] Oldcorne, S.J.</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who was healed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> of a gangrene that had formed in the roof of his mouth.
<h2 id="section2">Origin and history of the well</h2>

<p>The stream is said to have burst from the ground more than 1200 years ago on the spot where <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a> (Gwenfrewi) was slain by Caradoc, son of an Armorican prince, about the year 634 (see <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">ST. WINEFRIDE</a>), and has flowed unceasingly ever since. The place where it rises was previously known as Sechnant or the "Dry Valley"; but the name was changed to Ffynnon Gwenfrewi (Winefride's Well), and later to Trefynnon (Holywell), the appellation which it retains to the present day. In 1093 the church at Holywell and the sacred fountain were given by Adeliza, Countess of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15588b.htm">St. Werburgh</a> in that city. In 1115 Richard, Earl of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, her son, went on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride's</a> Well. In 1240 David, son of Llewellyn, Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, granted the church and well with extensive possessions to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Basingwerk Abbey, who held them until 1537, the year of the dissolution. King Richard III ordered the sum of ten marks to be paid annually from the treasury for the support of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a>, and the stipend of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and a few years later, probably before 1495, the beautiful buildings now surrounding the Well were erected.
<h2 id="section3">Description of the well</h2>

<p>The buildings referred to are in the perpendicular style, and were erected over the spring partly through the munificence of Margaret, Countess of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> and Derby, the mother of King Henry VII; but the armorial bearings introduced into the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> show that several noble <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, including those of Stanley, Pennant, and Lewis, had a share in the work. Though time has dealt somewhat harshly with the stonework, sufficient remains to show that it was originally a most beautiful structure, abounding in delicate tracery and other carved work. The spring forms a basin enclosed by an octagonal parapet, from which rise eight delicately chiselled columns; these meet overhead in a beautiful traceried canopy, forming a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> or vault. Above this stands what was once the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> or oratory of <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a>, where <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> were wont to spend the night in vigil before bathing. Unfortunately it is now in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> hands, and used for the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> services of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church; but the Well itself, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the corporation of Holywell, has for a considerable time been held at an annual rent by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> of the Mission.

<p>The water of the spring is of a pale bluish colour, and so clear that at the bottom of the basin, seven feet below the surface, even a pin may be seen. The stones at the bottom, as well as portions of the masonry, are marked with deep crimson or purple stains, which <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> loves to regard as the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, but which naturalists account for as a peculiar kind of moss, <em>Junger mannia asplenioides</em>. The spring sends forth eighty-one tons of water per minute, the water being very cold, never rising above 50 degrees Fahrenheit in any weather, and never freezing. Chemical analysis has never detected any mineral or medicinal properties peculiar to it, that would account for the extraordinary cures, which are often instantaneous. The overflow from the octagonal basin passes into a long narrow piscina, which is entered by steps at either end. Those seeking a cure pass through this piscina, reverently kneeling in the cold water and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> an ancient cross carved in the stonework. The hard limestone steps are literally worn away by the bare feet of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. From this piscina the water passes under a low arch into a small swimming bath, with bathing cots on either side, and then flows onward through Greenfield Valley to join the River Dee, affording on its way motive power to several flannel and flour mills. In a corner opposite the entrance to the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> where the spring rises, a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a> stands in a decorated niche. The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> on emerging from the piscina throw themselves on their knees before this <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, earnestly imploring the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> intercession.
