<h1>Homiliarium</h1>  

<p>A collection of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, or familiar explanations of the Gospels (see <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">HOMILY</a>). From a very early time the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of the Fathers were in high esteem, and were read in connection with the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a>; <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">OFFICE</a>). That the custom was as old as the sixth century we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> refers to it, and that St. Benedict mentions it in his rule (Batiffol, History of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>", 107). This was particularly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a>, very terse and peculiarly suited to <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> purposes. As new feasts were added to the Office, the demand for <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> became greater and by the eighth century, the century of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> codification, collections of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> began to appear (Batiffol, op. cit., 108). Such a collection was called a <em>homiliarium</em>, or <em>homiliarius</em> (i.e. <em>liber</em>) <em>doctorum</em>. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> numerous collections of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> were made for purposes of preaching. Many homiliaria have come down to us, and there are <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> references to many others. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> (De Liturgia Gallicana) mentions a very old Gallican homiliarium. In a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the eighth century we find reference to a homiliarium by Agimundus, a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> compiled one in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In the episcopal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> there is preserved a homiliarium by Bishop Burchard, a companion of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. Alanus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a> (770), compiled a large homiliarium, which must have been often copied, for it has reached us in several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In the first half of the ninth century Smaragdus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Michael's on the Meuse, compiled from the Fathers a book of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the Gospels and Epistles for the whole year. Haymo, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and disciple of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt (841), made a collection for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a> in <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, II, 313, note). <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, another pupil of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, and Eric of Auxerre compiled each a collection of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>. All these wrote in Latin.

<p>Perhaps the most famous homiliarium is that of Paul Warnefrid, better known as <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. It was made by order of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and has been greatly misrepresented in recent times. Mosheim (Eccl. Hist., II, p. 150, London, 1845) and Neander (V, 174), followed by various encyclopedias and many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers, assert that the great emperor had it compiled in order that the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> might at least recite to the people the Gospels and Epistles on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holidays. As a matter of fact, this particular collection was not made for <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> use but for the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, as even a cursory reading of the royal decree would at once show. Its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> character is corroborated by the fact that copies were made only for such churches as were wont to recite the Office in choir. Manuscript copies of this homiliarium are still found at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, Darmstadt, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, Giessen, Kassel. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, and rediscovered by Ranke, is in Carlsruhe, and is older than the tenth century <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> copy. The earliest printed edition is that of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> in 1482. In the Cologne edition (sixteenth century) the authorship is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, but the royal decree alluded to leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the purpose or author. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> may have revised it. Though not intended expressly for preachers, the homiliarium of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> exercised an indirect influence on the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, and as late as the fifteenth or sixteenth century served for homiletic purposes. Translations of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> were frequently ordered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (v. g. Second Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, 813; Third Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, 813--cf. <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, lxxxv, 510), and became common. <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">Alfred the Great</a> translated into Anglo-Saxon the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, and, for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the "Regula Pastoralis" of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>. <a href="../cathen/01171b.htm">Aelfric</a> selected and translated into the same language passages from St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Smaragdus, and occasionally from Haymo. His aim was to work the extracts into a whole, and thus present them in an easy and intelligible style (<a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, II, 313). These translations held a prominent place in early <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>. The first German translation of this kind was due to Ottfried of Weissenburg. (See <a href="../cathen/07443a.htm">HOMILETICS</a>; <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">HOMILY</a>.)

<p>Collections of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of the Greek and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> will be found in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrology". For an account of the editions of their works, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> included, the reader is referred to Bardenhewer's "Patrology" (tr. Shahan, St. Louis, 1908). The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> that have come down to us are found principally in "The Speckled Book" (<em>Leabhar Breac</em>), which is written partly in Latin and partly in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> (see extract "Passions and Homilies", ed. Atkinson, Dublin, 1887). It is largely taken up with <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> and passions, and lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, etc. The "Book of Ballymote" contains, amongst miscellaneous subjects, Biblical and hagiological matter; and the "Book of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>" contains lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> under the form of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (see Hull, "Text Book of Irish Literature", appendix).

<p>The binding and illumination of gospels and homiliaria were both elaborate and artistic. They were frequently deposited in a highly wrought casket (<em>Arca Testamenti</em>), which in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was called <em>cumdach</em> (shrine). <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> presented a text of the Gospels with costly binding to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Lateran; and Queen Theodolinda made a similar presentation to the church at Monza (Kraus, "Geschichte der Christlichen Kunst", I, 528).
