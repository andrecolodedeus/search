<h1>Homoousion</h1>  

<p>(Gr. <em>homoousion</em> - from <em>homos</em>, same, and <em>ousia</em>, essence; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>consubstantialem</em>, of one essence or substance), the word used by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325) to express the Divinity of Christ. Arius had taught that the Son, being, in the language of Philo, the Intermediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world, was not eternal, and therefore not of the Divine substance, but a creature brought forth by the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">ARIANISM</a>) Homoousion was indeed used by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writers to signify "of the same or similar substance"; but as the unity of the Divine nature wasn't questioned, the word carried the fuller meaning: "of one and the same substance". However, not only is <em>homos</em> ambiguous; the word <em>ousia</em> itself was often taken as equivalent to <em>hypostasis</em> (person), as apparently is the case in the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Symbol</a>. And therefore the affirmation of the identity of nature might be taken in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense of the Sabellians, who denied the distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It was only after many years of controversy that the two words acquired their distinct meanings, and the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> were able to describe the Trinity as one in <em>ousia</em> and three in <em>hypostasis</em> or <em>persona</em>. Previously to the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had already used the Latin equivalent of Homoousion, conceding to Praxeas the Sabellian that the Father and the Son were <em>unius substantiae</em>, of one substance, but adding <em>duarum personarum</em>, of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (Adv. Prax., xiii). And <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> used the actual word in a letter to <a href="../cathen/05009b.htm">Dionysius of Rome</a> (Athan., "De dec. Syn. Nic.", xxv, 26) and again in his letter to <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who is, however, inconsistent in his vocabulary, expressed the anti-Sabellian sense of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> by calling the Son "Heteroousion". The question was brought into discussion by the Council of Antioch (264-272); and the Fathers seem to have rejected Homoousion, even going so far as to propose the phrase <em>heteras ousias</em>, that is, Heteroousion, "of other or different ousia". <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and Basil give as the reason for this rejection of Homoousion the fact that the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> took it to mean "of the same of similar substance". But Hilary says that Paul himself admitted it in the Sabellian sense "of the same <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or person", and thus compelled the council to allow him the prescriptive right to the expression. Now, if we may take Hilary's explanation, it is obvious that when, half a century afterwards, Arius denied the Son to be of the Divine ousia or substance, the situation was exactly reversed. Homoousion directly contradicted the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. In the conflicts which ensued, the extreme <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> persisted in the Heteroousion <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Symbol</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> were more moderate, and consequently more plausible, in their Homoiousion (of like substance). When one considers how the four creeds formulated at Antioch (341) by the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> approached the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> as nearly as possible without the actual word Homoousion, there may be a temptation to think that the question was one of words only; and the Councils of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and Seleucia (359) may seem to have been well advised in their conciliatory formula "that the Son was like the Father in all things, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>". But this very formula was forced from the Fathers by the Emperor Constantius; and the force and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> which the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> used throughout the greater part of the fourth century, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> sufficient that the dispute was not merely verbal. <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">The dogma of the Trinity</a> was at stake, and Homoousion <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself to be in the words of Epiphanius "the bond of faith", or, according to the expression of Marius Victorinus, "the rampart and wall of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>." (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">ARIANISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">TRINITY</a>.)
