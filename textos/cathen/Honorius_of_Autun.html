<h1>Honorius of Autun</h1>  

<p>(HONORIUS AUGUSTODUNENSIS)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and encyclopedic writer who lived in the first half of the twelfth century. Honorius has been correctly described as one of the most mysterious personages in all the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a>. All that can be stated with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is that he flourished between the years 1106 and 1135, that he spent the greater part of that time in Southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and that he wrote a very large number of works, most of which have come down to us. He is generally said to have been a native of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and in one of his works (De Luminaribus Ecclesi&aelig;) he styles himself "priest and head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (<em>scholasticus</em>) of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>". On the other hand, his references to contemporary events in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the frequency of German glosses in his writings, and the possibility of reading "Augustodunensis" to mean "a native of Augst" (near Basle) or "of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>" (in Swabia), have induced some historians to conclude that he was a German. In recent times it has been suggested that he was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Augustine's at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in which case "Augstodunensis" should be read "Augustinensis". Agam, it is generally supposed that he was a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and yet some of the oldest Manuscripts describe him as <em>solitarius</em>. This, of course, could mean "monk"; by some, however, it is taken literally to mean a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> or <em>inclusus</em>, and one at least of the recent writers on the subject (Endres, "Honorius Augustodunensis", Munich, 1906) does not hesitate to associate Honorius with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <em>inclusi</em> who were in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in the twelfth century. It is interesting to find that Honorius is well acquainted with <a href="../cathen/05519a.htm">John the Scot</a>, imitates his style, borrows his definition of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, writes a compendium of one of his books, and generally betrays the influence of a writer who was not considered worthy of study by the majority of Honorius's contemporaries. Curiously enough, he calls John the Scot "Joannes Scotus <em>vel Chrysostomus</em>", the latter name being probably a personal tribute to the eloquence of the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>.

<p>The list of Honorius's writings is a very long one. In Pez's "Thesaurus" ("Diss. isagog.", in vol. II, p. 4) we find as many as thirty-eight titles. Of these the most important are the following: &mdash; <ul><li>I. Philosophical works: "Imago Mundi, de Dispositione Orbis a treatise on cosmography, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, meteorology, and <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>; "De Philosophi&acirc; mundi", which treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the world, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; "Clavis Physic&aelig;, de Naturis Rerum", which, as the <em>incipit</em> of the Manuscript indicates, is a compilation "excerptus ab Honorio solitario de quinque libris cuiusdam <em>Chrisotomii</em>", that is from John the Scot; "De libero arbitrio" (two distinct works), and several short treatises on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <li>II. Theological works: "Elucidarium", a summary of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the form of a dialogue, which was translated into French in the thirteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Jeffrey of Waterford, and into German some time before the fifteenth century; "Sigillum Beat&aelig; Mari&aelig;", an exposition of the Canticle of Canticles; "Gemma Anim&aelig;", a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>; "Eucharistion", a work on the Body and Blood of Christ; "Speculum Ecclesi&aelig;", a book of sermons, and a work "De incontinenti&acirc; clericorum seu offendiculum". <li>III. Works of general <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> value, such as "De luminaribus Ecclesi&aelig;", "Summa totius Histori&aelig;", "Series Romanorum Pontificum", etc. Honorius composed a commentary on the "Tim&aelig;us of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, of which unfortunately only a fragment has come down to us. This fragment is published in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> edition of Honorius's works (P.L., CLXXII) from Cousin's edition of it in the introduction to the "Ouvrages in&eacute;dits d'Ab&eacute;lard".</ul>

<p>Honorius does not pretend to observe a distinction between the province of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In his work "Philosophia Mundi" he treats of the mystery of the Trinity, and in the treatise "De H&aelig;resibus" he enumerates the "heretics of pagan times", <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, Pythagoreans, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, etc. The distinction, which seems so natural to us, was not acknowledged generally until the time of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Honorius, as has been said, borrows his definition of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> from John the Scot. "Philosophy", he says, "is the comprehension of things visible and invisible" (eorum qu&aelig; sunt et non videntur et qu&aelig; sunt et videntur comprehensio). True to the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, he begins with the invisible, uncreated, incorporeal, and proceeds to the consideration of the visible, created, corporeal But, unlike the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, he has a proper appreciation of the value of concrete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Consequently, he devotes much space in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to the description of the actual world, and in his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculations he is far from overlooking the value of institutions, ceremonies, and the organization of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the life and career of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He thus marks one &ouml;f the first epochs in the history of the relation between speculative and positive teaching in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. At the same time he does not overlook the mystical element in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought. In fact, he is an author whose importance has been too generally ignored in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.
