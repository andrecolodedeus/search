<h1>Honor&eacute; Tourn&eacute;ly</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. Antibes, Provence, 28 August, 1658; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 December 1729. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were poor and obscure, but an uncle, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, invited him to that city and gave him a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. On completing his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, he became a doctor of the Sorbonne in 1686, and two years later was sent by the king to the University of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Here, he distinguished himself by the brilliance of his lectures and by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in opposing the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. He was even accused of forgeries in order to compromise them, but the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this accusation have never been forthcoming. Four years later he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, made a canon of the Sainte-Chapelle, and given the Abbey of Plainpied (<a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Diocese of Bourges</a>). He taught with unvarying success for twenty-four years, and at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> showed himself the determined opponent of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. In return they published pamphlets and multiplied attacks and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> to discredit him and his teaching, especially after the publication of the Constitution <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> condemned (8 Sept. 1713) their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as manifested in the "Reflections morales" of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. Tourn&eacute;ly was actively engaged in furthering the acceptance of this Constitution by the <a href="../cathen/01795a.htm">assembly of the French clergy</a>, of which he was a consultor, and by the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of which he was an influential member. When, after the death of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> (1 Sept., 1715) and after the connivance of <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal Noailles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> became masters of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, they expunged from its registers the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> and expelled from its meetings Tourn&eacute;ly and a score of his friends among the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> (Jan., 1716). It was only at the earnest intervention of the regent, the Duke of Orl&eacute;ans, that they were reinstated five years later (Feb., 1721).

<p>Tourn&eacute;ly had so far published nothing, at least in his own name, but he is regarded as the author or inspirer of several anonymous works against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> which appeared at that time. On his retirement he immediately began to revise his lectures and, at the request of Cardinal de Fleury and others, to publish them in 1725. With the common title "Pr&#230;lectiones Theologic&#230;", he issued in Latin the following treatises in octavo: "On God and His Attributes" (1725); "On grace" (1726); "On the Trinity" (1726); "On the Church" (1726); "On the Sacraments in general" (1727); "On the Incarnation" (1727); "On the Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation" (1727); "On Penance and Extreme Unction" (1728); "On the Eucharist" (1729); "On Holy Orders" (1729); "On Marriage" (1730). The work passed through several editions, among others those of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (16 vols., in 8 vo, 1731-46), Cologne (10 vols., in fol., 1752-65). Several of these treatises have been abridged for use in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and they still appear in Tourn&eacute;ly's name, but they are in reality the work of Montagne, Robinet, and Collet. Tourn&eacute;ly's own work is still so important in extent and value that he may be regarded as on of the most notable <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his age. The learned Lafiteau, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sisteron, even then declared him "one of the greatest men who has ever been in the Sorbonne", and his works were highly esteemed by <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>. His chief merits are clearness of explanation, elegance of style, deep learning and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>; his one defect was Gallicanism, for, like all French <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at that time, he was a Gallican.
