<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Hood</h1>  

<p>A flexible, conical, brimless head-dress, covering the entire head, except the face. It is either a separate garment or part of a cloak. In the first case it generally ends below in a sort of cape, sometimes open in front, and sometimes closed so that the only opening is that for the face. Among the Romans, the hood (<em>cucullus</em>, a word of Celtic origin) was worn as a separate garment especially by drivers, herdsmen, and labourers; and by all classes as part of the <em>lacerna</em>, the <em>birrus</em>, and particularly the <em>paenula</em>, varieties of cloaks. The hood in both forms was very common in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, being worn by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, high and low. It was the ordinary head-dress of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a> and was prescribed as part of the religious habit. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the hood usually ended in a long peak (<em>liripippium</em>) which extended down the back, and was used occasionally as a neck-cloth. Towards the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the hood, though not universally abandoned, was superseded by the hat, among both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>; it was retained especially by the old Orders. In fact the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> receive their name from their hood (<em>capuce</em>), which differs in form from that of the other <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. From the hood was developed the coif or cap formerly worn by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. A form of head-dress derived from the hood was the almutia (<em>almutium, armutia</em>), used by members of the chapter in choir as early as the beginning of the thirteenth century. It was notable as a rule for its large-sized cape and two horn-like puffs resting on the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, but without the <em>liripippium</em>. It was made preferably of fur, or at least lined with fur, and the lower part was adorned with fur tassels. It was never a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> garment, but only part of the choir-dress, and a distinguishing mark of the canons. As a head-covering it gradually lost its significance when the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> was adopted for the choir. As early as the sixteenth century the almutia was often carried on the arm. Today it is used only in a few places (Arras, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, etc.).

<p>Similar in form to the almutia is the <a href="../cathen/10624b.htm">mozzetta</a>, a cape provided with a small hood. Though it properly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, its use is also granted to other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and to members of distinguished chapters. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> mozzetta is red; that of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> red, rose-coloured, or violet; all others are violet, unless the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> belongs to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, in which case the colour of the mozzetta and of the religious habit is the same. It is open in front, but provided with buttons, and during Divine services is worn over the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>. Bishops wear it within their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, both inside and outside the church. Members of chapters do not wear it outside the church unless the chapter appears <em>corporaliter</em>. The mozzetta cannot be traced back farther than the fifteenth century. It is regarded either as a shortened cappa, or is derived, perhaps, and more correctly, from the almutia.
