<h1>Hortulus Anim&aelig;</h1>  

<p>(L<font size=-2>ITTLE </font> G<font size=-2>ARDEN OF THE</font> S<font size=-2>OUL</font>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book which both in its Latin and German forms was exceedingly popular in the early years of the sixteenth century. The first known edition was printed at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> by William Schaffener of Rappeltsweiler, and is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 March, 1498. After that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> new editions with various supplements and modifications were constantly issued by other printers both in <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and other German cities, and even at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Many of them, though small in size, were illustrated with beautifully designed woodcuts. Mr. C. Dodgson gives a list of eighteen editions between 1516 and 1521, all of which contained cuts by the well-known engravers Hans Springinklee and Erhard Sch&ouml;n. The earliest German edition appeared in 1501, but the Latin editions on the whole predominate. With regard to its contents, the "Hortulus" bears a general resemblance to the Hor&aelig; and Primers which were then the form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book most familiar in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. As in these latter, the Little Office of our Lady always occupies the place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but the "Hortulus" contains a greater variety of popular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, many of them recommended by curious and probably spurious <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. The name "Hortulus Anim&aelig;" was derived not from the &aelig;sthetic but from the utilitarian aspects of a garden, as is shown by the three Latin distichs prefixed to most copies of the work. The first two lines run:&mdash;

<blockquote><p>Ortulus exiguus varias ut s&aelig;pe salubres<br>Herbas producit, quas medicina probat.

<p>(A tiny garden will often produce a variety of salutary herbs of which medicine knows the value).</p></blockquote>

<p>The contents of the volume are further described as "mentis pharmaca sacr&aelig;" (the simples of the devout mind). The popularity of the book is further shown by the extreme beauty of the miniatures in some existing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> examples. One of these at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (Bibl. Pal. 2706) has recently been produced in exquisite facsimile by D&ouml;rnh&ouml;ffer.

<p>The title in particular was found attractive. Another German <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book, "Das Wurtzg&#228;rt linder and&#228;chtigen Uebung" (the herb garden of devout practices) was edited by an Observantine <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1513, but it is a quite different work. So a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> adaptation of the "Hortulus" was produced in 1569 [perhaps 1550 &#151; <em>Ed.</em>] which was called the "Lustgarten der Seelen" (the pleasure garden of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>)&mdash;though this perhaps corresponds better to the other famous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book the "Paradisus Anim&aelig;". It should be noted also that yet another well-known work of devotion, which was not a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book but a volume of moral instruction richly illustrated with stories, bore a similar title. This was "Der Selen W&uuml;rtzgart," of which the first edition was printed at Ulm in 1483. The title, "Garden of the Soul", is of course very familiar to English readers from the popular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book which was compiled by <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Bishop Challoner</a> about the year 1740, and which has since been reprinted and re-edited in countless editions.
