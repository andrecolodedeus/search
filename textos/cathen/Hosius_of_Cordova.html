<h1>Hosius of Cordova</h1>  

<p>The foremost Western champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in the early anti-Arian struggle; born about 256; died about 358, either at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> or in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In early life he was a confessor of the Faith in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> (Morse) or of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (Hefele), and became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> about 295. His name is mentioned amongst the nineteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present at the provincial Council of Elvira (c. 300). Leclercq enumerates certain facts which show Hosius to have been in close personal relations with the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> on several occasions between 313 and 324, and he is known to have been his chief adviser in dealing with the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. We have nothing to explain the origin of the connexion between them. When the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> troubles began, Constantine charged Hosius with the delivery of his letter to Arius and Alexander, in which he urged them to reconciliation. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> little of Hosius's action during this mission (323-324). When the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> met, Hosius presided, together with the two Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Vitus and Vincent. In what capacity he presided is a matter much discussed: <a href="../cathen/06407b.htm">Gelasius of Cyzicus</a> is categorical in declaring that it was in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Hist. Nic. Conc., Bk. II, c. v). Hefele is of the same opinion. Chapman holds that he was nominated by Constantine. Leclercq inclines to the same opinion, but leaves the question open. After the council, Hosius probably returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Constantine dying, 22 May, 337, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was recalled from his first exile in 338, only to be expelled by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in 340. After passing three years in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> went in 343 into Gaul to confer with Hosius, and thence to <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, where the council began in the summer, or, at latest, in the autumn of 343. Hosius presided, proposed the canons, and was the first to sign the Acts of the council.

<p>In the letter of the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a>, given in <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../fathers/28081.htm"><em>Apologia contra Arianos</em> 44</a>, Hosius is spoken of as "one who on account of his age, his confession, and the many labours he had undergone, is worthy of all reverence". The suggested explanation of the symbol of Nic&aelig;a did not meet the approval of the council (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, p. 758). After Sardica we lose sight of him for ten years, until <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius's</a> letter to him (c. 353), after the fall of Vincent of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. The prestige given to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> cause by the support of the venerable Hosius led the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to bring pressure to bear upon Constantius II, who had him summoned to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (Gwatkin, p. 292). He declined to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> or to hold communion with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. He so impressed the emperor that he was authorized to return home. More <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> pressure led to Constantius writing a letter demanding whether he alone was going to remain obstinate. In reply Hosius sent his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> letter of protest against imperial meddling in Church affairs, preserved for us by St. Athanasius (Hist. Arianorum, 42-45, cf. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., VIII, 1327-1332), which led to his summons (end of 353) to <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>.

<p>The facts relating to the end of his life are far from clear; under pressure, he signed the declaration known as the second <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> formula (the first being the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of 351), which was published as the formula of Hosius. The original Latin text is preserved in St. Hilary's "De Synodis", c. XI (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., X, 598), the Greek, in <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>: "De Syn.", 28. He refused, however, to renounce <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, who speaks of him as <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsing</a> "for a moment"; having served the purpose for which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> brought him to <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, he was probably taken back to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and there died. A later addition to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> declares that he recanted on his death-bed. The defenders of Hosius contend that the concession wrung from him has been much magnified and misrepresented. But it is contended that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> cannot have had all the facts before him when he wrote, and that the second <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> formula is clearly heterodox.
