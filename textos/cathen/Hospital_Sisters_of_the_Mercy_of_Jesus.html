<h1>Hospital Sisters of the Mercy of Jesus</h1>  

<p>These sisters are established in religion under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, the institute being dependent on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> represented by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Before the end of the thirteenth century the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of Dieppe (<a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Diocese of Rouen</a>) was served by <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermit</a> Sisters of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. They formed a secular congregation, lived on goods held in common and on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and observed constitutions drawn up for their use. Apart from the services they rendered to the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, they were also employed in assisting the sick <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> in all quarters of the city. To these primitive hospitallers is connected, by an unbroken chain of credible traditions, the Institute of the Mercy of Jesus, a branch of the order founded by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. The constitution establishes two classes of religious: <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> sisters and choir sisters. The former are employed at the manual tasks of the community, in order to relieve the choir religious. They are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recite the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, neither do they nurse the sick. The choir religious are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recite the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in common, and daily employed in attendance on the sick. They are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> as far as health will permit to go at least once a day to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> to render some service to the poor. Two of their number take in turn the night-watch in the wards.

<p>The chapter is composed of all who are ten years professed. They <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> a superior triennially, but her charge may not be prolonged beyond six years. They also elect the assistant, the mistress of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, the treasurer, and four other advisers, thus forming the council of eight principal officers. The same officers may be retained as long as they have the majority of votes in the chapter. The costume of the sisters is entirely white with a black veil for the professed and a white veil for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. This costume is the same as that formerly worn by the <a href="../cathen/03255b.htm">Canonesses</a> of St. Augustine. A gown and a leather girdle, a gimp, a bandeau, and a veil compose the different parts, to which is added a black serge cape for choir <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Today the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Mercy of Jesus have communities in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at Dieppe, <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, Eu, Vitr&eacute;, Ch&acirc;teau-Goutier-St-Julien, Ch&acirc;teau-Goutier-St-Joseph, Malestroit, Auray, Tr&eacute;guier, Lannion, Guingamp, Morlaix, Pont-l'Abb&eacute;, Gouarec, Foug&egrave;res, Harcourt, and Bayeux; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, at Waterloo (Liverpool); in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, at Quebec (3 communities), L&eacute;vis, and Chicoutimi; in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, at Estcourt (Natal), Durban, Ladysmith, and Pietermaritzburg; in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, at Maasbracht; and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>.
