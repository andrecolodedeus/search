<h1>Hospitality</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in its twenty-fifth session, cap. viii, De Ref., enjoins "all who hold any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, whether secular or regular, to accustom themselves, as far as their revenues will allow, to exercise with alacrity and kindness the office of hospitality, so frequently commended by the holy Fathers; being mindful that those who cherish hospitality receive Christ in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of their guests". This sums up the teaching and tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with regard to hospitality. The onus of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> falls especially on two classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> &mdash; upon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as being in the fullest sense the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> (i.e. shepherds) of the people and as being primarily vested, according to the ancient canons, with the administration of the contributions of the faithful (see <a href="../cathen/04104b.htm">COLLECTIONS</a>); and secondly upon religious, and in particular the monastic orders, as having made their renunciation of the goods of this world the better to perform the works of mercy towards others.

<p>With regard to the hospitality of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, we may note that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> writing to St. Augustine in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and directing that the offerings of the faithful should be subjected to a fourfold division, assigns the first portion "to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his household on account of hospitality and entertainment". It seems from this and other passages that in the earliest period <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> commonly maintained a sort of hospice. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the functionaries known as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> had some connexion with this, and the original institution of canons regular may be regarded as a development of this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> household, the canons sharing a common table which was provided and presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the "Didascalia Apostolorum" (ii, 3-4), a work of the second half of the third century, much stress is laid upon generous and hospitable <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> as desirable qualities in a bishop-elect. But the details of episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> and practice will best be studied in the pages of <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of hospitality was insisted upon from the beginning both in East and West. Even among the communities of Nitria in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as we learn from <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> (Lausiac Hist., cap. vii; ed. Butler, ii, 25), we find that a <em>xenodocheion</em>, or hospice, was wont to be erected for their visitors in these remote regions. There the traveller might remain for a week, but if his stay exceeded that limit he was supposed to return some sort of equivalent in the form of work. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of hospitality so strongly insisted upon both in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> (e.g. <a href="../bible/jdg019.htm#vrs20">Judges 19:20</a>; <a href="../bible/gen018.htm#vrs4">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="../bible/gen019.htm#vrs7">19:7 sq.</a>, etc.; <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs40">Matthew 10:40 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rom012.htm#vrs13">Romans 12:13</a>, etc.) was felt to be specially incumbent on those who aspired to perfection, and the narratives of the early <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the Holy Land (for example that of &AElig;theria) reveal how widely it was practised throughout the East. For Western monachism, the most striking evidence is to be found in chap. liii of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>: "Let all guests that come", it directs, "be received like <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, for He will say 'I was a stranger and ye took Me in.' And let fitting <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> be shown to all, especially such as are of the household of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to wayfarers (<em>peregrinis</em>). When, therefore, a guest is announced, let him be met (<em>occurratur ei</em>) by the superior or the brethren, with all due charity. Let them first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> together, and thus associate with one another in peace . . . At the arrival or departure of all guests, let Christ, Who indeed is received in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, be adored in them by bowing the head or even prostrating on the ground . . . Let the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> pour water on the hands of the guests, and himself as well as the whole community wash their feet . . . Let special care be taken in the reception of the poor and of wayfarers (<em>peregrinorum</em>) because in these Christ is more truly welcomed." So important was the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of hospitality that it was always to be considered in the construction of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. "Let the kitchen for the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and guests be apart by itself, so that strangers (<em>hospites</em>), who are never wanting in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, may not disturb the brethren by coming at unlooked for hours." This primitive text has left its stamp upon all the subsequent developments of the monastic rule, from <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">Benedict of Aniane</a> downwards, while the prominence of the guest-house in all monastic buildings, beginning with the famous plan of St. Gall in the ninth century, attests indirectly how scrupulously this tradition was respected. (See Lenoir, "Architecture Monastique", II, 396-402.)

<p>It would be impossible to go into details here, but we may notice how this aspect of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> was emphasized among the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, the most important of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> reforms. <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, admits that if their establishments had departed from primitive <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> simplicity, by great expenditure and extravagance, it was their generous hospitality which was to blame. The very arrangement of their houses seemed designed primarily for the entertainment of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and the poor. The lodging of both the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the porter was near the main entrance, apart from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> gate being always kept shut, the porter lived near "that the guest on his first arriving might find someone to welcome him". The "Liber Usuum" directs that the porter should open the door saying <em><a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">Deo gratias</a></em>, and, after a <em>Benedicite</em> as a salutation, should ask the stranger who he is and what he requires. "If he wishes to be admitted, the porter kneels to him and bids him enter and sit down near the porter's cell while he goes to fetch the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>." It was the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to dine with his guests rather than with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The same traditions obtained in the older <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> houses; and at all periods a wonderful example has been set by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> during times of famine, pestilence, etc. For the charity of the Cluniacs, e.g. in the great famine of 1029, see Sackur, "Die Cluniacenser", II, 213-216. To this ideal the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> seem to have remained faithful to the last. In that remarkable record of monastic life at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period known as the "Rites of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>" we find a glowing account of the splendour of their guest-house and of the hospitality they practised. The usual period during which hospitality was freely provided was two complete days; and some similar restriction upon the abuse of hospitality seems to have been prescribed by most of the orders, <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. There were of course certain orders, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem</a>, which were largely given up to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and hospitality. But the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of harbouring <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> was secondary to that of nursing the sick.
