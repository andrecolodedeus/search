<h1>Hospitallers</h1>  

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, among the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> established throughout the West (<em>Maisons-Dieu</em> or <em>H&ocirc;tels-Dieu</em>), in which religious of both sexes lived under one roof, following the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, and vowed to perpetual chastity and the service of the sick and poor, the most famous was the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Early in the seventeenth century M&egrave;re Genevi&egrave;ve Bouquet established a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> to replace the system by which each religious trained a certain number of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, and introduced the custom of taking a saint's name. Up to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> twelve resident canons recited the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>. The congregation survived both the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and the disorders of 1830.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> organized at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> did not overlook the care of the sick, and found auxiliaries in the communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> instituted for this work, under the same rules and patronage. Thus the labours of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> in tending those afflicted with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> were shared by the <em>Hospital Sisters of St. Lazarus</em>.

<p><em>The Hospitaller Sisters of St. John of Jerusalem</em>, early in the twelfth century, were established in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Mary Magdalen, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, for the care of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The year after the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1188) a community was established at Sixena, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, by Sancha, wife of Alfonso II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, for the care of poor ladies of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and the rule was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> in 1193. Except from 1470 to 1569, when they were under the immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the sisters were subject to the Grand Master of the Hospitallers. Other communities were soon founded throughout <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A reform was instituted in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Beaulieu in the first years of the seventeenth century; new constitutions were drawn up in 1636, and approved in 1644. After the fall of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a> the original habit of red, with a black mantle, <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> with the cross of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a>, was exchanged for one of black. On the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, the few houses of sisters of that order were united with those of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a>.

<p>The first house of the <em>Hospitaller Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a></em> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was founded in 1299 at Kunitz near Bern, soon followed by others, none of which survived the secularization of 1803. The order was revived in 1841 by Maximilian III Joseph, Duke of Austria-Este. Besides the care of the sick, the sisters devote themselves to the work of teaching. There are four mother-houses: Troppau, with 2 filial <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and 123 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Lana, 15 filial <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">houses</a>, 89 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Freudenthal, 3 filial <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">houses</a>, 67 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Friesach, 1 filial house, 29 sisters.

<p><em>The Hospitallers of the Holy Ghost</em>, were a branch of the male order of the same name, founded in 1180 at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>; established at Neufch&acirc;teau, they were driven thence in 1842 to Rouceux, which was made the mother-house, under a superior-general. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the houses at Memmingen and Wimpfen, in Swabia, survived until the secularization of 1803. There is still a house at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, founded in 1618. with 27 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, conducting a boarding-school. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Poligny was revived after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the religious devoting themselves chiefly to children, especially foundlings.

<p>Among the foundations of more recent times are the following: <em>The Hospitallers of Loches</em>, founded in 1621 by Susanne Dubois, a religious of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; some seventeen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were founded at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, Riom, and other cities of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <em>Hospitallers of <a href="../cathen/14696a.htm">St. Thomas of Villanova</a></em> were instituted in 1660 by Ange Le Proust, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> at Lamballe. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> their house in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was not closed. The congregation was re-established in 1804 and in 1903 had 100 institutions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, having received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> in 1878. The <em>Hospitallers of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> and Langres</em> were founded by P&egrave;re Joly in 1685. The <em>Hospitallers of Ste-Marthe</em>, established in 1687 at Pontarlieu, for the care of the sick and poor and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls, soon spread over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The <em>Hospitallers of Ernemont</em>, also known as Sisters of the Christian Schools and Bonnes Capotes, owed their foundation (1698) to <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#II">Archbishop Jacques-Nicolas Colbert</a>, their aim being gratuitous teaching and the care of the sick. The mother-house was reopened in 1803 after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Since 1903 the sisters have confined themselves chiefly to the care of the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and their own homes.

<p>The <em>Hospitallers of St. Joseph</em> were founded at Lafl&egrave;che, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1636, by Marie de la Ferre, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>. Convents were soon established at Laval, Baug&eacute;, and Beaufort, in all of which Mlle de Melun, Princesse de l'Epinoy, and a member of the order, took an important part. The religious were first bound by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> only, but the custom inaugurated at Laval in 1663 of taking solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> was soon followed at <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Moulins</a>, Baug&eacute;, and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The congregation was approved by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in 1666 and recognized by the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1667. The constitutions were revised in 1685 by Henri Arnaud, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>. In addition to the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the sisters were bound by a fourth to the service of the poor. Besides the choir and lay sisters, associate sisters are received, who, through some cause unable to take upon themselves the full <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the professed, desire to pass the rest of their life under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The Laval sisters survived the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and on the reorganization, regained their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The founders of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> were accompanied to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> by <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Mlle Mance</a>, who after carrying on the work of caring for the sick for seventeen years in the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, in 1659 brought over the Hospitallers of Lafl&egrave;che, who in spite of three serious conflagrations and the deprivation of their income from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> have now 132 sisters caring annually for 3205 patients. In 1845 the first filial foundation was made at <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, and now numbers 54 religious, 60 patients, and 32 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. The Kingston house also opened <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Cornwall, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, in 1897 (27 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 30 patients), and Englewood, a suburb of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, in 1903 (11 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 300 patients); in connexion with the latter is a training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for nurses. From <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> were founded in 1869 the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/03642a.htm">Chatham</a>, N. B. (44 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 25 patients, and an academy, with 42 pupils); that of St-Basile (1873), where there are also a boarding-school, academy, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> (54 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 150 pupils, 50 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>); Windsor, in 1889 (20 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 35 patients); Tracadie, New Brunswick, 1868 (30 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 38 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>), where since 1820 <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> had been rampant, and where were later established a general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and a dispensary, treating 2000 patients annually; Athabaskaville, in 1881 (23 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 60 patients); Campbellton, in 1889 (14 sisters); Burlington, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, in 1894 (28 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 45 patients).
