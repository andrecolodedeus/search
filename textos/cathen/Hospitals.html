<h1>Hospitals</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>hospes</em>, a guest; hence <em>hospitalis</em>, hospitable; <em>hospitium</em>, a guest-house or guest-room)

<p>Originally, <em>hospital</em> meant a place where strangers or visitors were received; in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, its use was restricted to institutions for the care of the sick. This modification is incidental to the long development through which the hospital itself has passed under the varying influences of religious, political, and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions, and of social and scientific progress. Viewed in a large way the typical modern hospital represents natural human solicitude for suffering, ennobled by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity and made efficient by the abundant resources of medical skill.
<h2>Pagan antiquity</h2>

<p>While among savage tribes, e.g. the ancient Germans, the sick and feeble were often <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, more humane practices are found among civilized peoples. One of the earliest hospitals on record was founded in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 300 <font size=-2>B. C., </font> by Princess Macha. It was called "Broin Bearg" (house of sorrow), and was used by the Red Branch Knights and served as the royal residence in Ulster until its destruction in <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 332 ("Seanchus M&oacute;r", 123; cf. Sir W. Wilde, "Notes on Ancient Ireland", pt. III). In <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> King Azoka (252 <em>B. C.</em>) established a hospital for men and animals. The Mexicans in pre-Columbian times had various institutions in which the sick and poor were cared for (Bancroft, "Native Races", II, 596). In a general way the advance in medical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> implies that more was done to relieve suffering; but it does not necessarily prove the existence of hospitals. From the Papyri (notably Ebers) we learn that the Egyptians employed a considerable number of remedies and that the physicians held clinics in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. Similar customs prevailed in Greece; the sick resorted to the temple of &AElig;sculapius where they spent the night (<em>incubatio</em>) in the hope of receiving directions from the god through dreams which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> interpreted. Lay physicians (<em>&AElig;sculapiades</em>) conducted dispensaries in which the poor received treatment. At Epidaurus the Roman senator Antoninus erected (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 170) two establishments, one for the dying and the other for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> lying-in; patients of these classes were not admitted in the &AElig;sculapium.

<p>The Romans in their treatment of the sick adopted many Greek usages. &AElig;sculapius had a temple on the island in the Tiber (291 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), where now stand the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Bartholomew, in which the same rites were observed as among the Greeks. Municipal physicians were appointed to treat various classes of citizens, and these practitioners usually enjoyed special privileges and <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>. Provision was made in particular for the care of sick soldiers and slaves, the latter receiving attention in the <em>valetudinaria</em> attached to the estates of the wealthier Romans. But there is no record of any institution corresponding to our modern hospital. It is noteworthy that among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> peoples the care of the sick bears no proportion to the advance of civilization. Though Greece and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> attained the highest degree of culture, their treatment of the sick was scarcely equal, certainly not superior, to that which was found in the oriental nations. Both Greeks and Romans regarded disease as a curse inflicted by <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> powers and rather sought to propitiate the malevolent deity than to organize the work of relief. On the other hand the virtue of hospitality was quite generally insisted on; and this trait, as will presently appear, holds a prominent place in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity.
<h2>Early Christian times</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself gave His followers the example of caring for the sick by the numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> He wrought to heal various forms of disease including the most loathsome, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. He also charged His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in explicit terms to heal the sick (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs9">Luke 10:9</a>) and promised to those who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him that they would have power over disease (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs18">Mark 16:18</a>). Among the "many wonders and signs done by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" was the restoration of the lame man (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs2">Acts 3:2-8</a>), of the palsied &AElig;neas (ix, 33, 34), and of the cripple at <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a> (xiv, 7, 9), besides the larger number whom the shadow of St. Peter delivered from their infirmities (v, 15, 16). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> enumerates among the charismata the "grace of healing" (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 12:9</a>), and St. James (v, 14, 15) admonishes the faithful in case of sickness to bring in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and let them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> over the sick man "and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall save him," The Sacrament of Extreme Unction was instituted not only for the spiritual benefit of the sick but also for the restoration of their bodily health. Like the other works of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, the care of the sick was from the beginning a sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for each of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but it devolved in a special way upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. The same ministrations that brought relief to the poor naturally included provision for the sick who were visited in their homes. This was especially the case during the epidemics that raged in different parts of the Roman Empire, such as that at Carthage in 252 (St. Cyprian, "De mortalitate", XIV, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., IV, 591-593; "S. Cypriani Vita" in "Acta SS.", 14 Sept.), and that at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in 268 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.22</a>; "Acta SS.", VI, 726). Valuable assistance was also rendered by physicians, slaves, or freedmen, who had become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and who like Cosmas and Damian were no less solicitous for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> than for the physical needs and bodily comfort and well-being of their patients.



<p>Another characteristic of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity was the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and practice of hospitality (<a href="../bible/rom012.htm#vrs13">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#vrs2">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#vrs9">1 Peter 4:9</a>; <a href="../bible/3jo001.htm">3 John</a>). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in particular must be "given to hospitality" (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, therefore, in going from place to place, was welcomed in the houses of the brethren; but like hospitality was extended to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> visitor as well. <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> praises the Corinthians for their hospitality (Ep. ad. Cor., c. i) and <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius of Corinth</a> for the same reason gives credit to the Romans (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23</a>). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house above all others was open to the traveller who not only found food and shelter there but was provided in case of need with the means to continue his journey. In some cases the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was also a physician so that medical attention was provided for those of his guests who needed it (Harnack, "Medicinisches aus d. &auml;ltesten Kirchengesch." in "Texte u. Untersuchungen" VIII, Leipzig, 1892). The sick were also cared for in the <em>valetudinaria</em> of the wealthier <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who in the spirit of charity extended hospitality to those who could not be accommodated in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house. There was thus from the earliest times a well organized system of providing for the various forms of suffering; but it was necessarily limited and dependent on private endeavour so long as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were under the ban of a hostile State. Until <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ceased, an institution of a public character such as our modern hospital was out of the question. it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that after the conversion of Constantine, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> profited by their larger liberty to provide for the sick by means of hospitals. But various motives and causes have been assigned to explain the development from private care of the sick to the institutional work of the hospital (Uhlhorn, I, 317 sq.). It was not, at any rate, due to a slackening of charity as has been asserted (Moreau-Christophe, "Du probl&egrave;me de la mis&egrave;re", II, 236; III, 527), but rather to the rapid increase in the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and to the spread of poverty under new <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions. To meet these demands, a different kind of organization was required, and this, in conformity with the prevalent tendency to give all work for the common weal an institutional character, led to the organization and founding of hospitals.

<p>When and where the first hospital was established is a matter of dispute. According to some authorities (e.g. Ratzinger, p. 141), St. Zoticus built one at Constantinople during the reign of Constantine, but this has been denied (cf. Uhlhorn, I, 319). But that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the East had founded hospitals before <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> came to the throne (361) is evident from the letter which that emperor sent to Arsacius, high-priest of Galatia, directing him to establish a xenodochium in each city to be supported out of the public revenues (Soxomen, V, 16). As he plainly declares, his motive was to rival the philanthropic work of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who cared for the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> as well as for their own. A splendid instance of this comprehensive charity is found in the work of <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> who, during the plague at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (375), provided 300 beds for the sufferers. But the most famous foundation was that of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> at C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia (369). This "Basilias", as it was called, took on the dimensions of a city with its regular streets, buildings for different classes of patients, dwellings for physicians and nurses, workshop and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> was deeply impressed by the extent and efficiency of this institution which he calls "an easy ascent to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" and which he describes enthusiastically (Or. 39, "In laudem Basilii"; Or. fun. "In Basil.", P.G., XXXVI, 578-579). St. Basil's example was followed throughout the East: at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> by <a href="../cathen/08486a.htm">St. John the Almsgiver</a> (610); at Ephesus by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Brassianus; at Constantinople by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> and others, notably <a href="../cathen/12561c.htm">St. Pulcheria</a>, sister of Theodosius II, who founded "multa publica hospitum et pauperum domicilia" i.e. many homes for strangers and for the poor (Acta SS., XLIII). In the same city, <a href="../cathen/13422c.htm">St. Samson</a> early in the sixth century, founded a hospital near the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia (Procopius, "De &aelig;dif. Justiniani", I, c. 2); this was destroyed but was restored under Justinian who also built other hospitals in Constantinople. <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a> (Historia Byzantina, II, "Constantinopolis Christiana") enumerates 35 establishments of the kind in this city alone. Among the later foundations in Constantinople, the most notable were the orphanotrophium established by Alexius I (1081-1118), and the hospital of the Forty Martyrs by Isaac II (1185-1195).

<p>The fact that the first hospitals were founded in the East accounts for the use, even in the West, of names derived from the Greek to designate the main purpose of each institution. Of the terms most frequently met with the <em>Nosocomium</em> was for the sick; the <em>Brephotrophium</em> for foundlings; the <em>Orphanotrophium</em> for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; the <em>Ptochium</em> for the poor who were unable to work; the <em>Gerontochium</em> for the aged; the <em>Xenodochium</em> for poor or infirm <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The same institution often ministered to various needs; the strict differentiation implied by these names was brought about gradually. In the West, the earliest foundation was that of Fabiola at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 400. "She first of all", says <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, "established a nosocomium to gather in the sick from the streets and to nurse the wretched sufferers wasted with poverty and disease" (Ep. LXXVII; "Ad Oceanum, de morte Fabiol&aelig;", P.L., XXII, 694). About the same time, the Roman senator Pammachius founded a xenodochium at Porto which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> praises in his letter on the death of Paulina, wife of Pammachius (Ep. LXVI, P.L., XXII, 645). According to <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, the foundations of this structure were unearthed by Prince Torlonia ("Bull. di Arch. Christ.", 1866, pp.50, 99). Pope Symmachus (498-514) built hospitals in connexion with the churches of St. Peter, <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> (Lib. Pontif. I, no. 63, p. 263. During the pontificate of Vigilius (537-555) Belisarius founded a xenodochium in the Via Lata at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Lib. Pontif, l. c. 296). <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> (578-590) converted his dwelling into a refuge for the poor and aged. <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> (752-757) restored four ancient xenodochia, and added three others. It was not only in countries that retained the traditions of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> culture and civilization that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> exerted its beneficent influence; the same spirit of charity appears wherever the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> is spread among the fierce and uncultured peoples just emerging from barbarism.

<p>The first establishment in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> dates from the sixth century, when the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> King Chuldebert and his spouse founded a xenodochium at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, which was approved by the Fifth Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (549). Other foundations were those of Brunehaut, wife of King Sigibert, at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> (close of sixth century); of St. Radegonda, wife of Clotaire, at Athis, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; of Dagobert I (622-638), at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; of C&aelig;sarius and his sister St. C&aelig;saria at Arles (542); and the hospice to which <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> (806-882) assigned considerable revenues. Regarding the origin of the institution later known as the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, there is no little divergence of opinion. It has been attributed to Landry, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; H&auml;ser (IV, 28) places it in 660, <a href="../cathen/06465a.htm">De G&eacute;rando</a> (IV, 248) in 800. According to Lallemand (II, 184) it is first mentioned in 829 (cf. Coyecque, "L'Hotel-Dieu de Paris au Moyen Age", I, 20). As the name indicates, it belongs to that group of institutions which grew up in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or with the principal church of each large city and for which no precise date can be assigned. The same uncertainty prevails in regard to other foundations such as the <em>hospitalia Scothorum</em>, established on the Continent by <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, which had fallen into decay and which the Council of Meaux (845) ordered to be restored. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the most important institution for the care of the sick was that founded in 580 by Bishop Masona at <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a> Emerita (M&eacute;rida), a town in the Province of <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>. From the account given by <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a> we learn that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> endowed this hospital with large revenues, supplied it with physicians and nurses, and gave orders that wherever they found a sick man, "slave or free, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>", they should bring him in their arms to the hospital and provide him with bed and proper nourishment (<em>cibos delicatos eosque pr&oelig;paratos</em>). See Fl&ouml;rez, "Espa&ntilde;a Sagrada", XIII, 539; Heusinger, "Em Beitrag", etc. in "Janus", 1846, I.
<h2>Middle Ages</h2>

<p>During the period of decline and corruption which culminated under <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> the hospitals, like other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, suffered considerably. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, therefore, along with his other reforms, made wise provision for the care of the sick by decreeing that those hospitals which had been well conducted and had fallen into decay should be restored in accordance with the needs of the time (Capit. duplex, 803, c. iii). He further ordered that a hospital should be attached to each <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> in his "Capitula ad presbyteros" (Harduin, Y, 392) exhorts his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to supply the needs of the sick and the poor. Notwithstanding these measures, there followed, after <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> death (814), another period of decadence marked by widespread abuse and disorder. The hospitals suffered in various ways, especially through the loss of their revenues which were confiscated or diverted to other purposes. In a letter to Louis the Pious written about 822, Victor, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, complains that the hospitals were destroyed. But even under these unfavourable conditions many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were distinguished by their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and charity, among them Ansgar (q.v.), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (died 865), who founded a hospital in Bremen which he visited daily. During the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> became a dominant factor in hospital work. The famous <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Cluny, founded in 910, set the example which was widely imitated throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Besides its infirmary for the religious, each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had a hospital (<em>hospitale pauperum, or eleemosynaria</em>) in which externs were cared for. These were in charge of the <em>eleemosynarius</em>, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, carefully prescribed by the rule, included every sort of service that the visitor or patient could require. As he was also <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to seek out the sick and needy in the neighbourhood, each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became a centre for the relief of suffering. Among the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> notable in this respect were those of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at <a href="../cathen/04355d.htm">Corbie</a> in Picardy, Hirschau, Braunweiler, Deutz, Ilsenburg, Liesborn, Pr&uuml;m, and <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>; those of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Arnsberg, Baumgarten, Eberbach, Himmenrode, Herrnalb, Volkenrode, and Walkenried, No less efficient was the work done by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in accordance with the disciplinary enactments of the councils of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (817, 836), which prescribed that a hospital should be maintained in connexion with each collegiate church. The canons were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contribute towards the support of the hospital, and one of their number had charge of the inmates. As these hospitals were located in cities, more numerous demands were made upon them than upon those attached to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In this movement the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> naturally took the lead, hence the hospitals founded by Heribert (died 1021) in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Godard (died 1038) in <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, Conrad (died 975) in <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> and Ulrich (died 973) in <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. But similar provision was made by the other churches; thus at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> the hospitals of St. Maximin, St. Matthew, St. Simeon, and St. James took their names from the churches to which they were attached. During the period 1207-1577 no 1?ss than one hundred and fifty-five hospitals were founded in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (Virchow in "Gesch. Abhandl.", II).
<h3>The hospital orders</h3>

<p>The establishment of confraternities and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders for the purpose of ministering to the sick is one of the most important phases in this whole development. The first of these appeared at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> towards the end of the ninth century, when Soror (died 898) founded the hospital of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Scala and drew up its rules. The management was largely in the hands of the citizens, though subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> control until 1194, when <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> exempted it from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Similar institutions, for the most part governed by the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, sprang up in all parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; but by the beginning of the thirteenth century they had passed from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> control to that of the magistrate. In the northern countries &mdash; <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines and Beghards</a>, established in the latter part of the twelfth century, included in their charitable work the care of the sick. <a href="../cathen/05389a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Hungary</a> founded two hospitals at Eisenach and a third on the Wartburg. The origin and work of the <a href="../cathen/01306b.htm">Alexians</a> and Antonines have been described in the articles <a href="../cathen/01306b.htm">ALEXIANS</a> and ORDERS OF SAINT ANTHONY, sub-tit1e <em>Antonines</em>. But the most important of the orders established during this period was that of the Holy Ghost. About the middle of the twelfth century (c. 1145) Guy of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> had opened in that city a hospital in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Holy Ghost and prescribed the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> for the brothers in charge, Approved 23 April, 1198, by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, this institute spread rapidly throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1204 the same pontiff built a hospital called S. Maria in Sassia, where King Ina, about 728, had founded the <em>schola</em> for English <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> command, Guy de Montpellier came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and took charge of this hospital, which was thenceforward Santo Spirito in Sassia. (Cf. Morichini, "Instituti di carit&agrave; . . . in Roma", Rome, 1870.) The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> example was imitated all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Nearly every city had a hospital of the Holy Ghost, though not all the institutions bearing this name belonged to the order which Guy of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> had founded. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself Cardinal Giovanni Colonna founded (1216) the hospital of S. Andrea, not far from the Lateran; and in accordance with the will of Cardinal Pietro Colonna the hospital of S. Giacomo in Augusta was founded in 1339. Querini ("La Beneficenza Romana", Rome, 1892) gives the foundations in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as follows: eleventh century, four; twelfth, six; thirteenth, ten; fourteenth, five; fifteenth, five, i.e. a total of thirty hospitals for the care of the sick and infirm founded in the city of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.
<h3>The military orders</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> gave rise to various orders of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a> which combined with military service the care of the sick. The earliest of these was the Order of St. John. Several hospitals had already been founded in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to provide for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; the oldest was that connected with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of S. Maria Latina, founded according to one account by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in 800; whether the Order of St. John grew out of this or out of the hospital established (1065-70) by Maurus, a wealthy merchant from <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, is uncertain. At all events, when the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> reached <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1099, Gerhard the superior of the latter hospital, give the establishment a new building near the church of St. John the Baptist, whence apparently the order took its name. It also spread rapidly in the Holy Land and in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially in the Mediterranean ports which were crowded with <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. Its original purpose was hospital work and according to the description given (c. 1160) by John of Wisburg (Pez, "Anecdota", I, 3, 526) the hospital at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> cared for over 2000 patients. The military feature was introduced towards the middle of the twelfth century. In both respects the order for a time rendered excellent service, but during the thirteenth century increasing wealth and laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> brought about a decline in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and the care of the sick was in large measure abandoned.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> developed out of the field hospital under the walls of Acre, in which Count Adolf of Holstein with other German citizens (from <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and L&uuml;beck) ministered to the sick and wounded. Under the name of "domus hospitalis S. Mari&aelig; Teutonicorum in Jerusalem", it was approved by <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> in 1191. The members bound themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to the service of the sick, and the rule prescribed that wherever the order was introduced it should build a hospital. The centre of its activity however, was soon transferred from the Holy Land to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> where, owing to its strict organization and excellent administrative methods, it was given charge of many already existing hospitals. Among its numerous establishments those at Elbing and <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> enjoyed the highest repute. In spite, however, of prudent management and of loyalty to its original purpose, the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> suffered so severely through financial losses and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that by the end of the fifteenth century its pristine vigour was almost spent.
<h3>City hospitals</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, by opening up freer communication with the East, had quickened the spirit of commercial enterprise throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and in consequence, the city, as distinct from the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> estate and the village, came into existence. The resulting <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions affected the hospital development in two ways. The increasing population of the cities necessitated the construction of numerous hospitals; on the other hand, more abundant means were provided for charitable work. Foundations by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> became more frequent. Public-spirited <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, guilds, brotherhoods, and municipalities gave freely towards establishing and endowing hospitals. In this movement the Italian cities were foremost. Monza in the twelfth century had three; <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> eleven; Florence (fourteenth century) thirty. The most famous were: La Casa Santa di Santa Maria Annunziata at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, founded in 1304 by the brothers Nicoolo and Giacomo Scondito; Santa Maria Nuova at Florence (1285) by Falco Portinari, the father of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> Beatrice; and the Ospedale Maggiore at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1456) by Duke Francesco Sforza and his wife Bianca Maria. The German towns were no less active; Stendal had seven hospitals; Quedlinburg, four; Halberstadt eight; Magdeburg, five; Halle, four; Erf&uuml;rt, nine; Cologne, sixteen (cf. Uhlhorn, II, 199 sq.).

<p>As to the share which the municipalities took in this movement, opinions differ. Some authors (Uhlhorn, Ratzinger) hold that in most cases the city hospital was founded and endowed by the city authorities; while others (Lallemand, II, 51) declare that between the twelfth and the sixteenth centuries, comparatively few foundations were made by the municipality, though this often seconded private initiative with lands and subventions and willingly took over the direction of hospitals once they were established. It is however beyond question that the control of the hospitals passed quite generally into the hands of the municipality especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. As a rule the transfer was easily effected on the basis of an agreement between the superior and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, e.g. Lindau, 1307; Lucerne, 1319; Frankfort, 1283; Cologne, 1321. In certain cases where dispute arose as to the observance of the agreement, the matter was referred to high <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Thus the Holy Ghost hospital at G&ouml;ttingen was given over to the municipality by order of the Council of Basle in 1470 (Uhlhorn, loc. cit.). Such transfers, it should be noted, implied no opposition to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; they simply resulted from the general development which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the authorities in each city to intervene in the management of institutions on which the public weal in large measure depended. There was no question of secularization in the modern sense of the term. Much less can it be shown that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbade clerics any share in the control of hospitals, though some modern writers have thus interpreted the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council of Vienne in 1311. In reply to Fr&egrave;re Orban (pseud., Jean Vaudamme, "La mainmorte et la charit&eacute;", Brussels, 1857), Lalletnand points out (II, 106 sq.) that what the council did prohibit was the conferring of hospitals and their administration upon <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> as <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> ("nullus ex locis ipsis s&aelig;cularibus clericis in beneficium conferatur"). The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was aimed at an abuse which diverted hospital funds from their original charitable purpose to the emolument of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. On the other hand, the Council of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> in the same year (1311), considering the waste and malversation of hospital revenues, ordered that the management, supervision, and control of these institutions should be given exclusively to religious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the movement in favour of secular control advanced much more slowly. <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">King Philip Augustus</a> in 1200 decreed that all hospitals and hospital funds should be administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or some other ecclesiastic. The Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1212) took measures to reduce the number of attendants in the hospitals which, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> declared, were meant for the service of the sick and not for the benefit of those in good health. At the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (1260) it was enacted, in view of prevalent abuses, that hospitals should be placed under <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> and conducted by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who would "Lead a community life, present annual reports of their administration and retain for themselves nothing beyond food and clothing" (can. 13). Similar decrees were issued by the <a href="../cathen/02159a.htm">Council of Avignon</a> (1336). But the protests of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were of little avail against growing disorders. Even the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which in the main had been well managed, began in the fifteenth century, to suffer from grave abuses. After various attempts at reform, the chapter of Notre-Dame requested the municipal authorities to take over the administration of the hospital (April, 1505). Accordingly a board composed of eight <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, delegates of the municipality, was appointed and, with the approval of the court, assumed charge of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu (Lallemand, II, 112).
<h3>Great Britain and Ireland</h3>

<p>In these countries the care of the sick, like other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, was for a long time entrusted to the monastic orders. Each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, taking its pattern from those on the Continent, provided for the treatment both of its own inmates who fell ill and of infirm <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the neighbourhood. In the Penitential of Theodore (668-690) we read (VI, 15): "in potestate et libertate est monasterii susceptio infirmorum in monasterium", i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is free to receive the sick. According to Harduin (IV, 864) a large hospital was founded at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a> in 794. A little later (796) <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> writing to Eanbald II, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, exhorts him to have in mind the foundation of hospitals where the poor and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> may find admission and relief (Haddan and Stubbs, "Councils", Oxford, 1871, III, 504). The temporal rulers also were generous in this respect. In 936 King Athelstan returning from his successful campaign against the Scots, made certain grants to the Culdees or secular canons of St. Peter's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, which they employed to found a hospital. This was known at first as St. Peter's, afterwards as St. Leonard's from the name of the church built in the hospital by King Stephen. It provided for 206 <a href="../cathen/02383b.htm">bedesmen</a> and was served by a master, thirteen brethren, four seculars, eight sisters, thirty choristers, and six Servites. <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Archbishop Lanfranc</a> in 1084 founded the hospital of St. Gregory outside the north gate of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and endowed it with lands and other revenues. It was a large house, built of stone and divided into two sections, one for men and the other for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>During the first quarter of the twelfth century (1123 ?), St. Bartholomew's hospital was founded by Rahere, who had been jester of Henry I, but had joined a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community and secured from the king a grant of land in Smoothfield near London. This continued to be the most prominent hospital of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> until its confiscation by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. The Holy Cross hospital at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> was founded in 1132 by Henry of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, half-brother to King Stephen; St. Mary's Spital, in 1197 by Walter Brune, citizen of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and his wife Roesia. The latter, at the Dissolution, had 180 beds for sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and travellers. In 1215 Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, established St. Thomas's hospital in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. This also was confiscated by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> but was re-established by Edward VI. At the present time St. Bartholomew's and St. Thomas's are among the most important hospitals in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. The list of foundations in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is a long one; Tanner in his "Notiti&aelig;" mentions 460. For their charters and other documents see Dugdale, "Monasticon Anglicanum", new ed., London, 1846, VI, pt. 2. That these institutions were under episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is clear from the enactment of the Council of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> (1217): "those who desire to found a hospital must receive from us its rules and regulations" (Wilkins, I, 583). Nevertheless, abuses crept in, so that in the "Articles on Reform" sent by <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford University</a> to Henry V in 1414, complaint is made that the poor and sick are cast out of the hospitals and left unprovided for, while the masters and overseers appropriate to themselves the revenues (Wilkins, III, 365).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 77 hospitals were founded before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; Glasgow had two, Aberdeen four, Edinburgh five. St. Mary Magdalen's at Roxburgh was founded by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> I (1124-1153); <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> at Soltre by King Malcolm IV (1153-1163); the one at Rothean by John Bisset about 1226; Hollywood in Galloway by Robert Bruce's brother Edward (died 1318); St. Mary Magdalen's at Linlithgow by James I (1424-1437). To the three existing hospitals at <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, Bishop Gavin Dunbar (1518-1532) added a fourth. The foundations at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> have already been mentioned under <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">EDINBURGH</a>. "The form of the hospital was generally similar to that of the church; the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> formed the common room, the beds were placed in the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, and the whole was screened off from the eastern end of the building, where was the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> . . . . The hospitals were usually in charge of a warder or master, assisted by nurses. There was a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> on the staff, and the inmates were bound to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> daily for their founders and benefactors." (Bellesheim, "History of the Catholic Church in Scotland", <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 1887, II, 185, 417; cf. Walcot, "The Ancient Church of Scotland", London, 1874).

<p>The existence of numerous hospitals in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is attested by the names of towns such as Hospital, Spital, Spiddal, etc. The hospital was known as <em>forus tuaithe</em> i.e. the house of the territory, to indicate that it cared for the sick in a given district. The <a href="../cathen/02753a.htm">Brehon Laws</a> provide that the hospital shall be free from <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, shall have four doors, and there must be a stream of water running through the middle of the floor (Laws, I, 131). Dogs and fools and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> scolds must be kept away from the patient lest he be worried (ibid.). Whoever <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> inflicted bodily injury on another had to pay for his maintenance either in a hospital or in a private house. In case the wounded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> went to a hospital, his mother, if living and available, was to go with him (ibid., III, 357; IV, 303, 333; see also Joyce, "A Social History of Ancient Ireland", London, 1903, I, 616 sq.). In the later development, the Knights of St. John had a number of hospitals, the most important of which was Kilmainham Priory founded about 1174 by Richard Strongbow. Other commanderies were located at Killhill, at Hospital near Emly in Co. Limerick, at Kilsaran in Co. Louth, and at Wexford. Towards the end of the twelfth century, the establishments of the <a href="../cathen/04557a.htm">Crutched Friars</a> or Cross-bearers, were to be found in various parts of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; at <a href="../cathen/08615a.htm">Kells</a> was the hospital of St. John Baptist founded (1189-1199) by Walter de Lacie, Lord of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>; at Ardee, the one founded in 1207 by Roger de Pippard, Lord of Ardee, the charter of which was confirmed by Eugene, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>; at Dundalk, the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> established by Bertrand de Verdon, which afterwards became a hospital for both sexes. The hospital of St. John Baptist at Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, known as "Teach Eoin" was founded in 1200 by Theobald Walter, First Butler of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. St. Mary's hospital at Drogheda, Co. Louth, owed its origin (thirteenth century) to Ursus de Swemele, Eugene, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, being a witness to the charter. The hospital of St. Nicholas at <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a> with fourteen beds and three <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> was founded by Sir David Latimer, Seneschal to Marian, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a> (1224-123S). In 1272 the hospital was joined to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey in the neighbourhood. In or near Dublin ample provision was made for the care of the sick. About 1220, Henry Loundres, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, founded a hospital in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and St. James in a place called the Steyne, near the city of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and endowed it with lands and revenues. The Priory of St. John Baptist was situated in St. Thomas Street, without the west gate of the city. About the end of the twelfth century, Ailred de Palmer founded a hospital here for the sick. In 1361, it appearing that the hospital supported 115 sick poor, <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">King Edward III</a> granted it the <em>deodanda</em> for twenty years. This grant was renewed in 1378 and in 1403. About 1500, Walter, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, granted a void space of ground to build thereon a stone house for ten poor men. On 8 June, 1504, John Allen, then dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, founded the said hospital for sick poor, to be chosen principally out of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Allen, Barret, Begge, Hill, Dillon, and Rodier, in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a> and Dublin; and to be faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of good fame, and honest conversation; he assigned lands for their support and maintenance, and further endowed the hospital with a message in the town of Duleek, in the County of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a> (Archdall, "Monasticon Hibernicum", London, 1786). At the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> all these funds and charities became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<p>The famines and pestilence, which scourged these countries during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> called into existence a considerable number of institutions, in particular the leper-houses. This name, however, was often given to hospitals which cared for ordinary patients as well as for those stricken with the plague. What was originally opened as a leper-house and, as a rule, endowed for that purpose, naturally became, as the epidemic subsided, a general hospital. There were some leper-hospitals in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but it is not easy to distinguish them in every case from general hospitals for the sick poor. Thus the hospital built by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Innisfallen in 869 is merely called nosocomium although it is usually reckoned an early foundation for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. A hospital at Waterford was "confirmed to the poor" by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> in 1185. St. Stephen's in Dublin (1344) is specially named as the residence of the "poor lepers of the city", in a deed gift of about 1360-70; a locality of the city called Leper-hill was perhaps the site of another refuge. Lepers also may have been the occupants of the hospitals at Kilbixy in Westmeath (St. Bridget's), of St. Mary Magdalene's at Wexford (previous to 1408), of the house at "Hospital", Lismore (1467), at Downpatrick, at Kilclief in County Down, at <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>, and of one or more of four old hospitals in or near <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>. The hospital at <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> built "for the poor of the town" about 1543, was not a leper-house, nor is there reason to take the old hospital at Dungarran as a foundation specially for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>" (Creighton, "A History of Epidemics in Britain", Cambridge, 1891, p. 100).
<h3>Action of the papacy</h3>

<p>Innumerable pontifical documents attest the interest and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in behalf of hospitals. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> extends its favour and protection to the charitable undertakings of the faithful in order to ensure their success and to shield them against molestation from any source. It grants the hospital permission to have a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, and a cemetery of its own: exempts the hospital from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, making it <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; approves <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, intervenes to correct abuses, defends the hospitals <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and compels the restitution of its holdings where these have been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> alienated or seized. In particular, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> are liberal in granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, e.g. to the founders and patrons, to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the hospital <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> or cemetery, to all who contribute when an appeal is made for the support of the hospital, and to all who lend their services in nursing the sick (Lallemand, op. cit., III, 92 sq.; Uhlhorn, op. cit., II, 224).
<h3>Character of the medieval hospitals</h3>

<p>It is not possible to give any account in detail that would accurately describe each and all these institutions; they differed too widely in size, equipment, and administration. The one common feature was the endeavour to do the best possible for the sick under given circumstances; this naturally brought about improvement, now in one respect now in another, as time went on. Certain fundamental requisites, however, were kept in view throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Care was taken in many instances to secure a good location, the bank of a river being preferred; the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was on the Seine, Santo Spirito at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the Tiber, St. Francis at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, on the Moldau, the hospitals at Mains and <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, on the Rhine, that at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, on the Danube. In some cases, as at Fossanova and Beaune, a water-course passed beneath the building. Many of the hospitals, particularly the smaller ones, were located in the central portion of the city or town within easy reach of the poorer classes. Others again, like Santa Maria Nuova in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> and a good number of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> hospitals, were built outside the city walls for the express purpose of providing better air for the inmates and of preventing the spread of infectious and contagious diseases of all kinds.

<p>As regards construction, it should be noted that many of the hospitals accommodated but a small number of patients (seven, fifteen, or twenty-flve), the limit being usually determined by the founder or benefactor: in such cases a private dwelling sufficed or at most a building of modest dimensions. But where ampler endowment was provided the hospital was planned by able architects and constructed on a larger scale. The main ward at santo Spirito, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was 409 ft. in length by 40 ft. in width; at Tonnerre, 260 ft. by 60; at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, 195 ft. by 72; at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 180 ft. by 52; at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 130 ft. by 40; at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, 117 ft. by 42. In hospitals of this type, an abundant supply of light and air was furnished by large windows, the upper parts of which were immovable while the lower could be opened or closed. To these, in some cases (Santo Spirito, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), was added a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> which rose from the middle of the ceiling and was supported by graceful columns. The interior was decorated with niches, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, and armorial bearings; in fact the same artistic skill that so richly adorned the churches was employed to beautify the hospital wards. The hospital at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> "constitutes almost as striking a bit of architecture as any edifice of the period and contains a magnificent set of frescoes, some of them of the fourteenth century, many others of later centuries" (Gardner, "Story of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>", London, 1902). The hospital founded (1293) at Tonnerre in Prance by Margaret of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, a sister-in-law of St. Louis, combined many advantages. It was situated between the branches of a small stream, and its main ward, with arched ceiling of wood, was lighted by large pointed windows high up in the walls. At the level of the window sills, some twelve feet from the floor, a narrow gallery ran along the wall from which the ventilation might be regulated and on which convalescent patients might walk or be seated in the sun. The beds were separated by low partitions which secured privacy but could be moved aside so as to allow the patients to attend Mass said at an altar at the end of the ward. This arrangement of a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in connexion with the principal ward was adopted in many establishments; but the alcove system was not so frequently met with, the beds being placed, as a rule, in several rows in the one large open hall.

<p>Hospital construction reached a high degree of perfection about the middle of the fifteenth century. Probably the best example of it is the famous hospital at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, opened in 1445, though not completed until the close of the fifteenth century. Dr. W. Gill Wylie in his Boylston Prize Essay on Hospitals says of it: "In 1456 the Grand Hospital of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was opened. This remarkable building is still in use as a hospital and contains usually more than 2000 patients. The buildings stand around square yards, the principal one being much larger than the others, and separating the hospital into two parts. The main wards on either side of this large court form a cross, in the centre of which was a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, with an altar beneath it, where divine service is performed daily in sight of the patients. These wards have corridors on both sides which are not so lofty as the ceilings of the wards, and consequently there is plenty of room for windows above these passages. The ceilings are thirty or forty feet high, and the floors covered with red bricks or flags. The outside wards are nothing but spacious corridors. The wards are first warmed by open charcoal brasiers. . . . This Hospital built at the time when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was at the height of her power, and but a short time before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, is a good example of what had been attained toward the development of hospitals and it shows how much a part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the institution of hospitals was."

<p>The administration of the hospital when this formed part of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, was naturally in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or prior and the details were prescribed in the monastic rule. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> also of the hospital orders (<a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>) regulated minutely the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the "Commander", who was at the head of each hospital. In other institutions, the official in charge was known as <em>magister</em>, <em>provisor</em>, or <em><a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a></em>, this last title being given in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to the superior in case he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, while in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he was called <em>spedalingo</em>. These officials were appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the chapter, or the municipality, sometimes by the founder or patron. Laymen as well as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were eligible; in fact, legacies were sometimes made to a hospital on condition that only lay directors should have control, as, for instance, in the case of St. Matthew's at Pavia.

<p>The regulations most generally adopted were those of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Order of St. John of Jerusalem</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> and that of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were also observed in many institutions. The first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or magister was to take an inventory of the hospital holdings and appurtenances; he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to begin this within a month after his appointment and to finish it within a year. Besides the general superintendence of the hospital, he was responsible for the accounts and for the whole financial administration, including the properties of the hospital itself and the deposits of money which are often entrusted to him for safekeeping. It was also his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to receive each patient and assign him to his proper place in the hospital.

<p>The brothers and sisters were bound by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience which they took at the hands of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or, as at Coventry (England), at the hands of the prior and chapter. As in all religious establishments, the schedule of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> was strictly prescribed, as were also the details of dress, food, and recreation. No one employed in the hospital was allowed to go out unaccompanied, to spend the night, or take any refreshment other than water outside the hospital. Penalties were inflicted for violation of these rules.

<p>In the reception of patients, the broadest possible charity was shown. As Coyecque (op. cit., I, p. 63) says of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>: "soldiers and citizens, religious and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, repaired in case of need to the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, and all were admitted, for all bore the marks of poverty and wretchedness; there was no other requirement." Moreover, the hospital attendants were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> at stated times to go out into the streets and bring in those who needed treatment. On entering the hospital, the patient, if a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, went to confession and received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, in order that peace of mind might benefit bodily health. Once admitted, he was to be treated as the master of the house &mdash; <em>quasi dominus secundum posse domus</em>, as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> enact. According to their ability, the sick performed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, attendance at Mass, and reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. They were especially recommended to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their benefactors, for the authorities, and for all who might be in distress. At night-fall a sort of <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> was recited in the wards, each verse of which began: "Seignors malades, proies por", etc. They were often cheered by the visits of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in high station or of noble rank and charitable disposition, like <a href="../cathen/03448a.htm">Catherine of Sweden</a>, Margaret, Queen of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, Margaret, Duchess of Lorraine, <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The regulations concerning the physical well-being of the inmates prescribed that the sick should never be left without an attendant &mdash; <em>inflrmi autem nunquam sint sine vigili custodia</em> (Amiens, XXXV); that nurses should be on <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> at all hours of the day and night; that when the illness became serious the patient should be removed from the ward to a private room and receive special attention (Paris, XXII; Troyes, I, XXXIII; Vernon, XI). Santa Maria Nuova at Florence had a separate section (<em>pazzeria</em>) for delirious patients. Similar provision was made for maternity cases, and the patients were kept in the hospital for three weeks after parturition. That due attention was paid to cleanliness and comfort is evident from what the records tell of baths, bed-linens, ventilation, and heating by means of fireplaces or braziers.

<p>The medical treatment was given by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> &mdash; at least during the earlier period. From the twelfth century onward restrictions were placed on the practice of medicine by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, especially in regard to surgical operations, and with still greater severity, in regard to the acceptance of fees for attendance on the sick; see the decrees of the councils: Clermont (1130), can. v; <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1131), can. vi; Second Lateran (1139), can. ix; Fourth Lateran (1215), can. xviii. At times a physician or surgeon was called in to render special assistance in certain cases; and this became more general as the medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> developed, as at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> and <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. An important document is the report sent in 1524 from <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Nuova in Florence to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, who, with a view to reorganizing the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> hospitals, had sought information regarding the famous Florentine institution. From this it appears that three young physicians were resident (<em>adstantes</em>) in the hospital, in constant attendance on the sick and made a daily report on the condition of each patient to six visiting physicians from the city who gave prescriptions or ordered modifications in the treatment. Attached to the hospital was a dispensary (<em>medicinarium</em>) for the treatment of ulcers and other slight ailments. This was conducted by the foremost surgeon of the city and three assistants, who gave their services gratuitously to the needy townsfolk and supplied them with remedies from the hospital pharmacy. An interesting account of the apothecary's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, with a list of the drugs at his disposal, is given by Lallemand in his interesting work, "L'Histoire de la Charit&eacute;" (II, 225).

<p>To meet its expenses, each hospital had its own endowment in the shape of lands, sometimes of whole villages, farms, vineyards, and forests. Its revenues were often increased by special taxes on such products as oil, wheat, and salt; by regular contributions from charitable associations; and by the income from churches under its control. In many instances the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> each of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially the canons, to contribute to the support of the hospital. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> also gave liberally either to the general purposes of the hospital or to supply some special need, such as heating, lighting, or providing for the table. It was not uncommon for a benefactor to donate one or more beds or to establish a life annuity which secured him care and treatment. The generosity of the hospital and its patrons was frequently abused, e.g. by malingerers or tramps (<em>validi vagrantes</em>), and stricter rules concerning admission became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. In some cases the number of attendants was excessive, in others the hospital was unable to provide a separate bed for each patient. In spite of these drawbacks, "we have much to learn from the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> &mdash; much that we, with far more abundant means, can emulate for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of man as well" (Virchow, "Abhandl.", II, 16).
<h2>Post-Reformation period</h2>

<p>The injury inflicted upon the whole system of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities by the upheaval of the sixteenth century, was disastrous in many ways to the work of the hospitals. The dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, deprived the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in large measure of the means to support the sick and of the organization through which those means had been employed. Similar spoliations in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> followed so rapidly on the introduction of the new religion that the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> themselves found it difficult to provide anything like a substitute for the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> foundations. Even <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> confessed more than once that under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> generous provision had been made for all classes of suffering, while among his own followers no one contributed to the maintenance of the sick and the poor (S&auml;mmtl. Werke, XIV, 389-390; XIII, 224-225). As a result, the hospitals in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> countries were rapidly secularized, though efforts were not wanting, on the part of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and municipality, to provide funds for charitable purposes (Uhlhorn, III).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> meanwhile, though deprived of its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> revenues, took energetic measures to restore and develop the hospital system. The <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> J. L. Viv&egrave;s (De subventione pauperum, Bruges, 1526) declared that by Divine ordinance each must eat his bread after earning it by the sweat of his brow, that the magistrates should ascertain by census who among the citizens are able to work and who are really helpless. For the hospitals in particular, Viv&egrave;s urges strict economy in their administration, better provision for medical attendance and a fairer apportionment of available funds whereby the surplus of the wealthier institutions should be assigned to the poorer. Viv&egrave;s's plan was first put into execution at Ypres in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and then extended by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to his entire empire (1531).

<p>Still more decisive was the action taken by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> which renewed the decrees of Vienne and furthermore <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that every <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> charged with the administration of a hospital should be held to a strict account and, in case of inefficiency or irregularity in the use of funds, should not only be subject to <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a> but should also be removed from office and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make restitution (Session XXV, c. viii, De Reform.). The most important, however, of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees was that which placed the hospital under episcopal control and proclaimed the right of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to visit each institution in order to see that it is properly managed and that every one connected with it discharges his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> faithfully (Session XXII, c. viii, De Reform.; Session VII, c. xv, De Reform.). These wise enactments were repeated by provincial and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In giving them practical effect <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> set the example by founding and endowing a hospital at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and by <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> hospital directors to submit reports of their administration. He also determined the conditions for the admission of patients in such wise as to exclude undeserving applicants (First Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, part III, c. i, in Harduin, X, 704). At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the principal foundations during this period were: the hospital established by the Benfratelli in 1581 on the island in the Tiber where the &AElig;sculapium of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had stood; the hospital for poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> founded by a charitable <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, Giovanni Vestri (died 1650); that of Lorenzo in Fonte (1624) for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had spent at least fourteen years in the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; that of San Gallicano for skin diseases, erected by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in 1726.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the control of the hospitals had already passed into the hands of the sovereign. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> established in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a special hospital for almost every need &mdash; invalids, convalescents, incurables etc., besides the vast "hospital general" for the poor. But he withstood the efforts of the episcopate to put in force the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees regarding the superintendence and visitation of the hospitals. On the other hand, this period is remarkable for the results accomplished by <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and especially by the community which he founded to care for the poor sick, the Sisters of Charity. Since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, indeed, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have taken a more prominent part than ever in the care of the sick; over a hundred <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders or congregations have been established for this purpose (see list in Andr&eacute;-Wagner, "Dict. de droit canonique", Paris, 1901, II, s.v. Hospitaliers; also articles on the different orders in THE CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA).

<p>A noteworthy attempt at reform during the eighteenth century was that of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under Louis XVI. This hospital, which usually had 2400 patients and at times 5000, had long suffered from overcrowding, poor ventilation, and neglect of the patients. To remedy these defects, a commission was appointed including Tenon, <a href="../cathen/09052a.htm">Lavoisier</a>, and Laplace. The principal recommendation contained in their report (1788) was the adoption of the pavilion system modelled on that of the hospital at <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1764). The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, however, intervened and it was only during the nineteenth century that the needed improvements were introduced. In the other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries, meanwhile, there had been many new foundations: in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Westminster (1719), Guy's (1722), St. George's (1733); in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Charit&eacute; at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> established by Frederick I (1710) and the hospital at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, by Bishop Franz Ludwig von Erthal (1789); in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the General Hospital at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, promoted by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, 1784.

<p>The first hospital was erected before 1524 in the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a> by <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>, in gratitude, as he declared in his will, "for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and mercies <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had bestowed on him in permitting him to discover and conquer New Spain and in expiation or satisfaction for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he had committed, especially those that he had forgotten, or any burden these might be on his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> for which he could not make special atonement". It was called the Hospital de la Pur&iacute;sima Concepci&oacute;n, later of Jesus Nazareno, after a neighbouring shrine. It is still in existence and its superintendents are appointed by the descendants of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>, the Dukes of Terranova y Monteleon. <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 16 April, 1529, conferred on <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a> the perpetual patronage of this and other similar institutions to be founded by him. Within the first decade after the Conquest, the Hospital of San Lazaro was founded with accommodation for 400 patients, and the Royal Hospital, also in the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">city of Mexico</a>, was established by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1540. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1541 ordered hospitals to be erected in all Spanish and Indian towns (Bancroft, "Hist. of Mexico", II, 169; III, 759). The First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> (1583) and the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Mexico (1585) decreed that each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should contribute the twelfth part of his income to the hospital (D'Aiguirre, "Concil. Hispan.", IV, 246, 355). The Brothers of St. Hippolytus &mdash; a congregation established in 1585 by Bernardin Alvarez, a citizen of Mexico, and approved by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> in 1594 &mdash; devoted themselves to the care of the sick and erected numerous hospitals. The <a href="../cathen/02534b.htm">Bethlehemites</a>, founded by Pedro de Betancourt (died 1667) and approved by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> in 1673, spread from <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a> over nearly the whole of Latin America, and rendered excellent service by their hospital work until their suppression, as well as all other religious in Mexico, in 1820.
<h3>Canada</h3>

<p>The earliest foundation was that of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu by the <a href="../cathen/01233e.htm">Duchess of Aiguillon</a>. This was established in 1639 at Sillery, and later transferred to Quebec, where it is still in charge of the Hospitali&egrave;res de la Mis&eacute;ricorde de J&eacute;sus. The H&ocirc;tel-Dieu at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> was founded in 1644 by <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a>; the General Hospital at Quebec in 1693. There are at present eighty-seven hospitals in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> under the control and direction of various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities.

<p>The first hospital in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was erected on Manhattan Island about 1663 "at the request of Surgeon Hendricksen Varrevanger for the reception of sick soldiers who had been previously billeted on private <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and for the West <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Company's <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>" (Callaghan, "New Netherland Register"). Pesthouses for contagious diseases were established at New York, Salem (Mass.), and Charleston early in the eighteenth century. In 1717 a hospital for infectious diseases was built at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. A charter was granted for the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Hospital in 1751: the cornerstone was laid in 1755, but the structure was not completed until 1805. The first hospital established by private beneficence was the Charity Hospital at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, for the founding of which (about 1720) Jean Louis, a sailor, afterwards an officer in the Company of the Indies, left 12,000 livres. This was destroyed by the hurricane of 1779. The New Charity Hospital (San Carlos) was founded in 1780 and endowed by Don Andres de Almonester y Roxas: it became the City Hospital in 1811. Still in charge of the Sisters of Charity, it is one of the most important hospitals in the country, receiving annually about 8000 patients. The oldest hospital in the City of New York is the New York Hospital, founded in 1770 by private subscriptions and by contributions from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. It received from the Provincial Assembly an allowance of &pound;800 for twenty years, and from the State Legislature (1795) an annual allowance of &pound;4000, increased in 1796 to &pound;5000. Bellevue Hospital, originally the infirmary of the New York City Alms House, was erected on its present site in 1811. St. Vincent's Hospital was opened in 1849; the present buildings were erected 1856-60, and accommodation provided for 140 patients. The average annual number of patients exceeds 5000. There are now more than four hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hospitals in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> which care for about half a million patients annually.

<p>The multiplication of hospitals in recent times, especially during the nineteenth century, is due to a variety of causes. First among these is the growth of industry and the consequent expansion of city population. To meet the needs of the labouring classes larger hospital facilities have been provided, associations have created funds to secure proper care for sick members, and in some countries (e.g. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>) the insurance of workingmen, as prescribed by law, enables them in case of illness to receive hospital treatment. Another important factor is the advance of medical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, bringing with it the necessity of clinical instruction. In this respect the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> have exerted a wholesome influence: no course in medicine is possible at the present time without that practical training which is to be had in the hospital. Conversely, the efficiency of the hospital has been enhanced by numerous discoveries pertaining to hygiene, <a href="../cathen/01447b.htm">an&aelig;sthetic</a> and antiseptic measures, contagion and infection. The experience of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> has also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> beneficial. The lessons learned in the Crimea and in the American Civil War have been applied to hospital construction, and have led to the adoption of the pavilion system. The modern battlefield, moreover, has been the occasion of bringing out in new strength and beauty the spirit of self-sacrifice which animates the hospital orders of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The services rendered by the sisters to the wounded and dying are conspicuous <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity which from the beginning has striven by all possible means to alleviate human suffering. The hospital of today owes much to scientific progress, generous endowment, and wise administration; but none of these can serve as a substitute for the unselfish work of the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who minister to the sick as to the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself.
