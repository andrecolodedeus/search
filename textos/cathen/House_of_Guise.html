<h1>House of Guise</h1>  

<p>The House of Guise, a branch of the ducal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Lorraine, played an important part in the religious troubles of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the seventeenth century. By reason of descent from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, it laid claim for a brief period to the throne of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Guises upheld firmly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests not only in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where Marie de Lorraine and her daughter, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, were allied to them. Their religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, however, was often tarnished by their own <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and by that of their partisans; it also covered certain plans for political reform that were dangerous to monarchical centralization. Finally, the relations which existed for thirty-five years between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the House of Guise roused the suspicion of French patriotism. In their favour it must be said that the Huegonots were also guilty of many acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and appealed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as the Guises did to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> nobility was even more dangerous to French unity than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. We shall here consider only those members of this famous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who are especially interesting from the viewpoint of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>.

<h2 id="i">Claude de Lorraine</h2>

<p>First Duke of Guise, born at the Ch&acirc;teau de Cond&eacute;, 20 Oct., 1496; d. at Joinville, 12 April, 1550, the son of Ren&eacute; II, Duke of Lorraine, and his second wife, Philippa of Guelders. Claude de Guise wished to possess the Duchy of Lorraine, to the detriment of his elder brother Antoine, whom he declared <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>, inasmuch as he was born during the lifetime of Marguerite d'Harcourt, the (divorced) first wife of Ren&eacute; II, but he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be content with the Countships of Guise and Aumale, the Barony of Joinville, and the Seigniories of Mayenne and Elbeuf, which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> possessed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He soon made his appearance at the French court, where he at once gave evidence of his ability to please. He followed <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and at the battle of Marignano (1515) received twenty-two wounds. He took a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> part in the campaigns against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, for which <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> rewarded him by making him master of the hounds and first chamberlain, and by the erection of the countship of Guise to a ducal peerage, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> hitherto reserved for princes of the blood. Claude de Guise also merited the gratitude of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party for the struggle which he maintained in 1525 against the bands of <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> attempted to invade Lorraine, whom he exterminated at Lupstein near Saverne (Zabern), 16 May, 1525. His campaign in Luxembourg (1542), the services which he rendered in 1543 by his defence of Landrecies, and his success in quieting the Parisians, alarmed by the approach of the imperial forces, justified the favour of the king, who finally confided to him the government of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; the Duke's <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, however, his large fortune, and powerful relatives gave offense to <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. It was said that the latter counseled Henry II never to admit the Guises to a share in government, and a popular quatrain current in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> ran:&mdash; <blockquote> Fran&ccedil;ois premier pr&eacute;dit ce point <br>Que ceux de la maison de Guise <br>Mettraient ses enfants en purpoint <br>Et son pauvre peuple en chemise. </blockquote>

<p>In 1513 Claude de Guise married Antoinette de Bourbon (1493-1583), noted for the simplicity of her life, her renunciation of all rich materials in dress, and her great charity toward <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. By her he had eight sons and four daughters. If the memoirs of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise, Claude's son, are to be credited, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died of poison.

<h2 id="ii">Jean de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Brother of the above, b. 1498; d. 18 May, 1550. He became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at twenty, the first <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of Lorraine. His activity was exercised chiefly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he assisted Claude de Guise to strengthen the ascendancy of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Having been sent in 1536 as the ambassador of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to reconcile their differences, he warned the king on his return of the unmistakably warlike intentions of the emperor. Even before Claude de Guise had offended the king, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was regarded with suspicion. He fell into disgrace with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in 1542, but still retained great influence owing to the bounties which he was able to make with his immense revenues, for he had acquired the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, Th&eacute;rouanne, <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">Lu&ccedil;on</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, the Archbishoprics of Lyon, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and Narbonne, and a number of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. "Thou art either Christ or the Cardinal of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>", exclaimed a Roman beggar on whom he had bestowed large <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<h2 id="iii">Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Second Duke of Guise, b. at the Ch&acirc;teau de Bar, 17 Feb., 1519, of Claude de Guise and Antoinette de Bourbon; d. 24 Feb., 1563. He was the warrior of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, <em>el gran capitan de Guysa</em>, as the Spanish called him. A wound which he received at the siege of Boulogne (1545), won for him the surname <em>Balafr&eacute;</em> (the Scarred). His defense of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1552) <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. After a siege of two months the emperor was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire with a loss of 30,000 men. Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine fought valiantly at the battle of Renty (1554). The Truce of Vaucelles, signed in 1556 for a period of six years, followed by the abdication of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, seemed about to end his military career.



<p>The dukes of Guise, however, as descendants of the House of Anjou, had certain pretensions to the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and it was doubtless with the secret intention of defending these claims that Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine furthered an alliance between Henry II and <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a> which was menaced by Philip II. In consequence of this alliance Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise entered <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> territory (Jan., 1557), marched thence through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and although neither the petty princes nor the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave him the assistance he expected, he took the little <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> town of Campli (17 April, 1557), and on 24 April laid siege to Civitella. At the end of twenty-two days, being threatened at the same time by epidemic and the <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a>, he fell back upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he reorganized his army, and was preparing to return southward, when Henry II, after the victory of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> over the Constable de Montmorency at Saint-Quentin (23 Aug., 1557), summoned him to "restore <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>".

<p>Guise returned to court (20 Oct., 1557) and was invested with the title of lieutenant-general of the kingdom. He captured the city of Calais (1-8 January, 1558) by taking into account the plans of attack drawn up by Coligny. In June he took Thionville, in July, Arlon. He was about to attack Luxemburg when he was halted by the peace of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis (3 April, 1559), concluded by Henry II, despite the protests of the duke. Moreover, Henry was on the point of disgracing Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise, at the insistence of Diana of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and the Constable de Montmorency.

<p>The accession of Francis II (10 July, 1559), however, and his consort, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, niece of Fran&ccedil;ois d Guise, was a triumph for the Guise <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the Constable de Montmorency was disgraced. "Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise was supreme in the royal council. "My advice", he would say, "is so-and-so; we must act thus." Occasionally he signed public acts in the royal manner, with his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> only. At the investigation of Antoine* de Bourbon and the Prince de Cond&eacute;, La Renaudie, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> gentlemen of P&eacute;rigord, organized a plot to seize the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise and his brother, the second <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of Lorraine. The plot was discovered (conspiracy of Amboise, 1560) and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> suppressed. Cond&eacute; was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee the court, and the power of the Guises was increased. The discourse which Coligny, leader of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, pronounced against them in the Assembly of the notables at Fountainbleau (August, 1560), did not influence Francis II in the least, but resulted rather in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of Cond&eacute;. The king, however, died, 5 December, 1560&mdash;a year full of calamity for the Guises both in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (see below, VI. Mary of Guise). Within a few months their influence waxed great and waned. After the accession of Charles, IX, Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise lived in retirement on his estates. The regent, <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a>, at first inclined to favour the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and to save the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise formed with his old enemy, the Constable de Montmorency and the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Saint-Andr&eacute; the so-called triumvirate (April, 1561), hostile to the policy of concession which <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a> attempted to inaugurate in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The plan of the Triumvirate was to treat with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and also to come to an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to induce them to abandon the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of relieving the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestants</a>. About July, 1561, Guise wrote to this effect to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. The Colloquy of Poissy (September and October, 1561) between <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the two confessions was fruitless, and the conciliation policy of <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a> was defeated. From 15 to 18 February, 1562, Guise visited the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> at Saverne, and convinced him that if the conference at Poissy had failed, the fault was that of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. As Guise passed through Vassay on his was to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1 March, 1562), a massacre of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> took place. It is not known to what extent he was responsible for this, but it kindled the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Rouen was retaken from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> by Guise after a month's siege (October); the battle of Dreux, at which Montmorency was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and Saint-Andr&eacute; slain, was in the end turned by Guise to the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause (19 December), and Cond&eacute;, leader of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Guise was about to take Orl&eacute;ans from the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> when (18 February, 1563) he was wounded by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Poltrot de M&eacute;r&eacute;, and died six days later. "We cannot deny", wrote the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Coligny, in reference to his death, "the manifest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles of God</a>."

<p>At the suggestion of Henry II Guise has married in 1549 Anne d'Este (1531-1607), daughter of Hercule II d'Este, Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and of Ren&eacute; of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, through her mother, granddaughter of Louis XII; she had been on the point of becoming the wife of Sigismund I, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. By her Guise had six sons and one daughter. Anne held the Admiral de Coligny responsible for the death of her husband, and her interview with the admiral at <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Moulins</a> was only an apparent reconciliation. She soon married James of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> (d. 1583), by whom she had two children. She lived to see the extinction of the House of Este by the death of Alphonso II, fifth Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and to see two of her sons, Henry Duke of Guise, and the Cardinal of Guise (see below) slain at the ch&acirc;teau de Blois. "Oh great king", she cried before the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of her grandfather, Louis XII, "did you build this ch&acirc;teau that the children of your granddaughter might perish in it?" The poet <a href="../cathen/13180b.htm">Ronsard</a> sang the praises of the wife of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise, according to the fashion of the time: <blockquote>Venus la sainte en ses gr&acirc;ces habite, <br>Tous les amours logent en ses regards; <br>Pour ce, a bon droit, telle dam m&eacute;rite <br>D'avoir &eacute;t&eacute; femme de notre Mars. </blockquote>

<h2 id="iv">Charles de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Cardinal of Guise, b. at Joinville, 17 Feb., 1524; d. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 26 December 1574; appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a> in 1538, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1547, the day after the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry II, at which he had officiated. He was known at first of the Cardinal of Guise, and as the second <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine, after the death of his uncle, Jean (1550), first <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine. His protection of <a href="../cathen/12619b.htm">Rabelais</a> and <a href="../cathen/13180b.htm">Ronsard</a> and his generous foundation of the University of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1547-49) assure him a place in the history of contemporary letters; his chief importance, however, is in political and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>.

<p>The efforts of this <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to enforce his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family's</a> pretensions to the Countship of Provance, and his temporary assumption, with this object, of the title of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Anjou were without success. He failed also when he attempted, in 1551, to dissuade Henry II from uniting the Dutchy of Lorraine to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He succeeded, however, in creating for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> interests certain political alliances that occasionally seemed in conflict with each other. He coquetted, for instance, on the one hand with the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and on the other, with his interview (1558) with the <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Cardinal de Granvelle</a> (at P&eacute;ronne), he initiated friendly relations between the Guises and the royal house of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Thus the man who, as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> successively Henry II, Francis II, and Charles IX had a personal policy which was often at variance with that of the court. This policy rendered him at times an enigma to his contemporaries. The chronicler L'Estoile accused him of great duplicity; Brant&ocirc;me spoke of his "deeply stained <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchman</a> though he was", accused him of <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">skepticism</a>, and claimed to have heard him occasionally speak half approvingly of the Confession of Augsburg. He is also often held to be responsible for the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and seems now and then to have attempted to establish the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libelous</a> pamphlets aroused against him strong religious and political passions. From 1560 at least twenty-two were in circulation and fell into his hands; they damaged his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> with posterity as well as among his contemporaries. One of them, "La Guerre Cardinale" (1565), accuses him of seeking to restore to the Empire the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun, which had been conquered by Henry II. A discourse attributed to Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze (1566) denounced the pluralism of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in the matter of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>.

<p>Under Charles IX, the Cardinal of Guise constantly alternated between disgrace and favour. In 1562, he attended the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, possessing the full confidence of his royal master. Louis de Saint-G&eacute;lais, Sieur de Lansac, Arnaud du Ferrier, president of the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and Guy de Faur de Pibrac, royal counsellor, who represented Charles IX at the Council from 26 May, 1562, towards the end of the year were joined by the Cardinal Lorraine. He was instructed to arrive at an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, who proposed to reform the church in head and members and to authorize at once Communion under Both Kinds, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the vernacular, and the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the reform articles which he presented (2 Jan., 1563), he was silent on the last point, but petitioned for the other two. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> was indignant, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> denounced <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the source of all abuses. In the questions of precedence which arose between him and the Spanish ambassador, Count de Luna, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> decided for the latter. However, in September 1563, while on a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, intent perhaps on securing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> assistances for the realization of the political ambitions of the Guises, professed opinions less decided Gallican. Moreover, when he learned that the French ambassadors, who had left the council, were dissatisfied because the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> had obtained from the council approval of a project for the "reformation of the princes", which the latter deemed contrary to the liberties of the Gallican church, he endeavoured, though without success, to bring about the return of the ambassadors, prevailed on the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to withdraw the objectionable articles, and strove to secure the immediate publication in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of the decrees of the council; this, however, was refused by <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine di' Medici</a>.

<p>When, in 1566, Fran&ccedil;ois de Montmorency, governor of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and his personal enemy, attempted to prevent the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> from entering the capital with an armed escort, the ensuing conflict and the precipitate flight of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> gave rise to an outcry of derision which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to retire to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for two years. In 1570 he aroused the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of Charles IX by inducing Duke Henri, the eldest of his nephews, to solicit the hand of Margaret of Valois, the king's sister, and in 1574 he vexed the king still more when, through spite, he prevented the marriage of this princess with the king of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. His share in the negotiations for the marriage between Charles IX and Elizabeth of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and for that of Margaret Valois with the prince of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, seems to have won him some favor which, however, was but brief, for <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine di' Medici</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> only too well what a constant menace the personal policy of the Guises constituted for that of the king. Shortly after the death of Charles IX, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> appeared before his successor, Henry III, but died soon afterwards.

<h2 id="v">Louis I de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Cardinal of Guise, b. 21 Oct., 1527, d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 March, 1578, the brother of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise and of the second <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of Lorraine. He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in 1545, of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a> in 1550, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1553, under the name of Cardinal of Guise, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> in 1561, but resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in 1562, in favour of Cardinal de Pellev&eacute;e. He <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry III, 13 Feb., 1575. Contemporary witnesses do not seem to agree with regard to him. L'Estoile calls him a merry gourmet, <em>le cardinal des bouteilles</em>, while Brant&ocirc;me praises his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and political good sense, especially in his old age.

<h2 id="vi">Mary of Guise</h2>

<p>Queen of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, b. 22 Nov. 1515; d. at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 10 June 1560; sister of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise, and of the second <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of Lorraine, and eldest of the twelve children of Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Guise, and Antoinette de Bourbon. Left a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in 1535, after a year of married life with Louis II d'Orleans, Duke of Longueville, she refused to marry <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but at the express command of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> consented to go to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> to wed (9 May, 1538) James V, king of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, whose first wife, Margaret of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, had died a year before. By James V she had (7 or 8 Dec, 1542) one daughter, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, and a week later (14 Dec.) she became a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and regent. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> sought to take advantage of this regency to establish in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> an anti-Catholic influence, and to this end wrung from Mary of Guise the treaty of 12 March, 1543, which promised <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> in marriage to Edward, his son. Mary of Guise, however, particularly after the death of her advisor, <a href="../cathen/02372a.htm">Cardinal Beaton</a>, looked to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the support of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> policy, and it was decided by the Estates of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (5 Feb., 1548), that <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> should be sent to that country, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland's</a> oldest and most faithful ally, to be married to the young Dauphin Francis, son of Henry II. While the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> continued to progress in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, Mary de Guise, through the advice and assistance of her brothers, Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise and the second <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine, succeeded in maintaining her authority. From <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> her brothers kept her informed of the great success achieved by her daughter, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>. "She rules the king and queen", wrote the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iv">Cardinal de Lorraine</a>. On the marriage of Henry II with the Dauphin Francis, Henry II desired them to assume the titles of king and Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, alleging that Elizabeth, daughter of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, and Anne Boleyn, was ineligible, having been the child of an illegitimate marriage, also a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. The Guises hoped for a brief period that as a result of their policy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rule would be established throughout Britain. Nicholas de Bell&egrave;ve, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and several <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in 1559 to prevail upon Mary of Guise to put on trial all non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Though of a moderate temper, and though she wrote to the Guises that the only means of preserving the old religion in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> was to allow the people complete liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the queen dared not oppose the order from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. A revolt followed; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> pillaged churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and entered Edinburgh. <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a> proclaimed the right of insurrection against tyranny; and the assembly of the peers and the barons of the kingdom declared Mary of Guise deposed from the regency (21 Oct., 1559). She was then at Leith, guarded by a troop of French soldiers. They soon overcame the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> troops and she was then able to enter Edinburgh, but an English army sent by Elizabeth to the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> laid siege to <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, and at this juncture, Mary of Guise died.

<h2 id="vii">Henri I de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Prince de Joinville, and in 1563 third Duke of Guise, b. 31 Dec. 1550, the son of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise and Anne d'Este; d. at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, 23 Dec., 1588. The rumours which attributed to Coligny a share in the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise hailed in the young Henri de Guise, then thirteen years old, the avenger of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and the leader of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. While the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine retained the ascendancy and the numerous following of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the young Henri, leaving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, had no part in the patched-up reconciliation at <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Moulins</a> between his mother and Coligny. In July, 1556, he went to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to fight in the emperor's service against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. When he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he took part in the second and third <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, distinguishing himself at the battles of Saint-Denis (1567), Jarnac, Moncontour, and at the defence of Portiers (1569) against Coligny. His pretension (1570) to the hand of Margaret of Valois, sister of Charles IX, seriously offended the king, but he was restored to favour on his hastily marrying Catherine de Cl&egrave;ves (1548-1633), <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the Prince of Porcien and goddaughter of <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a>, noted for the frivolity of her youth and for the strange freedom with which she had caused her lovers to be <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in her Book of Hours as crucified.

<p>Between 1570 and 1572 Henri de Guise was much disturbed by the ascendancy of Coligny and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in the counsels of Charles IX. To similar suspicious fears, shared by <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a>, must be traced the St. Bartholomew massacre. Guise was accused of having given the impulse by stationing Maurevers (22 Aug., 1572) on the route taken by Coligny, and when the next day <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a> insisted that, in order to forestall an outbreak of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> vengeance, Charles IX should order the death of several of their chiefs, Guise was summoned to the palace to arrange for the execution of the plan. For the massacre and the deplorable proportions its assumed, see <a href="../cathen/13333b.htm">SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY</a>. during the night of 24 August, Henri de Guise, with a body of armed men, went to Coligny's dwelling, and while his attendants slew Coligny, he waited on horseback in the courtyard and cried, "Is he quite dead?" In repelling the repeated attacks of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> at the battle of Dormans (10 Oct. 1575) during the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, Henri received a wound on the cheek which led to his being thenceforth known, like his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, as <em>Le Balafr&eacute;</em>. His power increased, and he was regarded as a second <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>. His popularity was now so great that a contemporary wrote, "It is too little to say that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with that man; she was bewitched by him."

<p>King Henry III began to feel that his own safety was threatened, the powerful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was beginning to aspire to the throne. In 1576 the Holy League was organized, centered at once about the popular hero, Henri de Guise, and in a few months had at its disposal 26,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry. The object of the League was to defend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Still earlier at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1563), Angers (1565), Dijon (1567), <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and Troyes (1568), <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leagues had been formed, composed of loyal and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> middle class citizens. In 1576, however, the Holy League was established among the nobility and, according to a declaration spread throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Guise, this association of princes, lords, and gentlemen had a twofold purpose: (1) to establish in its fullness the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>; to restore and maintain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> holy service according to the form and manner of the Holy, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Apostolic, and Roman church; to preserve king Henry III in the state of splendour, authority, <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, and obedience owed to him by his subjects, but with the proviso that nothing shall be done to the prejudice of what may be enjoined by the States-General. (2) To restore to the provinces and states of the realm, under the protection of the League, their ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, pre-eminence, franchises and liberties such as they have been from the time of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> king, and as much better and more profitable, if improvement were possible, as they could be made under the protection of the League. From the beginning, therefore, a decentralizing as well as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> tendency characterized the League.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> soon pretended to have discovered among the papers of one Jean David that the Guises had forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a memoir claiming that, by reason of their descent from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Henry III should yield them the throne of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The League was first organized in Picardy, under the direction of the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Humi&eacute;res, governor of P&eacute;ronne, Roye, and Montdider, then in other provinces, and finally in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, under the direction of the <em>avocat</em>, Pierre Henequin, and the Labruy&egrave;res, father and son. Henry III, fearing to become a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forces, immediately signed with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> the Peace of Beaulieu, by which he granted them important concessions, but at the States-General (November-December, 1576, the influence of the League was preponderant. By the edict of 1 Jan, 1577, the Court annulled the Peace of Beaulieu, and Henry III even joined the League. This was the signal for two new religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, during which the military talents and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Henri de Guise naturally contrasted with the cowardice and wavering policy of the king. The former stood out more and more distinctly as the leader of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, while <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, the future Henry IV, now posed as the champion of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>In the meantime occurred the death of Francis of Valois (10 June, 1584), brother of Henry III and heir presumptive to the throne. It was at once obvious that the Valois dynasty would become extinct with Henry III, and that <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, leader of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, would be the natural heir to the throne. Henri de Guise and the League determined at once to provide against the possibility of such an event. On the one hand, pamphleteers and genealogists, with an eye to the future, wrote countless brochures to prove that the Guises were the real descendants of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and that, like Pepin the Short, they might, with the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> ascend the throne of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On the other hand Henri de Guise concluded the Treaty of Joinville (31 Dec., 1584) with <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, and had it ratified by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. This stipulated that, at the death of Henry III, the Cardinal de Bourbon, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1520-90), the third son of Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vend&ocirc;me, should be recognized as heir to the crown, "to the exclusion of all French princes of the blood at present <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and relapsed". The Cardinal de Bourbon published a manifesto to this effect (1 April, 1585). <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> granted the League a subsidy of 50,000 crowns a month; moreover the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and lower middle classes of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> organized for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> defence, although the municipality was hostile to the League.

<p>Civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> now broke out, and by the treaty of Namours Henry III took sides with the League and revoke all edicts which granted liberty to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (18 July, 1585). When <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> was assured that Henry III and Henri de Guise had come to an agreement, he launched a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the future Henry IV. So long as he was solicited to uphold the Guises against Henry III, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had temporized, but now that the League was operating under royal authority, he interfered in favour of the movement. The Guises in the meantime roused all Champagne and Picardy, and took Toul and <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>. Their lieutenant, Anne de Joyeuse, was defeated at Coutras by <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, but the victories of Henri de Guise at Vimory (26 Oct., 1587) compelled the withdrawal of the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> troops. A secret committee organized the League at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In the provinces it was supported by the nobility, but in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> it drew its strength from the common people and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The secret committee, at first five members, then sixteen, divided <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> into quarters, and in each quarter made preparation for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Soon 30,000 Parisians declared themselves ready to serve Guise, while in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> the preachers of the League upheld in impassioned language the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the people and of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Furthermore, by agreement with Philip II, Guise sent the Duc d'Aumale to overthrow the strongholds of Picardy, in order to assure by this means a way of retreat to the Invincible Armada, which was being sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to avenge <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, niece of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise, executed at the command of Elizabeth (8 Feb., 1587).

<p>Henry III now took fright and ordered Henri de Guise to remain in his government of Champagne; he entered <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, nevertheless, in defiance of the king (9 May, 1588), and was welcomed with enthusiasm by the masses. Repairing to the Louvre, accompanied by 400 gentlemen, he called on Henry III to establish the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The king protested and sought to bring troops to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on whom he might rely. A riot then broke out, and the people were about to march on the Louvre (Day of the Barricades, 12 May, 1588), but Guise, on horseback and unarmed, rode about <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> calming them. He felt assured that the king, who had made him fine promises, was thenceforth in his hands. The former, however, to escape Guise's tutelage, withdrew on the morrow to Chartres.

<p>Guise was now absolute master of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and for some days was all-powerful. The brilliancy of his victory, however, encouraged the extremist of the League. The Sixteen, now in possession of the municipalities, committed many excesses, while such preachers as Boucher, Guincestre, and Pighenat, cried loudly for civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Feeling that he was overruled, Guise now offered to treat with the king, and the latter signed the Edict of Union at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (10 July, 1588), by which he ratified the League, gave Guise various offices of trust, and made him lieutenant-general of the kingdom in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, barred <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> from succession to the throne, and promised the immediate convocation of the States-general. In this way Henry III gained time.

<p>The States-General assembled at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> (Sept.-Dec. 1588), the members of the League being in control. Speeches were made, some aristocratic in sentiment, others democratic, but all against royal absolutism; and Guise was thenceforth the leader, not only of a religious, but also of a political movement. The members of the assembly treated Henry II as a sluggard king; the r&ocirc;le of Guise resembled that of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> forebears under the last Merovingians.

<p>At this junction, Henry III determined to rid himself of Guise, and his death was decided upon. Upon taking his seat at table (22 Dec., 1588) Guise found beneath his napkin a note which warned him that a plot was on foot against him. Below the warning he wrote, "None would dare", and threw it away. The next morning he was summoned to Henry III, and was slain by the guards. A carpet was thrown over his body, and the courtiers made sarcastic speeches as they passed, calling him the "handsome king of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>". Henry III left his apartments to kick the dead man in the face. That same night, Louis, Cardinal of Guise (1555-88), brother of Henri, was assassinated by four archers of the king, who feared less the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> should become a peril to the State. The bodies of the two leaders of the League were burned and thrown into the Loire. This double assassination was at once the subject of a multitude of pamphlets.

<p>By Catherine de Cl&egrave;ves, Henri de Guise had seven daughters and seven sons, on one of whom, Fran&ccedil;ois-Alexandre (1589-1614), a posthumous son, the enthusiastic Parisians bestowed a third name, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>Duke of Mayenne, b. 26 March, 1554; d. at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, 3 Oct. 1611; son of Fran&ccedil;ois de Guise and brother of Henri de Guise. He first bore arms in 1569 besides Henri de Guise at the defence of Portiers against Coligny, then at the battle of Moncontour and at the siege of Brouage. After the close of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to engage in the campaign against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> lord, and embarked with a fleet to assist the expedition of Don Juan of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. He did not return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> until after the massacre of St. Bartholomew. He took part in the fourth <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and accompanied the Duke of Anjou to the siege of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> (1573). Later he followed the duke to his domain in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and when the death of Charles IX made the duke King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under the name Henry III, Mayenne escorted him thither. He took part in the sixth and seventh <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, capturing Poitou (1577) and Dauphiny (1580). His policy was that of his brother, Henri: alliances with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> against <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, ultimately against Henry III, to bring about the succession to the throne of the Cardinal de Bourbon and ultimately the Guises. Henry III, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, had allied himself with the League by the Treat of Nemours, but Mayenne soon realized the uncertainty of the royal attitude. The Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Matignon, who governed Guyenne for the king, hindered more than he favoured Mayenne's campaign against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the south. When the assassination of Henri de Guise revealed the extent of royal duplicity, Mayenne was at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Warned by Bernardo de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador, he had time to gain a place of safety before the arrival of Colonel d'Ornano, whom <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> had sent to arrest him. He retired to his government of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, roused that province and also Champagne, of which his dead brother had been governor, marched on <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and began his active share in the history of the League.

<p>Henry III, who had caused the assassination of Henri de Guise, was denounced by the preachers as a traitor, a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. The Sorbonne and the Parlement proclaimed his disposition. Together with the aldermen and the city councillors, representatives of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> middle classes, Mayenne organized the General Council of Union (<em>Conseil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'union</em>). This council undertook measures in behalf of the whole kingdom, decreased taxes by one-fourth, prepared to defend <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> against <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, called for material assistance from Philip II and for moral aid from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and entered into communion with most of the large cities of the kingdom.

<p>Civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> now raged in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and many cities took the side of the League and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> and the indecision of Henry III. After vainly endeavouring to enter into negotiations with Mayenne, who naturally distrusted the assassin of his brother, Henry III joined forces with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> troops of <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> (1 May, 1589). For some time Mayenne waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the allied forces, but after the defeat of the Duc D'Aumale at Senlis (17 May), he felt that <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was threatened and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fall back for its defence. The united Royalist and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> forces received assistance from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, while the troops of Mayenne and the League, shut up in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1 June), were cut off from all reinforcements, weakened by desertions, and reduced to 8000 men, when Henry III and <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, with a force of 42,000 began an active siege of the capital (28 July). A sort of terror now seized upon the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> populace. Suspicion fell on all; domiciliary visits and proscriptions were the order of the day. Finally the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Jacques Cl&eacute;ment, assassinated Henry III, whereupon <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, abandoned by some of his troops, raised the siege.

<p>The throne was now vacant, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who formed the majority of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> being unwilling to recognize the protestant <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>. Had Mayenne dared to seize the throne and proclaim himself king, his boldness might have succeeded. With Henri de Guise, however, he had five years previously designated the aged Cardinal de Bourbon as heir presumptive, and while the latter lived it was difficult for Mayenne to pretend to the throne. But the sick and aged <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>; the members of the League were therefore unable to place their candidate securely upon the throne, since he was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> pretender. Mayenne assumed the title of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom, took the offensive, and set out for Normandy. At Arques, near Dieppe, he vainly offered battle to <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, and after eleven days of skirmishing (September, 1589), withdrew to Amiens. Learning suddenly that <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> had <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> on <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and had taken by surprise the suburbs of the left bank of the Siene, he hastened to the capital to compel the retreat of Navarre.

<p>A certain number of moderate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, known as <em>les Politiques</em>, were in favour of the latter, and he agreed with them that within six months he would submit the religious question to a council, and until that event would offer no hindrance to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. Among the <em>Politiques</em> were some who already cherished the hope that <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> would become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. One of them, Faudoas de Belin, urged Mayenne to join the <em>Politiques</em> and to entreat Henry IV to become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. While the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Leaguers in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> caused Mayenne to reflect, he nonetheless did not accept Belin's proposal, and in the spring of 1590, being reinforced from <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and Lorraine, he attacked Henry IV on the plain of Ivry (14 March 1590). Being defeated, he was compelled to return to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he announced to the inhabitants that he was going to seek reinforcements in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and called upon them to defend themselves energetically. The death of Cardinal de Bourbon (8 May, 1590) left the members of the League uncertain on an important point, namely, who was the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> heir to the throne.

<p>Then began, in Mayenne's absence, the famous siege of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by Henry IV. Each day the Spanish ambassador, Bernardo de Mendoza, distributed 120 crowns' worth of bread, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> gave his plate to pay the troops, and even the ornaments of the churches were sold. The people satisfied their hunger at the street corners, where they ate from great cauldrons, in which a mixture of oats and bran was boiling, and spent the days in the churches, where twice a day the preachers encouraged them. They assured the people that Mayenne and Alessandro Farnesse, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, would come to their relief. Mayenne, however, tarried, and the famine continued. <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> permitted the beggars, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and students to leave the city, but the provisions still grew less. Men ate the skin of animals, ground and boiled their bones, disinterred the bodies in the cemetery of the Innocents and made food of them.

<p>Mayenne, meanwhile, was negotiating with Alessandro Farnese, governor of the Spanish Low Countries, for reinforcements. He succeeded in sending some troops to the relief of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (17 June), and the arrival of Farnese (23 Aug.), who joined Mayenne at Meaux, made it possible to revictual the city. <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> was compelled to retire, and Mayenne re-entered <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (18 Sept.). The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> dragged on, but the capture by Mayenne of Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry in 1591 could not offset the damage done by the occupation by <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, regarded as the granary of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>The League now suffered from divided counsels. The young son of Duke Henri de Guise had just left his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and the more enthusiastic members of the League planned his marriage to a Spanish princess, after which they would make him king. Mayenne was considered too lukewarm, and when <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>, elected 5 Dec., 1590, and more resolutely devoted to the League than <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, had renewed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, and hurled <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against his adherents (March-June, 1591), the faction of the Sixteen, a body drawn from the councils (nine members each) which directed the various quarters of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and about which were gathered more than 30,000 adherents, desired the establishment of radical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> according to which every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, whether prince, lord, or citizen, should be burned alive, also that the new king should make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on all foreign <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> princes. If the young Duke of Guise could not or would not become king, the Sixteen were quite willing, under certain conditions, to accept Philip II as King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. To assert their power and intentions, they forthwith hung several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the moderate party; Brisson, first President of the Parlement, and the two councillors Larcher and Tardif (15 Nov., 1591).

<p>This news reached Mayenne at Laon, and he returned precipitously to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (28 Nov.); he caused four of the Sixteen to be strangled (4 Dec.) and ranged himself decisively on the side of the moderate party. Negotiation with the victor was henceforth a matter of time. President Jeannin transmitted Mayenne's conditions to <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> (8 May, 1592). These were that the latter should <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, that all the places in possession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should remain for six years under the protection of the League, that Mayenne should become hereditary Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Lyonnais, and grand constable or lieutenant-general of the realm, and that all the members of the League should retain their posts. Henry IV rejected these conditions, and many members of the League were also dissatisfied with them. Mayenne then convoked the States-General (26 Jan., 1593) and announced that they were confronted by the task of electing a king. He adjourned the body until 2 April. Mayenne desired neither a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> king nor a Spanish queen, hence his delays. But he was in the midst of the Parisians who were for the most part inclined to have as Queen of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the Spanish Infanta, daughter of Philip II, on the condition she should wed the young Duke of Guise. Mayenne could not openly oppose the project, but he shrewdly caused the Parlement to issue a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> forbidding the transfer of the crown to foreign princesses or princes (28 June, 1593), the result of which was the abandonment of the Spanish match.

<p>Henry IV made his <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> 25 July, 1593, and on 31 July signed a truce with Mayenne. While the satire "M&eacute;nipp&eacute;e", professing to speak for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, held up to public ridicule the favour exhibited towards <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by certain members of the League, another pamphlet, the "Dialogue du Maheustre et du manat", issued by the Leaguers of the extreme left, cast aspersions on the ability of Mayenne and all but accused him of treason. On 3 January 1594, the Parlement rallied to Henry IV and expressed the desire that Mayenne should treat definitely with him. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, moreover, had ceased to be in sympathy with the League, and was preparing to welcome Henry IV (22 March, 1594). Mayenne kept up the struggle for two years longer, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, who, nevertheless, distrusted him since he had prevented their Infanta from becoming Queen of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Finally, Mayenne retired, discouraged, to his government of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and by a definite treaty with Henry IV (January, 1596), declared the League dissolved, retained three places of safety, <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, Chalon-sur-S&acirc;one, and Seurre, obtained that the princes of the League should be declared innocent of the assassination of Henry III, and that the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> which he had contracted for his party should be paid by Henry IV to the sum of 350,000 crowns. He resigned his government of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; but his son, Henri de Lorraine, became governor of the Ile de France (exclusive of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>) and grand chamberlain. Until his death Mayenne remained a faithful subject of Henry IV and the regent, Marie de' Medici. By his wife, Henriette de Savoie, he had two sons and two daughters.

<h2 id="ix">Charles de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Fourth Duke of Guise, b. 20 Aug., 1571; d. at Cune (Siena), 30 September, 1640; the eldest son of Henri de Guise. He was arrested at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> on the day of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> assassination, and was held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> until 1591. His liberation weakened more than its strengthened the League, for while the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the forty members of the League who formed the Council of Union at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> wished to place Mayenne, the brother of Henri de Guise, on the throne, the faction of the Sixteen and the populace, on the contrary, claimed as king this young Duke of Guise, thus giving rise to dissensions in the League. The chances of the young duke were increased by the possibility of his marriage to the daughter of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Mayenne being already married. But at the States-General of 1593, convoked by Mayenne after the death of the Cardinal de Bourbon, Mayenne diverted the discussion, postponed a decision, and had himself simply confirmed in his position as lieutenant-general of the realm. The Duke of Guise soon ceased to belong to the League. In 1594 he declared himself a subject of Henry IV, and slew with his own hand an old member of the League, the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Saint-Pol, who reproached him with betraying the memory of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Henry IV completed the conquest of the young duke by the confidence which he placed in him. Despite the longstanding pretensions of the Guises to Provence, the king sent him thither to capture <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> from the Duc d'Epernon, who occupied the city in the name of the League. Thus, after 1595, the Duke of Guise, who two years before was on the point of being made king by the League, was in arms against it. Thus ended the political and religious policy of the Guises. Charles de Lorraine married (1611) Henriette-Catherine de Joyeuse, by whom he had ten children. He served under Louis XIII against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and, having taken the side of the queen-mother, Marie de' Medici, against <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, retired to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1631, where he died in obscurity.

<h2 id="x">Henri de Lorraine</h2>

<p>Fifth Duke of Guise, son of Charles de Lorraine, b. 1614, d. 1664. He distinguished himself in 1647 and 1654 during the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> Masaniello against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by the two ineffectual attempts which he made, with the consent of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to wrest from the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> for his own benefit the throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, to which he revived his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family's</a> former pretension. He died without issue.
