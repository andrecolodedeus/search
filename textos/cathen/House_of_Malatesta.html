<h1>House of Malatesta</h1>  

<p>The name of an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> prominent in the history of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, famous alike in the poetry of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and in the annals of the early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. The founder of their power was Malatesta da Verrucchio (died 1312), the leader of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> in Romagna, who in 1295 made himself master of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> by the slaughter of the chief members of the rival <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the Parcitati. Thenceforth the Malatesti ruled over a number of cities in Romagna and the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, including Rimmi until 1500, <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> until 1446, <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, <a href="../cathen/06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a>, and Cervia, sometimes with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> investitures, sometimes merely by the sword. While many of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for their crimes and cruelty, two were men of remarkable virtue: Carlo (died 1429), a staunch supporter of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who represented <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and Galeotto Roberto (died 1432), who became a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and shortened his life by his austerities.
<h2>Giovanni Malatesta</h2>

<p>Giovanni (died 1304), known, from his lameness, as Gianciotto, or Giovanni, lo Sciancato, was the eldest son of Malatesta da Verrucchio. From 1275 onwards he played an active part in the Romagnole <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and factions. He is chiefly famous for the domestic tragedy of 1285, recorded in the "Inferno" of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, when, having detected his wife, Francesca da Polenta, in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with his brother Paolo, he killed them both with his own hands. He captured <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> in 1294, and ruled it as podest&agrave; until his death.
<h2>Sigismondo Malatesta</h2>

<p>Sigismondo (born 1417; died 1468) was a son of Pandolfo di Galeotto Malatesta, the descendant of a half-brother of Gianciotto. On the abdication of his half-brother, Galeotto Roberto, in 1432, he succeeded to the lordship of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, and Cesena, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar. From his childhood he was a skilful and daring soldier, and throughout his life was regarded as almost the first captain in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. An appalling picture of his character is given by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> in his "Commentaries", He was undoubtedly one of the worst tyrants of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, without fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or man. At the same time, he shared to a high degree in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> cult of art and letters, and many <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> and poets found shelter at his court. The wonderful temple of San Francesco at <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> of all professedly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches, was built for him by Leon Battista Alberti; Piero de' Franceschi <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> him as kneeling before St. Sigismund, and Pisanello cast his portrait in a splendid medal which is a masterpiece of its kind. Sigismondo is accused of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his two wives, Ginevra, d'Este and Polissena Sforza. He afterwards married his mistress, the famous Isotta degli Atti, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he composed poems which are still extant. In 1465 he commanded the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> army in the unsuccessful campaign undertaken against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the Morea, and on this occasion he discovered the remains of <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Gemisthus Pletho</a> (the Byzantine scholar who introduced <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), which he brought back with him to <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and solemnly enshrined in San Francesco. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, who held him in peculiar abhorrence, partly because of his treachery towards <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, had begun by degrees to deprive him of his dominions, and <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> continued the same course until only <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> itself remained. Infuriated at a demand to surrender <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> also, Sigismondo went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1468, with the intention of slaying the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with his own hands. Either opportunity or resolution failed him. <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul</a> seems to have pardoned him and even confirmed him in the possession of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, but Sigismondo returned home a broken man, and died a few months later.
<h2>Roberto Malatesta</h2>

<p>Roberto (died 1482), an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Sigismondo, possessed himself of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> by treachery on his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death. He <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> his two half-brothers, the sons of Sigismondo by Isotta, and is said to have poisoned Isotta herself. In 1475 he was invested with the vicariate of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. Roberto inherited his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> military talent, and recovered some of the territory that he had lost. His great achievement was the liberation of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the victory of Campo Morto, 21 August, 1482, when, at the head of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> forces, he completely defeated the royal army of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> under the command of Duke Alfonso of Calabria. He died of fever, while pursuing the campaign, in the following month. His son, Pandolfo, a cruel and contemptible tyrant, was expelled from <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> by Cesare Borgia in 1500, and, after several brief restorations of the Malatesti, the city was finally incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> in 1528.
