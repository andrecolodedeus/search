<h1>Hubert and Jan van Eyck</h1>  

<p>Brothers, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> illuminators and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, founders of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> and consequently of all the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the North of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Hubert was born at Maeseyck (i.e. Eyck on the Meuse) in the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Diocese of Li&egrave;ge</a>, about 1366, and his brother Jan about twenty years later, 1385. They had a sister named Margaret who won fame as a miniaturist.

<p>A document of 1413 makes the earliest mention we have of a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by "Master Hubert". In 1424 he was living at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, and he died there on the 18th of September, 1426. We have no further definite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning the elder of the brothers. Of the younger we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in 1420 he presented a Madonna's head to the Guild of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, that in 1422 he decorated a <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, and that in 1425 he was at <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a> in the service of Jean Sans Merci. Afterwards he went to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> and to Lille to the court of Philip the Good, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, as <em>peintre et varlet de chambre.</em> He was already a man of some influence at court, and he travelled in the embassy charged to ask the hand of Isabella of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> for Philip, and it was his privilege to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> her portrait "true to life", thereby fixing Philip's choice. This journey lasted from the 18th of October, 1428, to the end of December, 1429. In 1431 he went to Hesdin to superintend, for the Duke, the work going on at the castle there: and afterwards he returned to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, which he seldom left again. He married, and a child of his was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 1434. In 1436 we learn once more that he received 720 <em>livres</em> on account of "certain secret matter", doubtless in connection with some new mission or journey. He died towards the end of June, 1441.

<p>The most important work of the brothers <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Eyck</a>, and the one that places their names among the great masters of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> for ever, is the famous altarpiece, "The Adoration of the Lamb", of which the central Portion is preserved in St-Bavons at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, while the wings have found their way to the Museums of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>.
<em>Note:</em> The Ghent alterpiece, after many trials and tribulations during reformation and two world <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, is on display in the Ghent Cathedral (Saint Bavo). In 1934 the panel depicting the Just Judges was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> and never recovered. It is now substituted with a copy.]

<p>It is one of the enigmas of art. All the questions bearing on it may, however, be reduced to two: Who was its author? and, What was its origin? As to its authorship, all we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> depends on an inscription obscure enough, which is to be read on the edge of its frame: <blockquote>

<p>Pictor Hubertus e Eyck major quo nemo repertus <br>Incepit pondus: quod Johannes arte secundus <br>Suscepit letus, Judoci Vyd prece fretus Vers-V seXta Ma-I: Vos CoLLoCat a-Cta tVerI.</blockquote>

<p>The faulty Latin of this cryptic inscription means: "Hubert van Eyck, the greatest <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> that ever lived, began this work [<em>pondus</em>], which John, his brother, second only to him in skill, had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to continue at the request of Jodocus (Josse) Vydt. By this line, on the 6th of May, you learn when the work was completed, i.e., MCCCCXXXII." That it is their joint work is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, but it is impossible to distinguish which portion belongs to each brother. Very soon Jan began to get all the credit for it. <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer</a> mentions only Jan in his "Journal" of 1521. But the inscription clearly states that Hubert began the work and asserts that he was the greater artist, his brother being called in only at his death, and in order to complete it. But how far had Hubert progressed with it? How far back had he been commissioned to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> it? In 1426 were portions of it finished, or was it merely a sketch, a general outline when Jan took charge? Who suggested the subject? Who planned its treatment? Can we believe that a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> living in a fifteenth century atmosphere could have elaborated by himself from a few texts of the Apocalypse (v, 6-14) such a wealth of detail, such symphony of symbolism and imagery? Who was the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> who inspired this mighty poem as others had inspired the learned allegories of the Chapel of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and of the Hall of the Segnatura? And again, in the history of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> from the miniatures of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Apocalypses (eleventh century) to the Angers tapestries, what were the artistic sources of this great work?

<p>This moral encyclopedia of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, if we may call it such, treats of all things in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth (there was a predella to it depicting <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but it disappeared in the sixteenth century); it portrays <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man in all their historical and mystical relations; it tells us of the heavenly and the earthly <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, of the ages that have followed one another in the flight of time, of the Dogma of the Fall, and that of the Redemption, of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, and of the first <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; of the death of Abel (type of Christ); of the years of expectation of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and just men of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; of the mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; of the Trinity; of the world subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Christ; of the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, her <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, her virgins, her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, her pontiffs, her confessors, her warrior princes; of all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> in a landscape filled with <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> spires (Rome, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, etc.). And can we in reason be asked to believe that this wonderful pictorial epic reaching out from the beginning to the consummation of the world and ending in a glimpse of the eternal life to come as full in conception and as orderly in arrangement as the "Divina Commedia" itself; summing up the Old as well as the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, drawing its inspiration from St. Augustine's "Civitas Dei", and "Vincent of Beauvais' "Speculum Majus", as well as Jacobus de Voragine's "Legenda Aurea", and <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "De Monarchia"; a compendium of politics, history and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and which crowns the representation man's life on earth by a glimpse of the Infinite, can we in reason be asked to believe that this lofty expression of the ideals of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> sprang Minerva-like, fully formed from the brain of a single artist?



<p>No one can adopt this supposition except for the purpose of ascribing all the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having conceived this <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> to the elder of the brothers. As an assumption, however, it is altogether gratuitous. There is not one of the scenes that can be attributed to Hubert with any degree of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>; and no work the brothers <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Eyck</a> have left us (with the exception of the "Fount of Salvation" in the Prado Museum, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and this is the work of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>) shows a similar dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> character, a like power of design and richness of thought that this "Lamb does. Taken as a whole the work of the Van Eycks has a totally different tendency. It is frankly naturalistic in face, as well as in intention. So that when Hubert is labelled a thinker, it is for no other reason than the wish to differentiate him, and to separate him from Jan. How futile this distinction is, is made clear if we look into the results obtained by applying it as a criterion to the work of the two brothers. On not a single disputed <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> has agreement been reached; and every <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> that has been attributed to Hubert by one connoisseur, has been adjudged by others for equally good reasons to Jan.

<p>The catalogue of their work has been reconstructed more than twenty times. The <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> of the Lamb" has been divided in a hundred different ways, and each in turn has been given to first one brother and then to the other over and over again. Each year sees a new theory proposed. After Waagen came James Weale; after Hymans, Dvorak, and after Stoerck, Wurzbach; and we are as far from the solution as ever. The masterpiece keeps its secret, and will probably never give it up. In any case, seeing that the whole <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was retouched at least twice during the sixteenth century, all evidence of individual technic must have been buried beneath these restorations; and in all likelihood the little points and peculiarities attributed to Hubert or to Jan, are really the work of Michael Coxie. But there is a larger and a wider question at issue than such idle wranglings that can never be settled, the question as to the effect and the nature of the artistic revolution to which the brothers <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Eyck</a> have given their name.

<p>What constitutes the <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> of the "Lamb" a unique moment in the history of art and gives it its supreme interest in our eyes, is the fact that it unites in itself the styles and the genius of two opposing epochs. Whereas its general plan belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, its execution, its manner of seeing things and putting them on canvas, are truly modern. The masterpiece has a double nature, so to speak. The genius of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> for what was concrete and realistic is wedded to the majesty of the Gothic and its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the abstract. It shows us the wondrous blending of two principles that would seem necessarily to exclude each other, like the past and the future, and that we never meet with again save in opposition. It is this that constitutes the supreme interest of the work, that it contains the noblest expression of the old mystical genius together with the most powerful example of modern <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>. In the sincerity, breadth, and <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>, no one at any time nor of any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has excelled the Van Eycks. Nature, which, prior to their day, men had looked at as through a veil of formulae and symbols, they seem suddenly to have unveiled. They invented, so to speak, the world of realities. The happenings of all sorts in the world of nature, the <em>sylva rerum</em>, with which they have endowed the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, are always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to life. Landscapes, atmospheres, types, physiognomies, a wealth of studies and sketches of all sorts, rich materials, cloths, cimars (robes), copes, brilliancy of precious stones and works of the goldsmith's art; all are copied to perfection, and the deftness of the work is beyond compare. The masterpiece inaugurates a new era in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. If the object of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> art is to depict the visible world, if his aim ought to be not so much the expression of a thought as to hold up the mirror to life, then for the first time in its history <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> entered into its birthright in this <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a>, and gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its legitimacy in this first attempt. Life under all its sensible forms and aspects sweeps through this mighty scene like a motif, life with all its myriad changes and variety of moods, brushing aside the dry as dust ideograms and crumbling hieroglyphics of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>The absolute is abandoned, and the relative brought into fashion. The eye is turned away from the vision of the ideal, but the feet are more firmly planted on the real. The word <em>nature</em> undergoes a change of meaning. Once it had been a vague <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, a something like the nominals and <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, which are understood by the intelligence rather than perceived by the senses. In that lofty plane of thought in which art in the thirteenth century <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to move, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> existed really in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Henceforth, however, nature changed her aspect for the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>; he refrains from expressing any opinions as to the essence of things, but delights in all their accidental qualities. The actual, the fact, whether it be positive, complex, capricious, or odd, becomes of more importance than the abstract and immutable law. The absolute cause of all things is neglected in favour of the rich and glowing vegetation of nature; principles have less value than their consequences, less importance is given to types than <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The vast harvest of phenomena from the ever teeming field of reality and experience is henceforth open to art. A <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> becomes what the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> has actually seen; what he has found in nature; the story of his feelings in the midst of things. In this a new kind of <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a> replaces the old. And art, thus freed from the academism of the Gothic tradition, was not to slavishly copy nature, but to serve as a vehicle for the expression of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, and to act as the safest confidante of his emotional experiences.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> marks the triumph of this basic artistic revolution from which all modern art has sprung. Never was a richer shrine of nature and of life got together by a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. In two hundred figures of every size, sex, race, and costume we behold a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. We see before us all the beauty of the physical world, the woods, the fields, the rocks, the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> places, a geography of earth with its climates and its flora, palms, cacti, and aloes (which foolishly has led some to believe that Hubert must have traveled in the East). And the world of art is not forgotten; styles of architecture, towers, <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>, are all brought in. In a word, life out-of-doors and within doors, with all its social activities and moral colouring, is portrayed. There are interiors, such as the room of the Blessed Virgin, a young <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> maiden, with its <em>prie-Dieu</em>, its nicely tiled floor, its washstand and basin, and its open window looking out on to the pointed roofs of a row of brick houses. There are portraits of a marvellous realism, such as those of the donor and his wife; epic figures, such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> under the guise of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with a triple <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, type of the pontiff-king; and there are figures full of charm and poetry, such as the singing <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (Berlin museum), symbolizing the harmonies of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, under the form of entrancing minstrelsy, or of the chanting of choir boys. Other figures are fearful in their <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>, such as the figures of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a> (Brussels museum) which would suffice alone to immortalize their creator, because of their audacious nudity, their stiff and awkward manner, and their eloquent ugliness.

<p>Such a transformation, of course, exceeds the powers of any one man, or even of two brothers. And like all great works, the <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> is but the result of the labours of more than one generation. It was not a local movement; its influences were at work up and down throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the work of <a href="../cathen/12601a.htm">Jacopo della Quercia</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>, the frescoes of <a href="../cathen/09769a.htm">Masolino</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a> (1428) are contemporary with the labours of the Van Eycks: and bear traces of similar tendencies. But the birthplace of the movement was not on Italian soil. It is in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> we find the earliest evidence of it, about the of the fourteenth century. A few <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, like the Visitation group in the great doorway at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1310), the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of St. Denis, the portraits of King Charles V and his wife Eleanor (in the Louvre), mark the last stages in the victorious progress. The same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which a century earlier had developed the Gothic ideal, was about to produce by a natural evolution the new principles and the new methods. An important factor in this evolution was the creation of the Duchies of Berry and of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and the alliance of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> by marriage (1384). At the Court of the Valois, the most brilliant in the world, famous for its voluptuousness, its elegance, and its worship of all the arts of life, and under the patronage of its princes, no less famous for their dissolute lives than for their artistic taste and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of luxury, there rapidly grew up a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, goldsmiths, and miniaturists, cosmopolitans by birth, but <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, who were the nucleus of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>.

<p>The larger part of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, frescoes, and <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> of this epoch have perished; but the miniatures supply all the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> we need. Especially in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> made at the time for the Duc de Berry do we find the links of this glorious history. Many of the books collected by this incomparable Maecenas have come down to us; some of them illustrated by Andr&eacute; Beauneveu, Jacquemart of Hesdin, or Jacques Cohn of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. But the most important of all is the seignorial <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> &#151; one of the treasures of Chantilly &#151; known as the "Book of Hours of the Duc de Berry . This wonderful book was adorned from 1413 to 1416 by three artists; "the three illuminator-brothers" spoken of by Guillebert of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, the brothers <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">de Limbourg</a> or simply the Limbourgs. Nearly all the poetic fancy of the Van Eycks is already outlined in this Book of Hours, especially on their landscape side; And whereas the <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">Limbourgs</a> kept to the country around <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, the Van Eycks followed the same route, and doubtless experienced the same influences. But there is something more. Another <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, "The Hours of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, which was unfortunately destroyed in the fire at the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of that town, 20 January, 1904, belonged successively to the Duc de Berry (d. 1416) and to Duke William IV of Bavaria-Hainault. And it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Hubert van Eyck spent some time in the latter's service. Paul Durrieu has given very weighty reasons for attributing the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to him, and for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that he began it for the Duc de Berry. Thus the art of the Van Eycks would be but the culminating point of the great <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> movement inaugurated at the Court of the Valois in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and which reached its apogee in 1400. Perhaps this was what the Italian Bishop Facius meant to imply when in 1456 he spoke of Jan van Eyck as Johannes Gallicus.

<p>This is a partial solution of the enigma of the altarpiece. Hubert and Jan van Eyck are but continuators, masters indeed, of an art that began before them and without them. But what was it they added that caused the new style in art to date only from their work? If we are to credit <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, Van Mander, and all the historical writers, their great discovery was the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> with oils. Painting with oil had been discovered long before; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Theophilus gives a recipe for it in the eleventh century. And as we have seen, the new aestheticism had been already formulated in the miniatures of the <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">Limbourgs</a> and of the Van Eycks themselves. Whatever importance in art its material and mechanical methods may have, it would be too humiliating to make it depend entirely on the particular fluid, water, gum, or albumen used in mixing the colours. Moreover, on canvases 500 years old from which all moisture has long since dried up he would be a daring critic who would venture to assert the proportion of oil or distemper used by the artist. To build one's criticism on such a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> principle is like seeking the scent of the "Roses of Sadi." The real merit of the Van Eycks is elsewhere. By a chain of circumstances (The Battle of Agincourt, the madness of Charles VI, and the minority of Charles VII), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was brought to the edge of ruin, and suddenly lost control of the movement that it had begun.

<p>Comfort, art, luxury began to cluster around the new fortunes of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, as the home of wealth in the North. Ghent, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, Antwerp became the centres of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In these new towns of little culture and traditional refinement, and lacking in reserve (Taine, "Philosophie de l'Art aux Pays-Bas" - description of the festivals known as the <em>Voeu du faisan</em>), <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>, freed from the restraints French taste would have imposed on it, was enabled to grow at its ease and spread without restriction. The Germanic element which had already shown itself in such men as Beauneveu, Malouel, the <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">Limbourgs</a>, burst out, and carried everything before it in the work of the Van Eycks. For the first time the genius of the North shook off all those cosmopolitan influences which had hitherto refined it, and gave itself free scope.

<p>It paused not to think of what had gone before, and it was not concerned with such things as taste, nobility, or beauty. Such preoccupations as these, as the antique began to have an influence, became more and more the distinguishing characteristics and limitation of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>. It is enough to compare the ugly yet touching figures of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> by Jan van Eyck with those by <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a> in the Brancacci Chapel to be convinced of this. On the one side there is realism, but the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> has scruples, reserves, a sense of modesty: on the other there is absolute crudity, what we might call <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> pure and simple. What does this mean, but that <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, which had hitherto been a universal, international art, is beginning to localize itself; and that what had hitherto been a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a>, or better still, Western, colour-language is about to split up into many dialects and national modes of speech? It is the real glory of the Van Eycks, that they emancipated the genius of the races of the North and gave it its first full expression. During a whole century (1430-1530) the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> they founded at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> was always producing new works and renewing its own strength. During a century, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> - Petrus Cristus, G&eacute;rard de St-Jean, Ouwater, Hugo van der Goes, <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Roger van der Weyden</a>, Memlinck, G&eacute;rard David, Martin Sch&ouml;ngauer, Lucas of Leyden &#151; never ceased their more or less directly from their work. In 1445 the Catalonian Luis Dalmau made a copy of the <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06161b.htm">Jean Fouquet</a>, Nicolas Froment, on the banks of the Loire and of the Rhone, were disciples of Jan van Eyck. Even <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> did not escape their sovereign influence. As early as the middle of the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Jan van Eyck were being treasured at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and at <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>.

<p>Antonello of <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a> went to study art in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. <a href="../cathen/06545a.htm">Ghirlandajo</a> imitated the famous Portinari altarpiece by H. van der Goes, and whenever an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> relaxed a moment his straining after art to snatch a breath of gayety or a lesson in realism, it was always to the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he turned; always, until the triumph of the antique was assured, and <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, by the constraining revelation of its beauty, restored for a time the reign of the ideal. Their triumph was, however, short-lived; the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and aristocratic ideal of art and life, with all its loftiness and rigidity, begin to give way from the beginning of the seventeenth century, with its new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> and Amsterdam, before the <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> of the North, before the more homely, hearty, and winning genius of the Van Eycks. It is therefore impossible to exaggerate the importance of their work, which, besides occupying a unique position throughout the fifteenth century, led the way in the evolution which two centuries later produced such <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> as <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> and Rembrandt.
