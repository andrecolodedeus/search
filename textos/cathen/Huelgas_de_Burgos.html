<h1>Huelgas de Burgos</h1>  

<p>The royal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Las Huelgas de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> was founded by Alfonso VIII at the instance of his consort, Do&ntilde;a Leonor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, about the year 1180, and, upon the completion of the work <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their installation the first <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were brought to it, conformably with the wishes of its founders from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tulebras in <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>. Do&ntilde;a Misol, or Mar&iacute;a Sol, was its first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, and to her was addressed the charter of foundation, in which Alfonso VIII granted to the community the lordship of sundry villages and territories, entire exemption from taxes, numberless <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> and franchises, and the enjoyment of its possessions under the king's own privilege. These grants were augmented until at the end of the fourteenth century, no <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord in Castile, except the king, had a larger number of vassals. In 1199 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> and became the burial-place of the royal family; the general chapter of the order made this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the mother-house of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> established in Castile and Leon and the annual meeting-place of the abbesses for the holding of their chapter. In 1212, two months before the battle of Las Navas, Alfonso VIII made the King's Hospital, with all its dependencies, subject to the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Las Huelgas. Immediately after its foundation, ladies of the noblest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> began to take the habit at Las Huelgas, following the example of the Infanta Do&ntilde;a Costanza, daughter of the founder, and another Do&ntilde; Costanza, sister of St. Ferdinand, his daughter Do&ntilde;a Berenguela, Do&ntilde;a Blanca of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. and others. The most auspicious events took place here, and such, for example, as the knightly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of St. Ferdinand and his successors, the nuptials of Leonor (Eleanor of Castile) with Prince Edward, heir to the throne of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and of the Infante Don Fernando de la Cerda with Blanche, second daughter of St. Louis, the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronations</a> of Alfonso XI, Henry II, and John I, and the proclamation of the coming of age of Henry III. Here, too, were buried Alfonso VII, Sancho III, and many infantes and infantas, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was often visited by, and received gifts from, the kings and queens.

<p>The characteristic peculiarity, however, which made this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> famous was its <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess's</a> exercise, for some centuries, of the <em>vere nullius</em> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, until, in 1873, all exempt jurisdictions were abolished by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quae diversa". The abbesses of Huelgas, in consequence of this privilege, issued faculties to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, and to preach; they nominated <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, granted letters dimissory, took cognizance of the first instance in all causes, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, criminal, and relating to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, imposed centuries through their ecclesiastical judges, confirmed the abbesses of their subject houses, drew up constitutions, visited <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> &#151; in a word, they possessed a full <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. Don Amancio Rodr&iacute;guez, who has made a special study of Huelgas, assures us that there never was any pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in which these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were specifically granted; but there certainly was the tacit consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, without which the practical exercise of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> would never have been possible under the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>. Besides, not only the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> confirmed the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess'</a> decisions on appeal and rejected appeals unduly made, in order that the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> might deal with the cases as in the first instance. The origin of this privilege, then, must be sought in the king's intervention in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the protection accorded by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>, and in the fact that several infantas were <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The royal foundation fell somewhat into decay in the time of Charles I, but afterwards recovered some of its ancient splendour, chiefly in the beginning of the seventeenth century, when Do&ntilde;a Ana de <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, natural daughter of Don John of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, brother of Philip II, became its <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> in perpetuity. From the time of the secularization of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> (<em>Leyes de Desamortizaci&oacute;n</em>) its support and conservation has been the care of the sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.
