<h1>Hugh Capet</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, founder of the Capetian dynasty, b. about the middle of the tenth century; d. about 996, probably 24 October. He was the second son of Hugh the Great, Count of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and Hedwig, sister of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, German Emperor, and was about ten years old when he inherited from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> the Countship of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. About 970 he married Adelaide of Aquitaine, and as early as 985 the famous Gerbert wrote "The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Lothair governs <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> only in name. The king of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is Hugh." When Louis V died, 21 May, 987, the assistance of Adalberon, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and of Gerbert, brought about the election of Hugh. The electoral assembly of Senlis listened to a discourse of Adalberon: "Crown the Duke", he said. "He is most illustrious by his exploits, his nobility, his forces. The throne is not acquired by hereditary right; no one should be raised to it unless distinguished not only for nobility of birth, but for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". A unanimous vote ratified this discourse, and Hugh Capet was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at Noyon, 3 July, 987. Thus his accession, as M. Luchaire says, was above all "an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> achievement". Hugh possessed towns and estates in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Orl&eacute;ans, and in the district of Senlis and Chartres, Touraine and Anjou, but on the whole these were restricted domains, as his vassals on the borders of the Seine and the Loire contested his authority. His military power was mediocre, and he had frequently to seek military aid in alliance with Normandy. But he possessed moral power and a political influence which reached the most remote parts of the kingdom and was felt even by foreigners. His chief concern was to maintain over the <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Archdiocese of Reims</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> comprised nearly the whole of northern and northeastern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a continuous, immediate, and uncontested authority. The <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Archdiocese of Reims</a> possessed a double importance, first because the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect and crown the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and next because of its geographical situation between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The death of Adalberon, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by M. Lot to have taken place 23 January, 989, disturbed the new king, and Arnoul, the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> whom he accepted at the end of March, 989, as successor to Adalberon, attempted a restoration of the Carlovingians (Sept., 989), and Charles of Lorraine, their heir, was for a short time master of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and Laon. Arnoul refused to appear at the Council of Senlis (beginning of 990), but the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of Charles of Lorraine and of Arnoul (29 March, 991), and the deposition of Arnoul pronounced at the Council of St. Basle, fixed by M. Lot at 17 and 18 June, 991 (and not 993), assured the maintenance of the Capetian dynasty. Gerbert became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a> (21 June, 991).

<p>This revolution accomplished by a council was received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> with reserve. When Hugh Capet requested the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to legitimize the action of the council, <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XVI</a> was silent; later, under the influence of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused formally to recognize the election of Gerbert. Then began the difficulties which led the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> devoted to Hugh to profess certain "Gallican principles". Nevertheless, Hugh must not be represented as wishing to found a State Church; what he wished was to maintain the <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Archdiocese of Reims</a> under the domination of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and to remove it from the influence of the German emperors. If his attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was often suspicious, it was not due to a Gallican <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, but because he feared that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the time were too subservient to the policy of the emperors; hence his relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were merely an episode in his general policy, destined to bring about the cessation of the powerful influence which the Saxon dynasty had exercised over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the tenth century.

<p>His domestic policy was very favourable to the development of monastic life and the autonomy of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. He defended their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> against lay tyranny; he sought to remove them from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> while upholding the royal right to confirm abbatial elections; he supported all the liberties of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the exercise of their electoral <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; he renounced the custom of distributing <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> as <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Because of its political importance he wished to retain effective direction over the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, and even under the reign of the Plantagenet Henry II the Capetians preserved considerable influence at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and along the Middle Loire. Apropos of Hugh Capet it is worthy of note that because the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had in their possession the famous cope (<em>cappa</em>) of St. Martin, certain authors give to Hugh the Great and to his son Hugh the surname of Capet, which in history is reserved exclusively for the subject of this article. Hugh Capet in his religious policy applied and favoured the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of reform upheld by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny.
