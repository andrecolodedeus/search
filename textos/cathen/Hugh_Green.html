<h1>Hugh Green</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>; born about 1584; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> 19 August, 1642. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, sent him to Peterhouse, <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, where he took his degree in 1605, but was afterwards <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> and entered <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a> in 1610. He left again in 1612 to try his <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a> among the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. From want of health or some other cause, he was unable to continue, and became a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Chideock Castle, Dorsetshire, the home of <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Lady Arundell of Lanherne</a>. On 8 March, 1641, Charles I, to placate the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> Parliament, issued a proclamation banishing all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from England, and Green resolved to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> this order. Unfortunately the news had been late in reaching him, and when he embarked the month of grace given for departure was just over. He was therefore arrested, tried, and condemned to death in August. In prison his constancy so affected his fellow-captives that two or three <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sentenced to die with him sent him word that they would ask his <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> before death. They did so after confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the people, and were absolved by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> reward for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> immediately followed. A <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a>, despite the danger, rode up in disguise on horseback, and at a given sign absolved the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who made a noble confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before death. As the executioner was quite unskilled, he could not find the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> heart, and the butchery with appalling cruelty was prolonged for nearly half an hour. After this the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> played football with his head, a barbarity happily not repeated in the history of the English martyrs.
