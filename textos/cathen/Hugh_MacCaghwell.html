<h1>Hugh MacCaghwell</h1>  

<p>(Cavellus). <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at Saul, Co. Down, 1571; died 22 September, 1626. He received his earliest <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native place and then passed to a famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the Isle of Man. On his return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he was selected by Hugh, Prince of Tyrone, as tutor to his sons Henry and Hugh. He was sent by the prince as special messenger to the Court of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to solicit aid for the Ulster forces. During his stay at Salamanca, where the Court then resided, he frequented the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and took doctor's degrees in divinity. Soon afterwards he gave up all worldly greatness to enter the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> order. He enjoyed a great reputation as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, and his commentaries on <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">John Duns Scotus</a> were held in high repute. Vernul&aelig;us says that he was conspicuous for his virtues and that his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life and profound learning made him the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of his time. It was principally due to his great influence at the Spanish Court that the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> College of St. Anthony was founded at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. After his entry into the order, Hugh taught for some time in the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, then he was appointed superior an lecturer at St. Anthony's, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Among his pupils were <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">John Colgan</a>, Patrick Fleming, <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Hugh Ward</a>, Anthony Hickey, etc. He was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to lecture in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Aracoeli; but his energies were not limited to his work as professor. He was employed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on several commissions. He gave substantial help to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Father Luke Wadding</a> in founding and developing St. Isidore's and the Ludovisi colleges for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> students. On 17 March, 1626, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, passing over all the other candidates, nominated Hugh MacCaghwell <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place on 7 June, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Isidore. Thomas Walsh, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the same time. The consecrating <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was Gabriel, Cardinal de Trejo, a great friend of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. His health had been much weakened by his manifold <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and the great austerities he practised. In making the visitations of the provinces of the order he always travelled on foot, and passed much time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. While making preparation for his departure for his arduous mission he was seized with fever and died. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Isidore, and his friend Don John O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, had a monument placed over his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>. Nicolaus Vernul&aelig;us delivered an oration before the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> commemorating the virtues and learning of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, which was published at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 1657.

<p>MacCaghwell's principal works are: "Scoti Commentaria in quatuor libros Sententiarum", 2 vols., folio, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1620 (to this work is prefixed a life of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>); "Scoti Commentaria seu Reportata Parisiensia"; "Qu&aelig;stiones quodilibetales"; "Qu&aelig;stiones in libros de anima"; "Qu&aelig;stiones in metaphysicam"; etc. He also wrote a work in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, which was printed at the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> press in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Anthony's, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in 1618, entitled "Scathain sacramunthe na Aithrighe", that is, "The Mirror of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>".
