<h1>Hugh O'Reilly</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, head of the Confederates of Kilkenny, b. 1580; d. on Trinity Island in Lough Erne. He first conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of forming this national movement into a regular organization. He convened a provincial synod at <a href="../cathen/08615a.htm">Kells</a> early in March, 1642, in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> declared the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> undertaken by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> people for their king, religion, and country to be just and lawful. The following May (1642) he convened a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a>, consisting of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and civil lords, at Kilkenny. After having ratified their former declaration, they framed an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of association to be taken by all their adherents, binding them to maintain the fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the free exercise of religion, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> allegiance to Charles I. Orders were issued to levy men and raise money; to establish a mint and an official printing press; to take the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> off such foreign imports as wheat and corn, lead, iron, arms and ammunition; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should pay a certain sum for national purposes out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues that had come back into their possession; and agents should be sent to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> courts to solicit aid. They gave letters of credit and chartered some light vessels that were to fly the Confederate colors and protect the coast, and they drafted a remonstrance to the king declaring their loyalty and protesting against the acts of tyranny, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and intolerance of the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> lord justices and Parliament of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in confiscating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lands and putting a ban on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> school-teachers. The assembly lasted until 9 January, agreeing to meet 20 May following. The seal of the Confederation bore in its centre a large cross rising out of a flaming heart, above were the wings of a dove, on the left a harp, and on the right a crown; the legend read: Pro Deo, Rege, et Patria, Hiberni Unanimes.

<p>Wherever the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate's</a> partisans commanded, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and people were safe, and were even protected in the exercise of their own religious worship. Archbishop O'Reilly was, throughout the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and the terrible years that followed it, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and guide of the national party; he did his utmost to restrain the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the people, who would have wreaked vengeance on their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> had they been left to their own <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> at that crisis. He urged Sir Phelim O'Neile and Lord Iveagh to keep the armed multitudes in check and prevent a massacre and pillage of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Such salutary restraint produced the most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> results, for even the rudest of the northern chieftains respected him too much to violate his lessons of forbearance and charity. When the great chieftain, <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe</a>, was dying, he had himself taken to Ballinacorgy Castle, the residence of his brother-in-law Philip O'Reilly, where he was attended by Archbishop O'Reilly. Local tradition gives the ruined Abbey of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, on an island a few miles from Ballinagorgy Castle, as his last resting place. In the same locality Archbishop O'Reilly was buried. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate's</a> signature is still to be seen in most of the manifestoes of the Confederation of Kilkenny as "Hugo Armacanus".
