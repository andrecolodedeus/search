<h1>Hugh Ward</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/08116a.htm">Irish</a>, &AElig;DH BUIDH MAC-AN-BHAIRD).

<p>Hagiographer, born in Donegal, about 1590; died 8 November, 1635. His father, Geoffrey, was Toparch of Lettermacward, and head of the Tirconnell branch of the ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Mac-an-bhaird. From remote time this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> cultivated literature and filled the office of <em>Ollav</em> or chief historian to the O'Donnells. In 1607 he left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>. Here he made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a>, under whose guidance he joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 1616. After taking his degrees and receiving <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he was sent by the general of the order to lecture on philosophy at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and soon after was appointed professor of Divinity at St. Anthony's College, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. On 21 April, 1626, he was elected <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college. <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> states that Ward possessed great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers and a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> language and antiquities; and <a href="../cathen/12227b.htm">John Ponce</a> praises highly his lectures on <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, affirming that in these <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> he was second to none of the great writers of his time. But Ward's chief interest was centred in the history and literature of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The plan of publishing the lives of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and other ancient records of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was his; he was pioneer and founder of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> archaeology that arose in the seventeenth century, with its centre in the College of St. Anthony. At Salamanca he discussed his project with <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a>, who promised him all help from the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he met Father Patrick Fleming, a distinguished <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholar, whom he urged to visit the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in search of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> documents. At the time Ward reached <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, St. Anthony's numbered among its inmates several accomplished <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholars: MacCaghwell, Hickey, <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>, O'Docharty, and shortly afterwards Br. Michael O'Clery.

<p>Ward laid before his associates his plan for a comprehensive history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> &#151; civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> &#151; a "Thesaurus Antiquitatum Hibernicarum", and how the work was to be carried out. The first step was to procure original ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> or to have transcripts made of them. Father Patrick Fleming had already begun work in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> on the Continent, and it was decided to send Br. Michael O'Clery (Belonging to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of hereditary scholars) to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to collect <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In the meantime Ward was employed in arranging and examining the documents which had been transmitted to St. Anthony's. He investigated the sources of the ancient <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> and chronicles. He was in constant correspondence with the early <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> <a href="../cathen/07240a.htm">Henschenius</a>, Rosweydus, Papebroch, etc. on mattes regarding the history and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. John Bap. Sollerius styles him "Vir doctissimus ac hagiographus eximius", and says that Ward's arguments in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> birthplace of St. Rumold are unanswerable. At the time of his death Ward had ready for publication several treatises which he intended as "Prolegomena" to his great work. The late <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, Dr. Reeves, writing on Ward and his fellow-labourers, pays an eloquent tribute to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> for their services to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> archaeology. Ward was buried in the college church. The following are the works he left ready for publication: "De nomenclatura hiberniae"; "De statu et processu veteris in Hibernia reipublicae"; "Martyrologium ex multis vetustis Latino-Hibernicum"; "Anagraphen magnalium S. Patricii"; "Investigatio Ursulanae expeditionis"; "S. Rumoldi Acta". These works were accompanied by critical dissertations and notes on historical and topographical questions. The "Acta S. Rumoldi" was published at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1662, by one of Ward's disciples, Thomas O'Sherin. Ward wrote Latin <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and epigrams with elegance; also many poems in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> of great beauty and feeling. Some of the former were printed in the "Acta S. Rumoldi".
