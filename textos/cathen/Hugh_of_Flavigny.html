<h1>Hugh of Flavigny</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and historian; b. about 1064, probably at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> (Lorraine); d. before the middle of the twelfth century. He belonged to a prominent <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Vannes at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, where he afterwards took the habit of a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>. As Bishop Dietrich of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> was a supporter of the emperor and his <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Vannes, who supported the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was forced to leave his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He went to the Abbey of St-B&eacute;nigne at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, where he was followed by nearly all of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, including Hugh. While at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> the latter made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> before the Abbot Jarento, a strong adherent of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party and an enthusiastic personal friend of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>. Abbot Jarento soon gave Hugh his entire confidence; Archbishop Hugh of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> was also most friendly towards the young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and often requisitioned his services. In 1096, notwithstanding his youth, Hugh was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Flavigny, but soon became involved in disputes, not only with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, in whose diocese he was, but also with his own <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who wished to make use of all, even dishonest, means in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> behalf. On account of these differences, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> on two occasions to flee, and finally to abdicate, although the Council of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> (in 1100) ordered him to be reinstated. These bitter experiences gradually brought about a complete change in his politico-religious views on the question of investitures. From a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, self-sacrificing champion, he became a determined adversary of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims, even going so far in his opposition as to accept from Bishop Richard of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, a follower of the emperor, the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, after Abbot Laurentius, who supported the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, had been quite illegally dispossessed. But he only succeeded in maintaining this position from 1111 to 1114, after which he seems to have lived in strict seclusion at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> as a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>.

<p>As early as his sojourn at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> probably at the instance of Abbot Jarento and Archbishop Hugh, he had begun a chronicle of the world's history from the birth of Christ down to his own times (Chronicon Virdunense seu Flaviniacense). This we possess in two books: the first, which extends to the year 1002, is little more than a loosely planned compilation, and its importance is entirely due to the fragments of older lost works which it contains; the second covers the years from 1002 to 1112 and is valuable especially for the history of Lorraine, and also for the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. With wide erudition he collected a great mass of materials, and, where his facts became too unwieldy he abandoned the annalistic form for full and detailed narrative. In this manner he brings out in relief the "Acta Gregorii VII"; "Series Abbatum Flaviniacensium"; "Vita beati Richardi, abbatis S. Vitori", and "Vita S. Magdalvei". His account of the election of <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a> is a masterpiece for his period. In general, however, he cannot be said to control his materials. Making no attempt at arrangement, he quotes original documents, his own experiences, or the testimony of others, to whose tales he often gives more credit than they deserve. A complete edition of the Chronicle is given in the "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script.", VIII, 288-502, and in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> P.L., CLIV, 21-404.
