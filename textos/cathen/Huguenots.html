<h1>Huguenots</h1>  

<p>A name by which the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are often designated. Its etymology is uncertain. According to some the word is a popular corruption of the German <em>Eidgenossen</em> (conspirators, confederates), which was used at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> to designate the champions of liberty and of union with the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederation, as distinguished from those who were in favour of submission to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. The close connection of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> with Geneva, in the time of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, might have caused this name to be given to them a little before the year 1550 under the form <em>eigenots</em> (or <em>aignots</em>), which became <em>huguenots</em> under the influence of <em>Hugues</em>, Bezanson Hugues being one of their chiefs. Others have maintained that the word was first used at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and was applied to the early <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, because they were wont to assemble near the gate named after Hugon, a Count of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> in ancient times, who had left a record of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds and had become in popular fancy a sort of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">sinister</a> and maleficent genius. This name the people applied in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and derision to those who were elsewhere called <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, and from Touraine it spread throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This derivation would account for the form <em>Hugonots</em>, which is found in the correspondence of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> ambassadors and in the documents of the Vatican archives, and for that of <em>Huguenots</em>, which eventually prevailed in the usage of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, conveying a slight shade of contempt or hostility, which accounts for its complete exclusion from official documents of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Those to whom it was applied called themselves the <em>R&eacute;form&eacute;s</em> (Reformed); the official documents from the end of the sixteenth century to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> usually call them the <em>pr&eacute;tendus r&eacute;form&eacute;s</em> (pseudo-reformed). Since the eighteenth century they have been commonly designated "French <em>Protestants</em>", the title being suggested by their German co-religionists, or <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm"><em>Calvinists</em></a>, as being disciples of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>.
<h2>Origin</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> received from <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> its first organization and the form which has since become traditional; but to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> it owed the impulse which gave it birth. That the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of these two <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were to a certain degree successful in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was due in that country, as elsewhere, to the prevailing <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude. The <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Western Schism</a>, the progress of Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Louis XII against <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> had considerably weakened the prestige and authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, owing to the conduct of many of its members, inspired but little respect. After the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> (1438) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> became the object of ceaseless rivalry and contention, while too many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ignored their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence. In spite of some attempts at reform, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> languished in inactivity, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and relaxation of discipline, and all their attendant imperfections. The <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> had created a distaste for the verbose, formalistic scholasticism, still dominant in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and had turned men back to the cult of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity, to <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>, and in some cases to unbelief. Other minds, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were led by the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> itself to the study of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, but, under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> which had shortly before this become current as a reaction from the system of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the philosophy of the <em>literati</em>, they ended by exaggerating the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. It was this class of thinkers, affected at once by <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, that took the initiative, more or less consciously, in the reform for which public opinion clamoured.

<p>Their first leader was <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples</a>, who, after devoting his early life to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and mathematics, became when nearly sixty years old an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> and the editor of French translations of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. In the preface to his "Quincuplex Psalterium", published in 1509, and in that to his commentary on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, published in 1512, he ascribes to Scripture an almost exclusive authority in matters of religion, and preaches <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even to the point of counting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> as naught. Furthermore, he sees in the Mass only a commemoration of the one Sacrifice of the Cross. In 1522 he published a Latin commentary on the Gospels, the preface to which may be regarded as the first manifesto of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Chlitoue, Farel, G&eacute;rard Roussel, Cop, Etienne Poncher, Michel d'Arande rallied around him as his disciples. Bri&ccedil;onnet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, constituted himself their protector against the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and called them to preach in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. None of these men, however, intended to carry their innovations to the point of breaking with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; they meant to remain within it; they accepted and they sought its dignities. <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre</a> became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> to Bri&ccedil;onnet; Gerard Roussel was made a canon of Meaux, then by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> appointment <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairac, and eventually <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Oloron; Michel d'Arande became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux (<em>Triscastrinensis</em>). Their aim, for the time being, was only to "preach the pure gospel", and thereby lead the people back to the genuine religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which, as they said, had been corrupted by the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They were powerfully aided in their undertaking by Margaret, Queen of Navarre, who favoured both them and their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; she was their advocate with her brother <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, and, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, their protectress against the Sorbonne.



<p>This learned body soon began to feel concern at the progress of the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Its syndic, Beda, was a man of narrow mind, of violent and sometimes ill-timed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, but of profound convictions, clear insight, and undeniably disinterested aims. Under his guidance the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, aided only by the Parliament, took the lead in the struggle with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, while the king hesitated between the parties or changed his attitude according to his political interests. Since 1520 the writings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had been spreading in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at least among the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, and his books were selling in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by hundreds. On 15 April, 1521, the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> formally condemned <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> doctrines. Stimulated by this faculty and armed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with special powers for the suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was preparing vigorous measures against <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples</a>, but the king interfered. When <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, the Parliament, on which the queen-regent placed no restraint, inaugurated in 1523 sanguinary measures of repression; not a year passed but some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was arrested and scourged or burned. The most famous of the victims in these early times was Louis de Berquin, a nobleman of Artois and a friend and councillor of the king; several <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> writings were found in his possession. At this energetic action of the Parliament the Meaux group took fright and scattered. Bri&ccedil;onnet retracted and wrote pastorals against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre</a> and Roussel escaped to Strasburg or to the dominions of the Queen of Navarre. Chlitoue wrote against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, Farel rejoined <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. But all this time <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> continued to spread in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, disseminated chiefly by the students and professors from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Again and again the king complained in his edicts of the spread of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in his kingdom. Since 1530 there had existed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a vigorous group of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, recruited principally from the literary men and the lower classes, and numbering from 300 to 400 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Some others were to be found in the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and Bourges; in the Duchy of Alencon where Margaret of Navarre, the suzerain, gave them licence to preach, and whence the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> spread in Normandy; at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> made an early appearance owing to the advent of foreigners from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; and at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, where the Parliament caused the arrest of several suspects and the burning of John of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, a professor in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>After condemning the works of Margaret of Navarre, who was inspired with the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the Sorbonne witnessed the banishment of Beda and the appointment of Cop to the rectorship of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, although he was already suspected of sympathizing with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. At the opening of the academic year, 1 November, 1533, he delivered an address filled with the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. This address had been prepared for him by a young student then scarcely known, whose influence however upon the French <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was to be considerable; this was John Calvin. Born in 1509 at Noyon in Picardy, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was secretary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and <em>promoteur</em> to the chapter (an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office analogous to the civil office of public prosecutor), he obtained his first <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> there in 1521. Two years later he went to study at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, then to Orl&eacute;ans (1528) and to Bourges for the study of law. At Bourges he became acquainted with several <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> &mdash; among others his future friend Melchior Wolmar, professor of Greek. His cousin <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan</a> had already initiated him into their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; some of these he had adopted, and he introduced them into Cop's rectorial discourse. This address called forth repressive measures against the two friends. Cop fled to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> to Saintonge. The latter soon broke with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, surrendered his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, for which he received compensation, and towards the end of 1534 betook himself to Basle in consequence of the affair of the "placards" &mdash; i.e. the violent manifestos against the Mass which, by the contrivance of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, had been placarded in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (18 October, 1534), in the provinces, and even on the door to the king's apartments. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, who until then had been divided between his will to meet the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the expediency of winning to himself the support of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, made up his mind to defer on this occasion to the demands of the exasperated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In the January following he took part in a solemn procession during the course of which six <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were burned; he let the Parliament arrest seventy-four of them a Meaux, of whom eighteen were also burned; he himself ordered by edict the extermination of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and of those who should harbour them, and promised rewards to those who should inform against them. But before the end of the year the king reversed his policy and thought of inviting <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It was at this juncture that <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> entered upon his great role of leader of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> by writing his "Institutio Christianae Religionis" (Institutes of the Christian Religion), the preface to which, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 23 August, 1535, took the form of a letter addressed to <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. It was published in Latin (March, 1536), and was at once an apology, a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a rallying signal for the partisans of the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, who were no longer <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and were hesitating in their choice between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, and the other chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> became famous; many <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> flocked to him at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, where he went to reside in 1536, making that city the home of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Thence his disciples returned to their own country to spread his writings and his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and to rally old partisans or recruit new ones. Alarmed at their progress, <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, who had just concluded a treaty with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (June, 1538), thenceforward took a decidedly hostile attitude towards <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and maintained it until his death (31 March, 1547). In 1539 and 1540 the old edicts of toleration were replaced by others which invested the tribunals and the magistrates with inquisitorial powers against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and those who shielded them. At the instance of the king the Sorbonne drew up first a formula of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in twenty-six articles, and then an index of prohibited books, in which the works of Dolet, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> appeared; the parliaments received orders to prosecute anyone who should preach a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> contrary to these articles, or circulate any of the books enumerated in the index. This unanimity of king, Sorbonne, and Parliament, it may be said, was what prevented the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> from gaining in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the easy success which it won in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The magistrates were everywhere extremely <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in enforcing the repressive edicts. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and Angers, numbers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and hawkers of prohibited books were sent to the stake. At Aix the Parliament passed a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> ordering a general massacre of the descendants of the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> grouped around M&eacute;rindol and de Cabrieres, its enforcement to be suspended for five months to give them time for conversion. After withholding his consent to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> for five years the king allowed an authorization for its execution to be wrung from him, and about eight hundred <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> were massacred &mdash; an odious deed which <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> regretted bitterly until his death. His successor, Henry II, vigorously maintained the struggle against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. In 1547 a commission &mdash; the famous <em>Chambre Ardente</em> &mdash; was created in the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the special purpose of trying <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; then in June, 1551, the Ch&acirc;teaubriant Edict codified all the measures which had previously been enacted for the defence of the Faith. This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> was enforced by the parliaments in all its rigour. It resulted in the execution of many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and Chamb&eacute;ry, and drove the rest to exasperation. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were aided by a certain number of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, by preachers from <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and Strasburg, by schoolmasters who disseminated the literature of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; they were favoured at times by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &mdash; such as those of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, of Uz&egrave;s, of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> of Oloron, of Lescar, of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>; they were supported and guided by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, who from <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> &mdash; where he was persecuting his adversaries (e.g. Cartellion), or having them burnt (e.g. Servetus) &mdash; kept up an active correspondence with his party. With these helps the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> penetrated little by little into every part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Between 1547 and 1555 some of their circles began to organize themselves into churches at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and elsewhere, but it was at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> that the first Reformed church was definitely organized in 1555. Other followed &mdash; at Meaux, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>. All of these took as their model that of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> governed; for from him proceeded the impulse which stimulated them, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that inspired them; from him, too, came nearly all the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, who put the churches into communication with that of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and its supreme head. It lacked only a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to ensure the union of the churches and uniformity of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In 1559 there was held at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the first <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a>, composed of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and elders, assembled from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; it formulated a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, drawing inspiration from the writings of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>.
<h2>Creed and institutions</h2>

<p>From this moment the French <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was established; it had its creed, its discipline, its organization. Of the forty articles of its creed those alone are of interest here which embody the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> peculiar to the Huguenots. According to these, Scripture is the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, and contains all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The canonical books of which it is formed (all those in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> canon except <a href="../bible/tob000.htm">Tobit</a>, <a href="../bible/jth000.htm">Judith</a>, <a href="../bible/wis000.htm">Wisdom</a>, <a href="../bible/sir000.htm">Sirach</a>, <a href="../bible/bar000.htm">Baruch</a>, and <a href="../bible/1ma000.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/2ma000.htm">2 Maccabees</a>) are recognized as such not by the common consent of the Churches, but by the internal testimony and persuasion of the Holy Spirit, Who causes us to discern them from other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> books. The three symbols of the Apostles, of Nicaea, and of St. Athanasius are received as conformable to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>.

<p>Man fallen through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has lost his moral integrity; his nature is utterly corrupt, and his will captive to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From this general corruption and condemnation only those are rescued whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has elected of His pure bounty and mercy in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> without consideration of their works, leaving the others under the said condemnation in order that in them His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> may be manifested. We are reconciled with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the one sacrifice which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> offered on the Cross, and our <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists entirely in the remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> assured to us by the imputation of the merits of Christ. Faith alone makes us sharers in this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is imparted to us by the hidden grace of the Holy Spirit; it is bestowed, not once for all merely to set us upon the way, but to bring us to the goal; the good deeds done by us do not enter into the reckoning as affecting our justification. The intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, oral confession, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are human inventions. The institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is Divine; it cannot exist without <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> authorized to teach; no one should live apart from it. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church is the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the faithful who agree to follow the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the pure religion which is based thereon. It ought to be governed, in obedience to the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, guardians, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. All <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> have the same authority and equal power. Their first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to preach the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; their second to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are outward signs and assured pledges of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>. There are only two: Baptism and the Supper, in which, by the hidden and incomprehensible power of His Spirit, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, though He is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, spiritually nourishes and vivifies us. In Baptism, as in the Supper, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives us that which the sacrament signifies. It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that the world be governed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and constitutions; He has established the various governments; these therefore must be obeyed.

<p>This profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the elements of which are borrowed from <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> "Institutio Christianae Religionis", evidently takes for its basis <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> principal doctrines, which are however here more methodically expounded and more rigorously <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a>. The Huguenots added to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> theories only the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in absolute <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by reason of the inamissibility of grace. They also deviated from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> in the organization of their church (which is not, as with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, absorbed in the State) and in their conception &mdash; obscure enough indeed &mdash; of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in which they see more than the empty and inefficacious signs of the Sacramentarians, and less than ceremonies conferring grace, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> conception of a sacrament.

<p>The discipline established by the Synod of 1559 was also contained in forty articles, to which others were very soon added. The primary organization with its successive developments may be reduced substantially to this: Wherever a sufficient number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were found, they were to organize in the form of a Church, i.e. appoint a consistory, call a minister, establish the regular celebration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the practice of discipline. A church provided with all the elements of organization was an <em>&eacute;glise dress&eacute;e</em>; one which had only a part of these requisites was an <em>&eacute;glise plant&eacute;e</em>. The former had one or more <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, with elders and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who composed the consistory. This consistory was in the first instance elected by the common voice of the people; after that, it co-opted its own members; but these had to receive the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the people. Pastors were elected by the provincial synod or the conference after an inquiry into their lives and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, and a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> followed. The people were notified of the election, and the newly elected <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> preached before the congregation on three consecutive <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>; the silence of the people was taken as an expression of consent. The elders, elected by those members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who were admitted to the Supper, were charged with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of watching over the flock, jointly with the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and of paying attention to all that concerned <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and government. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were elected like the elders; it was their office to administer, under the consistory, the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> collected for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to visit the sick, those in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and so on.

<p>A certain number of churches went to form a conference. The conferences assembled at least twice a year. Each church was represented by a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and an elder; the function of the conference was to settle such differences as might arise among church officers, and to provide generally for all that might be deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the maintenance and the common good of those within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Over the conferences were the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, which were in like manner composed of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and one or two elders from each church chosen by the consistory, and met at least once a year. The number of these <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> in the whole of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was at times fifteen, at other times sixteen. Doctrines, discipline, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the appointment of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, erection and delimitation of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> fell within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. At the head of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> stood the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a>, which, in so far as possible, was to meet once a year. (As a matter of fact, there were only twenty-nine between 1559 and 1660 &mdash; on an average, one every three years and a half). It was made up of two <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and two elders sent by each provincial synod, and, when fully attended, it had (sixty or) sixty-four members. To the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> it belonged to pronounce definitively upon all important matters, internal or external, disciplinary or political, which concerned religion.

<p>The complement of these various institutions was the translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into the vernacular. In 1528 <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples</a> had already completed a translation from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, making use of Jean de Rely's already existing translation, but suppressing the glosses. His translation was improved by going back to the original texts in the four editions which appeared successively before the year 1541. But the first really Huguenot version was that of <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan</a>, a relation of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a>. It was called the "Bible de Sevrieres" &mdash; the Sevri&egrave;res Bible &mdash; from the locality where it was printed. For the protocanonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> it goes to the Hebrew; for the deuterocanonical, it is in many places content with a revision of <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre's</a> text. Its <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is translated from the Greek. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> composed its preface. In 1540 there appeared an edition of it revised and corrected by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. Again there appeared at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, in 1545, another edition in which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> had a hand. A more thorough revision marks the editions of 1553, 1561, and 1563, the last two with notes taken from <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> commentaries. Finally, <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan's</a> text, more or less revised or renewed by Martin and Osterwald, became the permanent basis of the Bibles in use among <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>It was from <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, too, and from his book "La forme des pri&egrave;res et des chants eccl&eacute;siastiques" (1542), that the Huguenot liturgy was taken. Like <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a>, it embraces the suppression of the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the negation of merit in any works, even in Divine worship, the proscription of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and of the intercession of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; it attaches great importance to the preaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word and the use of the vernacular only. But the breach with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is much wider than in the case of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. Under pretext of returning to the earliest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who followed him reduced the whole liturgy to three elements: public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, preaching, and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In the Divine service for Sunday <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were either recited or chanted. At the beginning there was the public confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, the chanting of the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a> or of psalms, then a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered by the minister, followed by the sermon and a long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for princes, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, for men in general, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the sick, and so on. Besides these, there were special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, marriage, and the Supper, which last was under certain circumstances added to the Divine service.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> may be divided into four well-defined periods: (1) A Militant Period, in which it is struggling for freedom (1559-98); (2) the Period of the Edict of Nantes (1598-1685); (3) the Period from the Revocation to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> (1685-1800); (4) the Period from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> to the Separation (1801-1905).
<h3 id="A">Militant period</h3>

<p>The organization of their discipline and worship gave the Huguenots a new power of expansion. Little by little they penetrated into the ranks of the nobility. One of the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the kingdom, the Coligny, allied to the Montmorency, furnished them their most distinguished recruits in d'Andelot, Admiral Coligny, and Cardinal Odet de Chatillon. Soon the Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret, daughter of Margaret of Navarre, professed <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> and introduced it into her dominions by force. Her husband, Antoine* de Bourbon, the first prince of the blood, appeared at times to have gone over to the Huguenots with his brother the Prince de Cond&eacute;, who, for his part, never wavered in his allegiance to the new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. Even the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which had so energetically carried on the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, allowed itself to become tainted, many of its members embracing the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to deal severely with these; many were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, Antoine* du Bourg among others. But at this point Henry II died, leaving the throne to a delicate child of sixteen. Nothing could have been more advantageous for the Huguenots. Just at that time they formed a numerous group in almost every district of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Certain provinces, such as Normandy, contained as many as 5000 of them; one day 6000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at the Pr&eacute;-aux-clercs, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, sang the Psalms of Marot which the Huguenots had adopted; Basse-Guyenne, it was said, had seventy-six organized churches. Two years later, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> counted 7000 of the Reformed; Rouen, 10,000; mention is made of 20,000 at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and the Prince de Cond&eacute; presented a list of 2050 churches &mdash; which, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, cannot be identified. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> wrote to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that the kingdom was more than half Huguenot; this was assuredly an exaggeration, for the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> ambassador estimated the district contaminated with this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> at not the one-tenth part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; nevertheless it is evident that the Huguenots could no longer be regarded as a few scattered handfuls of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, whose case could be satisfactorily dealt with by a few judicial prosecutions. Organized into churches linked together by <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, reinforced by the support of great lords of whom some had access to the councils of the Crown, the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> thenceforward constituted a political power which exerted its activity in national affairs and had a history of its own.

<p>After the accession of Francis II, and through the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a>, who were all-powerful with the king and strongly devoted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, the edicts against the Huguenots were rendered still more severe. Antoine* du Bourg was burned, and a royal edict (4 September, 1559) commanded that houses in which unlawful assemblies were held should be razed and the organizers of such assemblies <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a>. Embittered by these measures, the Huguenots took advantage of every cause for discontent afforded by the government of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a>. After taking counsel with their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Geneva, they resolved to have recourse to arms. A plot was formed, the real leader of which was the Prince de Conde, though its organization was entrusted to the Sieur de la Renaudi&eacute;, a nobleman of P&eacute;rigord, who had been convicted of <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> by the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, had fled to Geneva, and had there become an ardent <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. He visited Geneva and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and scoured the provinces of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to recruit soldiers and bring them together about the Court &mdash; for the plan was to capture the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> without, as the conspirators said, laying hands on the king's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. While the Court in order to disarm Huguenot hostility was ordering its agents to desist from prosecutions, and proclaiming a general amnesty from which only preachers and conspirators were excepted, the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> were warned of the plot being hatched, and thus enabled to stifle the revolt in the blood of the conspirators who were assembling in bands about Amboise, where the king was lodged (19 March, 1560). The resentment aroused by the severity of this repression and the appointment as chancellor of Michel de L'H&ocirc;pital, a magistrate of great moderation, soon led to the adoption of less violent counsels; the Edict of Romorantin (May, 1560) softened the lot of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who had as their advocates before the "Assembly of Notables" (August, 1560) the Prince de Conde, the chancellor L'H&ocirc;pital, and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> and Vienne.

<p>The accession of Charles IX, a minor (December, 1560), brought into power, as queen regent, his mother <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a>. This was fortunate for the Huguenots. Almost indifferent to questions of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the ambitious regent made no scruple of granting any degree of toleration, provided she might enjoy her power in peace. She allowed the Conde and the Coligny to practice the reformed religion at court, and even summoned to preach there Jean de Mouluc, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> scarcely concealed by his <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>. At the same time she ordered the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to suspend the prosecutions, and authorized Huguenot worship outside of the cities until such time as a national council should have pronounced on the matter. An edict <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the month of April, while prohibiting religious manifestations, set at liberty those who had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on religious grounds. In vain did the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> try to suspend the publication of this edict; a judiciary commission composed of princes, high officers of the Crown, and members of the Royal Council, granted the Huguenots amnesty on the sole condition that they should in future live like <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In the hope of bringing about a reconciliation between the two <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> Catharine assembled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and Huguenot <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> at the Conference of Poissy. For the latter Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze spoke; for the former, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine. Each party claimed victory. In conclusion the king forbade the Huguenots to hold <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to interfere with Huguenot worship. In January, 1562, the Huguenots were authorized to hold their assemblies outside of the towns, but had to restore all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> taken from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and abstain from tumults and unlawful gatherings. This edict, however, only exasperated the rival factions; at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> it occasioned disturbances which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Catharine and the Court to flee. The <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a>, on his way from <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> to rejoin the queen, found at Vassy in Champagne some six or seven hundred Huguenots holding religious worship (1 March, 1562), which according to the Edict of January they had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to do, Vassy being a fortified town. Their singing soon interfered with the Mass at which the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a> was assisting. Mutual provocations ensued, a quarrel broke out, and blood was shed. Twenty-three Huguenots were slain and more than a hundred wounded.

<p>Forthwith, at the call of the Prince de Conde, there began the first of the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> called the "wars of religion". The Huguenots rose, as they said, to enforce respect for the Edict of January, which the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a> was trampling under foot. Everywhere the mutual animosities found vent in acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Huguenots were massacred in one place, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and religious in another. Wherever the insurgents gained the mastery, churches were sacked, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and crosses mutilated, sacred utensils profaned in sacrilegious burlesques, and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> cast into the flames. The most serious encounters took place at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a> was treacherously assassinated by a Huguenot. The assassin Poltrot de M&eacute;r&eacute; declared that he had been urged on by B&egrave;ze and Coligny. Finally, although Conde and Coligny had not been ashamed to purchase support from Queen Elizabeth of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by delivering Havre over to her, the victory remained with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Peace was established by the Edict of Amboise (19 March, 1563), which left the Huguenots freedom of worship in one town out of each bailiwick (<em>bailliage</em>) and in the castles of lords who exercised the power of life and death (<em>haute <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a></em>). Four years later there was another civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which lasted six months and ended in the Peace of Longjumeau (23 March, 1568), re-establishing the Edict of Amboise. Five months later hostilities recommenced. Conde occupied La Rochelle, but he was killed at Jarnac, and Coligny, who succeeded to his command was defeated at Moncontour. Peace was made in the following year, and the Edict of Saint-Germain (8 April, 1570) granted the Huguenots freedom of worship wherever their worship had been carried on before the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, besides leaving in their hands the four following refuges &mdash; La Rochelle, <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, La Charite, and Cognac.

<p>On his return to Court, Coligny found great favour with the king and laboured to win his support for the revolted <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. The marriage of Henry, King of Navarre, with the king's sister, Margaret of Valois, soon after this brought all the Huguenots lords to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a>, jealous of Coligny's influence with the king, and it may be in collusion with the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Duke of Guise</a> who had his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death to avenge on the admiral, plotted the death of the latter. But the attempt failed; Coligny was only wounded. Catharine, fearing reprisals from the Huguenot's, suddenly won over the king and his council to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of putting to death the Huguenot leaders assembled in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Thus occurred the odious Massacre of St. Bartholomew, so called from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whose feast fell on the same day (24 August, 1572), Admiral Coligny being slain with many of his Huguenot followers. The massacre spread to many provincial towns. The number of victims is estimated at 2000 for the capital, and 6000 to 8000 for the rest of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The king explained to foreign courts that Coligny and his partisans had organized a plot against his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and authority, and that he (the king) had merely suppressed it. Thus it was that <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> at first believed in a conspiracy of the Huguenots, and, persuaded that the king had but defended himself against these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, held a service of thanksgiving for the repression of the conspiracy, and commemorated it by having a medal struck, which he sent with his felicitations to Charles IX. There is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were in the slightest degree connected with the massacre. Cries of horror and malediction arose from the Huguenot ranks; their writers made <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the countries beyond its borders echo with those cries by means of pamphlets in which, for the first time, they attacked the absolute power, or even the very institution of royalty. After St. Bartholomew's the Huguenots, though bereft of their leaders, rushed to arms. This was the fourth civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and centred about a few fortified towns, such as La Rochelle, <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>. The Edict of Boulogne (25 June, 1573) put an end to it, granting to all Huguenots amnesty for the past and liberty to worship in those three towns. It was felt that the rising power of the Huguenots was broken &mdash; that from this juncture forward they would never again be able to sustain a conflict except by allying themselves with political malcontents. They themselves were conscious of this; they gave themselves a political organization which facilitated the mobilization of all their forces. In their <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held from 1573 to 1588 they organized <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> into <em>g&eacute;n&eacute;ralit&eacute;s</em>, placing at the head of each a general, with a permanent council and periodical assemblies. The delegates of these g&eacute;n&eacute;ralit&eacute;s were to form the States General of the Union, which were to meet every three months. Special committees were created for the recruiting of the army, the management of the finances, and the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Over the whole organization a "protector of the churches" was appointed, who was the chief of the party. Conde held this title from 1574; <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> after 1576. It was, so to say, a permanently organized revolt. In 1574 hostilities recommenced; the Huguenots and the malcontents joined forces against impotent royalty until they wrested from Henry, the successor of Charles IX (30 May, 1574), by the Edict of Beaulieu (May, 1576) the right of public worship for the religion, thenceforth officially called the <em>pr&eacute;tendue reform&eacute;e</em>, throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, except at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the Court. There were also to be established chambers composed of equal numbers of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and Huguenots in eight Parliaments; eight <em>places de suret&eacute;</em> were to be given to the Huguenots; there was to be a disclaimer of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> which had suffered from it were to be reinstated. These large concessions to the Huguenots and the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> given to their political organization led to the formation of the League, which was organized by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> anxious to defend their religion. The States-General of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> (December, 1576) declared itself against the Edict of Beaulieu. Thereupon the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> took up arms under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, who, escaping from the Court, had returned to the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> which he had <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> at the time of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. The advantage was on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, thanks to some successes achieved by the Duke of Anjou, the king's brother. The Peace of Bergerac, confirmed by the Edict of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (September, 1577), left the Huguenots the free exercise of their religion only in the suburbs of one town in each bailiwick (<em>bailliage</em>), and in those places where it had been practised before the outbreak of hostilities and which they occupied at the current date.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a>, which served to fill up the intervals between armed struggles, give us a glimpse into the forces at work in the interior life of the Huguenot party. The complaints made at their <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> show clearly that the fervour of their early days had disappeared; laxity and dissensions were finding their way into their ranks, and at times <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and their flocks were at variance. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to forbid <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to publish anything touching religious controversies or political affairs without the express approval of their conferences, and the consistories were asked (1581) to stem the ever-widening wave of dissolution which threatened their church. A <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> ambassador writes at this period that the number of Huguenots had decreased by seventy per cent. But the death of the Duke of Anjou on 10 June, 1584, the sole surviving heir of the direct line of the Valois, revived their hopes, since the King of Navarre thus became heir presumptive to the throne. The prospect thus opened aroused the League; it called upon Henry III to <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> Huguenot worship everywhere, and to declare the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> incapable of holding any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or public offices &mdash; and consequently the King of Navarre incapable of succeeding to the throne. By the Convention of Nemours (7 July, 1585) the king accepted these conditions; he revoked all previous edicts of pacification, ordered the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to leave the kingdom immediately and the other Huguenots within six months, unless they chose to be converted. This edict, it was said, sent more Huguenots to Mass than St. Bartholomew's had, and resulted in the disappearance of all their churches north of the Loire; it was therefore impossible for them to profit by the hostilities which broke out between the king and the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a>, and resulted in the assassination of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> at the States-General of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> (23 December, 1588) and the death of Henry III at the siege of the revolted city of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1 August, 1589). <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> succeeded as Henry IV, after promising the Royalist <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had joined him that he would seek guidance and instruction from a council to be held within six months, or sooner if possible, and that in the meantime he would maintain the exclusive practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in all those places where the Huguenot religion was not actually being practised. Circumstances prevented him from keeping his word. The League held <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the principal towns of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he was forced into a long struggle against it, in which he was enabled to secure victory only after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> (July, 1593), and, above all, after his reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (September, 1595). The Huguenots had meanwhile been able to obtain from him only the measure of tolerance guaranteed by the Edict of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>; they had profited by this to reopen at <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a> (June, 1594) the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> which had been interrupted for eleven years. They soon completed their political organization in the Assemblies of Saumur and Loudun, they extended it to the whole of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and claimed to treat with the king as equal with equal, bargaining with him for their help against the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, refusing him their contingents at the siege of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, withdrawing them in the midst of a campaign during the siege of La F&egrave;re. Thus they brought the king, who was besides anxious to end the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to grant them the Edict of Nantes (April-May, 1598).
<h3 id="B">Under the Edict of Nantes</h3>

<p>This edict, containing 93 public and 36 secret articles, provided in the first place that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion should be re-established wherever it had been suppressed, together with all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> previously enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The Huguenots obtained the free exercise of their religious worship in all places where it actually existed, as also in two localities in every bailiwick (<em>bailliage</em>), in castles of lords possessing the right of life and death, and even in those of the ordinary nobles in which the number of the faithful did not exceed thirty. They were eligible for all public offices, for admission to colleges and academies, could hold <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and even political meetings; they received 45,000 crowns annually for expenses of worship and support of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; they were given in the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a tribunal in which their representatives constituted one-third of the members, while in those of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> special chambers were created, half of whose members were Huguenot. One hundred <em>places de suret&eacute;</em> were ceded to them for eight years, and, while the king paid the garrison of these fortresses, he named the governors only with the assent of the churches. If many of these provisions are nowadays recognized by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, some on the other hand would seem incompatible with orderly government. This condition of benevolent and explicit tolerance was entirely new for the Huguenots. Many of them considered that too little had been yielded to them, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> thought that they had been given too much. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> energetically complained of the edict to Cardinal d'Ossat, the king's ambassador; the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> protested against it; and many of the parliaments refused for a long time to register it. Henry IV succeeded finally in imposing his will on all parties, and for some years the Edict of Nantes ensured the religious peace of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Huguenots, possessing at that time 773 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, enjoyed during the reign of Henry IV the most perfect calm; their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> was marred only by the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to make converts among them. Cardinal du Perron and many of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and other religious engaged in this work, and sometimes with great success. Upon the death of Henry IV (1610) there was at first no change in the situation of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. They did indeed raise numerous complaints in their assemblies of Saumur, <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, and Loudun, but in reality they had no grievances to allege except those due to popular intolerance with which the Government had nothing to do. Truth compels the less prejudiced among their historians to admit that the Huguenots, who complained so much of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> intolerance, were themselves just as intolerant wherever they happened to be the stronger. Not only did they retain the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and the exclusive use of the churches, but, wherever possible (as at B&eacute;arn), they even opposed the enforcement of those clauses of the Edict of Nantes which were favourable to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They went so far as to prohibit <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in the towns that had been ceded to them. It was with the greatest difficulty that Sully, the minister of Henry IV and himself a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, could obtain for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> permission to enter the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, when summoned to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and authorization to bury, with never so little solemnity, their dead co-religionists. To this intolerance, which often explains the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, they added the imprudence of showing themselves ever ready to make common cause with the domestic enemies of the State, or with any lords who might be in revolt. In 1616, in Guyenne, Languedoc, and Piotou, they allied themselves with Rohan and Conde, who had risen against the queen regent, Marie de' Medici. They again got restless when the king, conformably with the Edict of Nantes, re-established <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> at B&eacute;arn. An assembly, held at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> despite the king's prohibition, divided the realm into eight military circles, and among other matters provided for plundering the king's revenues and the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To deal with this condition of affairs the king was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to capture Saumur, Thouars, and other rebellious towns. He laid siege to <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, which city, defended by Rohan and La Force, repelled all his assaults. Lastly he invested Montpellier and had no better success; nevertheless peace was signed there (October, 1622), according to which the Edict of Nantes was confirmed, political meetings were forbidden, and the cities which had been won from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> remained in the king's hands. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal de Richelieu</a>, when he became prime minister, entertained the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of putting an end to the political power of the Huguenots while respecting their religious liberty. Rohan and Soubise, on the pretext that the Edict of Nantes had been violated, quickly effected an uprising of the South of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and did not hesitate to make an alliance with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as a result of which an English fleet of ninety vessels manned by 10,000 men endeavoured to effect a landing at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> (July, 1627). The king and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> laid siege to this stronghold of the revolted Huguenots; they drove off the English fleet, and even made its approach to the place impossible in future by means of a mole about 1640 yards long which they constructed. In spite of the fanatical heroism of the mayor Guiton and his co-religionists, La Rochelle was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to capitulate. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> used his victory with moderation; he left the inhabitants the free exercise of their religion, granted them a full amnesty, and restored all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to its owners. Rohan, pursued by Conde and Epernon, kept up the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, not disdaining to accept succour from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but he was at last <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to sign the Peace of Alais, by which the Edict of Nantes was renewed, an amnesty promised, the cities taken from the Huguenots, and the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> brought to an end (June, 1629). Subsequently <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> disappeared from the stage of politics, content to enjoy in peace the advantages of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> which were still accorded to it. The strife was transferred to the field of controversy. Public lectures, polemical and erudite writings, were multiplied, and preachers and professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> &mdash; such as Chamier, Amyraut, Rivet, Basnage, Blondel, Daill&eacute;, Bochart &mdash; demonstrated their industry, learning, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, more and more affected by the beneficent influence of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, opposed them with vigorous and learned controversialists, with prudent and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> preachers, such as <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a>, Labbe, Coton, <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, Cosp&eacute;an, <a href="../cathen/09142a.htm">Lejeune</a>, S&eacute;nault, Tenouillet, <a href="../cathen/04091a.htm">Coeffeteau</a>, <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">de B&eacute;rulle</a>, Condren, whose success was manifested in numerous conversions. These conversions took place especially in the higher circles of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; the great lords abandoned <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, which retained its influence only among the middle classes. Excluded from the public service, the Huguenots became manufacturers, merchants, and farmers; the number of their churches decreased to 630; their religious activity lessened; between 1631 and 1659 they held only four <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Without being sympathetic towards them, the public authorities respected the religious liberty guaranteed by the Edict of Nantes. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> judged that the scope of that edict should not be widened, nor should the liberties there granted be curtailed, and even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians pay tribute to his moderation. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> being a minor at his accession, his mother, Anne of Austria, began her regency by promising to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> the enjoyment of their liberties. <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> abstained from disturbing them. "If the little flock", he said, "feeds on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> weeds, it does not wander away" (Si le petit troupeau broute de mauvaises herbes, il ne s'&eacute;carte pas). It is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that some of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords, the Duc de Bouillon among others, when they gave up <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, caused the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> within their jurisdictions to be closed; but the Edict of Nantes permitted this, and the Government had neither the right nor the inclination to prevent it. In 1648, when Alsace with the exception of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> was reunited with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, liberty of public worship was maintained for all the new subjects who were of the Augsburg Confession. In 1649 the Royal Council, dealing with certain complaints of the Huguenots, declared that those of the "pseudo-reformed" (<em>pr&eacute;tendue r&eacute;form&eacute;e</em>) religion should not be disturbed in the practice of their worship, and ordered the reopening of some of their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> which had been closed. Thus the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister Jurieu could write that the years between the Rising of the Fronde and the Peace of the Pyrenees were among the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiest</a> within the memory of his creed.

<p>In proportion as <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> got the reins of government into his own hands, the position of the Huguenots became increasingly unfavourable. After 1660 they were forbidden to hold <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a>. At that time they counted 623 churches served by 723 <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, who ministered to about 1,200,000 members. A commission, established in 1661 to inquire into the titles on which their places of worship were held, brought about the demolition of more than 100 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, for which no warrant could be found in the provisions of the Edict of Nantes. A royal order of 1663 deprived relapsed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> &mdash; i.e. those who had returned to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> after having <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> it &mdash; of the benefit of the Edict of Nantes, and condemned them to perpetual banishment. A year later, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, this order was suspended, and proceedings under it were arrested. Then, by another ordinance, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were authorized to present themselves with a magistrate at the domicile of any sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and to ask whether such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> wished to die in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or to be converted to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion; the children of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were declared competent to embrace <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> at the age of seven, their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make an allowance for their separate support conformably with their station in life. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> soon saw themselves excluded from public office; the chambers in which the parties were equally represented were suppressed, Huguenot preaching was restrained and emigration was forbidden under pain of confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>These measures and others of less importance were taken chiefly in response to demands made by the Assemblies of the Clergy or by public opinion. Their efficacy was augmented by the controversial works, those of Bosseut, "Exposition de la doctrine catholique", "Avertissement aux Protestants", "Histoire des variations des Eglises protestantes", being conspicuously brilliant, to which the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> &mdash; Claude, Jurieu, Pajon &mdash; replied but feebly. Meanwhile the commissioners (<em>intendants</em>) were working with all their might to bring about conversions of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, to which end some of them made as much use of dragoons as they did missionaries, so that their system of making converts by force rather than by conviction came to be branded with the name of <em>dragonnade</em>.
<h3 id="C">From the revocation of the Edict of Nantes to the Revolution</h3>

<p>Trusting in the number and sincerity of these conversions, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> thought it no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to observe half measures with the Huguenots, and consequently revoked the Edict of Nantes on 18 October, 1685. Thenceforward the exercise of public worship was forbidden to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; their churches were to be demolished; they were prohibited from assembling for the practice of their religion in private houses. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> who would not be converted were ordered to leave the kingdom within fifteen days. Parents were forbidden to instruct their children in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and ordered to have them <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and sent to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Four months' grace was granted the fugitive <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and recover their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; after the lapse of this period the said <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> would be definitively confiscated. Emigration was forbidden for men under pain of the galleys, and for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> under pain of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Subject to these conditions <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> might live within the realm, carry on commerce, and enjoy their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> without being molested on account of their religion. This measure, which was regrettable from many points of view, evoked in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> unanimous applause from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of all classes. With the exception of Vauban and Saint-Simon, all the great men of that period highly approved of the revocation. This attitude is explained by the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the time. Tolerance was almost unknown in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and, in those countries where they had the ascendancy, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> had been long inflicting upon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> a treatment harder than they themselves underwent in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At Geneva and in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was absolutely forbidden; in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, after the Peace of Augsburg, all subjects were bound to take the religion of their prince, in accordance with the adage: <em>Cujus regio ejus religio</em>. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which even forced those who dissented from the Established Church to seek religious liberty in America, treated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> more harshly than did Turkey; all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were banished from the country; should one of them return and be caught in the exercise of his functions, he was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>; a heavy tribute was imposed upon Papists, as though they were slaves.

<p>The Revocation did not produce the effect intended by its author. Scarcely had it been published when, in spite of all prohibitions, a mighty movement of emigration developed in the provinces adjacent to the frontiers. Vauban had to write that the "Revocation brought about the desertion of 100,000 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, the exportation of 60,000,000 livres ($12,000,000), the ruin of commerce; enemies' fleets were reinforced by 9000 sailors, the best in the kingdom, and foreign armies by 600 officers and 1200 men, more inured to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> than their own." Those who remained took advantage of the last article of the Revocation to dispense with attendance at church and the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> at the hour of death. The king in his embarrassment consulted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <em>intendants</em>, and their replies inclined him to relax the execution of the edict of revocation somewhat, without changing anything in its letter. On the other hand, a few preachers remained in spite of the Revocation, and clandestinely organized their worship in the fields and in remote places, or, as the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians express it, "in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>". Of this number were Brousson, Corteiz, and Regnart. In the Vivarais the management of the churches passed into the hands of the <em>illumin&eacute;s</em> &mdash; fanatical preachers, peasants, and young girls &mdash; who stirred up the population with prophesies of the approaching triumph of their cause. Three armies and three marshals of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had to march against these insurgents (the <em>Camisards</em>), who were reduced to order only after a struggle of five or six years' duration (1702-1708).

<p>From that time the churches lived only as secret associations, without religious worship and without regular gatherings. The <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> were hunted into hiding, those who were caught being mercilessly <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Still, some of them were not afraid to risk their lives; the best known of these, Antoine* Court (1696-1760), spent nearly twenty years in this secret labour, travelling through the South, and distributing propagandist or polemical tracts, holding numerous meetings "in the desert", and even organizing semblances of <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> in 1715, and <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a> in 1726. Retiring to Lausanne in 1729, he founded there a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> ministry in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This condition of official <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and hidden vitality lasted until after the middle of the eighteenth century. The authorities continued to hang <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and destroy churches until 1762; but <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of toleration had for some time been gradually finding their way into the mind of the nation; prosecutions for religious offences became unpopular, especially after the <a href="../cathen/03149a.htm">Calas affair</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> of that name at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> was charged with having killed one of his sons to prevent his becoming a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Arrested and condemned on this charge by the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (9 March, 1762), he was executed at the age of sixty-eight after a trial which created great excitement. His <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> and children demanded <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Voltaire took up their cause and succeeded by his writings in arousing the public opinion of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> against the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The Supreme Council (<em>Grand Conseil</em>) unanimously reversed the judgment of the Parliament, and another tribunal rehabilitated the memory of <a href="../cathen/03149a.htm">Calas</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> derived great benefit from the trend of public feeling resulting from this rehabilitation. Without any legislative change as yet, the modification of public opinion incessantly tended to the improvement of their lot, and the Government treated them with a tacit toleration. At last, in 1787, a decided amelioration of their condition came with the Edict of Toleration, which granted to non-Catholics the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to practise a profession or handicraft without molestation, permission to be legally married before magistrates, and to have births officially recorded. In practice these liberties went even farther, and churches were openly organized. Two years later complete liberty and access to all employments were recognized as belonging to them, no less than to other citizens, by the "Declaration of the Rights of Man", voted by the Constituent Assembly (August, 1789). This legislative body, which for a short period (March, 1790) was presided over by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Rabaud, went so far as to order that the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of those who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> under the Revocation should be restored to their descendants, who might even recover their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as French citizens on condition that they took up their residence in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> had to suffer, like <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, though <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> less, from the sectarian and anti-religious spirit of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; churches vanished during the Reign of Terror; religious worship could not be reorganized until about the year 1800.
<h3 id="D">From the Revolution to the separation (1801-1905)</h3>

<p>When order was restored the Huguenots were included in the measures initiated by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> for pacifying the nation. They received from him an entirely new organization. At this time there were in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> about 430,000 <em>R&eacute;form&eacute;s</em>. By the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 18 Germinal, Year X (7 April, 1802), there was to be a consistorial church for every 6000 believers, and five consistorial churches were to form a synod. The consistory of each church was to be composed of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and the leading elders. They were entrusted with the maintenance of discipline, the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and the election of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, whose names had, however, to be submitted for the approval of the head of the State. Each synod was composed of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and an elder from each of the churches, and had to superintend public worship and religious instruction. It could assemble only with the consent of the Government under the presidency of the prefect or the sub-prefect, and for not longer than six days. Its enactments had to be submitted for approval to the head of the State. There was no <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a>. The churches of the Augsburg Confession, chiefly in Alsace, had, instead of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, boards of inspection subordinate to three general consistories. Salaries were guaranteed to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, who were exempt from military service. The old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> was transferred to Geneva, at that time a French city, and then to Montauban (1809) and annexed to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> as a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. For the churches of the Augsburg Confession, two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> or faculties were to be erected in the east of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Politically, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> had no further modifications to undergo, whatever changes of government there might be. In the early days of the Restoration its members had, indeed, a certain amount of rough usage to suffer in some of the cities of the south, but this was the work of local animosity or of personal vengeance, and the public authorities had no part in it. The churches laboured to adapt themselves as well as possible to the system of organization that had been imposed on them.

<p>In 1806, after <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> conquests, there were 76 consistories with 171 <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of their churches was very languid; indifference reigned everywhere. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Boistard complained that out of 10,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> hardly fifty or a hundred attended worship regularly &mdash; two or three hundred at most during the fine season. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, hastily prepared for their work at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, brought back generally with them <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendencies; they were content to fulfil the routine <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their profession. Their preaching dwelt upon the commonplaces of morality or of natural religion. Two tendencies in regard to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> were beginning to reveal themselves. One of these was represented by Daniel Encoutre, dean of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, and was directed towards rigid <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, based firmly on <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and confessions; the other was championed especially by Samuel Vincent, one of the most respected <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the time, and put religious feeling above <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and morality, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> being according to this view a life rather than an aggregate of facts and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. The movement known as the <em>R&eacute;veil</em> (Awakening) helped to accentuate this divergence. The men who constituted themselves its propagators in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the first years of the Restoration were disciples of Wesley. They insisted, in their sermons, on the absolute powerlessness of man to save himself by his own efforts, upon <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, upon individual conversion, and were animated by a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the saving of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the preaching of the Gospel which contrasted strangely with the indolence of the official <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. The <em>R&eacute;veil</em> was ill received by the two sections into which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was beginning to divide. The <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, while accepting its doctrines, did not sympathize with its efforts at a renewal of the spiritual life, of renunciation and sacrifice, and of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for saving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. This they plainly showed at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> where they effected the removal of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Adolphe Monod, who had wished to introduce <em>R&eacute;veil</em> practices. For the representatives of the liberal tendencies, the preaching of the <em>R&eacute;veil</em> was nothing but a collection of superannuated doctrines, in opposition alike to what they called the spirit of the Gospel and to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and aspirations of modern <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>.

<p>These three tendencies grew farther apart from day to day. The friends of <em>R&eacute;veil</em>, sometimes called <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, severed their connection with the Reformed Churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and organized in 1830 in the Rue Taitbout, Paris, a free Church of which Edmond de Pressense soon became the most noted leader. In their profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and their disciplinary regulations they emphasized the individual character of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> independence of the State, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of maintaining a propaganda. Some of them, with the periodical "L'Esperance" for their organ, refused to break with the National Church. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, who were at first called Latitudinarians or <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>, repudiated the earlier confessions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> by absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and illumination by irresistible grace, and the whole body of their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> &mdash; according to M. Nicolas, one of their number &mdash; consisted in "avoiding <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> exaggerations". A <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 1848, consisting of fifty-two <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and thirty-eight elders, increased the existing divisions. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> obtained the presidency, and, in deference to their wishes, the question of confessions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was set aside by an almost unanimous vote, the synod contenting itself with drawing up an address in which the majority set forth the principles common to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, namely, respect for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in historical and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But as the assembly refused to re-establish a clear and positive profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> Frederic Monod, Amal, and Cambon left the official Church, and issued an appeal to all the independent churches which had been formed by the labours of isolated evangelists. In 1849 they held a synod, in which thirteen of these already formed churches and eighteen which were in process of formation were represented, voted a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and established the "Union of the Free Evangelical Churches of France" (Union des eglises &eacute;vang&eacute;liques libres de France).

<p>All these divisions made a civil reorganization of the churches desirable; it was effected by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Louis Napoleon</a>, who was then President of the Republic. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> reconstituted the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, placing them under a presbyterial council of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and elders. At the head of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> so constituted was a central council, the members of which were appointed by the Government; its function was merely to represent the churches in their relations with the head of the State, without possessing any religious or disciplinary authority. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran churches</a> were placed under the authority of the Superior Consistory and of a Directory. The only subsequent modification in the status of these churches resulted from the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> annexation, after the War of 1870, of the Alsatian territories, where there were a great many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran churches</a> by this event lost two-thirds of their membership, and their faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> had to be transferred from <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where it augmented the strength of the Liberal section. The gulf between the two parties still continued to widen. The Orthodox vainly endeavoured, by abandoning the formulae of the old <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and by rejecting all but the great facts and essential doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, to maintain their position; the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, following the lead of the "Revuede Strasbourg", displayed an ever greater readiness to welcome the most radical conclusions of German <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> criticism, particularly those of the T&uuml;bingen School. The authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Redemption, of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, were successively abandoned. M. P&eacute;caut, a representative of this tendency, even wrote in 1859 a book (Le Christ et la <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>) in which he called in question the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">moral perfection</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Others &mdash; and among them <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> such as Athanase Coquerel the Younger, Albert R&eacute;ville, and Paschoud &mdash; did not conceal their sympathy for Renan's "Vie de J&eacute;sus". The two last named of these, indeed, were deprived of their churches by the council; they of course asserted in defence of their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> &mdash; as, for that matter, did all the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> &mdash; that they had only used the right of free inquiry &mdash; the right which constitutes the whole of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was based on the right of every man to interpret the Scriptures according to his own lights. Their opponents replied that, if this were so, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was impossible; that a common worship presupposes common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. This question brought on many lively discussions between the representatives of the two tendencies in the Press, at the conferences, and in the elections for the presbyterial councils. To restore peace, a general synod had to be convoked with the consent of the Government in June, 1872. Here the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> had a majority; a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was carried by sixty-one votes to forty-five, and subscription to it was made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> upon all the young <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. This decision became an insurmountable barrier between the two parties. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, not content with repudiating the notion of any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, refused, so long as it was maintained, to take any part in the synod of 1872, and have also abstained from participating in any of the general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, which have been held about every three years since 1879, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, Sedan, Auduze and elsewhere, and from which the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party have taken the name of "the Synodal Church". For all that, the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> had no intention of breaking with the organization recognized by the State. Numerous attempts have been made in the last thirty years, to bring about an understanding between the two parties, but have not succeeded in establishing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> unity. The Separation seems calculated rather to increase the divisions, and already a third party has been formed by the fusion at Jarnac (1 October, 1906) of 65 Liberal churches and 40 Synodal under the name of the "Union des Eglises Reform&eacute;es".

<p>Divided among themselves on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> questions, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have by no means lost their solidarity in regard to external activities. The movement of spiritual renovation which followed the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> produced among them various propagandist, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and benevolent enterprises, such as the "Societe biblique" (1819), the "Societe des traites religieux" (1861), the "Societe des missions &eacute;vang&eacute;liques de Paris" (1824), the Society for the Promotion of Primary Instruction among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (1829), the Institution of Deaconesses (1841), the agricultural colony of Sainte-Toy (1842), and divers <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, homes for neglected children, and primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Of these last, the greater number (about 2000) have been closed since 1882. The missionary activity of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> has been chiefly exerted through the "Societe des missions &eacute;vang&eacute;liques de Paris", at Bassoutos (South Africa), where they count at the present time 15,000 adherents, with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a printing press; in <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>, where a large number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are dependent on them (117 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, according to statistics for 1908, with 7500 pupils); in Senegal, in French Congo, in Zambesi, Tahiti, and New Caledonia. Some sixty missionaries are at work on these missions, and in late years they have received an annual grant amounting to about 320,000 dollars. At home their propaganda is carried on chiefly among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population by the "Societe centrale protestante d'evangelisation", with a budget of 90,000 dollars per annum; by the "Societe &eacute;vang&eacute;liquede France", which in some years has received as much as 24,000 dollars; by the "Mission populaire &eacute;vang&eacute;lique" (MacAll) without, however, any appreciable success.

<p>Journalistic enterprise has not been overlooked. The first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> periodical, the "Archives du christianisme", was founded in 1818; then came the "Annales protestantes" in 1820, the "M&eacute;langes de la religion" in the same year, "Revue protestante" and the "Lien" in 1841, the "Evang&eacute;liste" in 1837, the "Esp&eacute;rance" in 1838, the "Revuede Strasbourg" in 1859, the "Revue th&eacute;ologique", the "Protestant", the "Vie Nouvelle", the "Revue chr&eacute;tienne", and the "Signal", a political journal. Only the best-known periodicals are mentioned here; most of them have disappeared; many are, or have been, the organs of particular sections of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. There must still be, according to the "Agenda, annuaire protestant", more than 150 in existence, but the majority have only a restricted circulation, and, excepting the "Bulletin historique et litt&eacute;raire de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'histoire du protestantisme fran&ccedil;ais" (1852), are practically without readers outside of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> world.

<p>At present <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> counts about 650,000 adherents in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> &mdash; 560,000 R&eacute;form&eacute;s, 80,000 <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, and 10,000 independents &mdash; that is a little less than one-sixtieth of the population. This seemingly negligible minority has, as everyone admits, made for itself in politics and in the executive government a place out of all proportion to its numerical strength. From a religious point of view <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> shows no indications of progress; its doctrines are daily losing ground, above all in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> circles. There, as recently declared by M. Edmond Stapfer, dean of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in the "Revue Chr&eacute;tienne", "people no longer want most of the traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>; they no longer want the dogmatic system, used by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> and the <em>R&eacute;veil</em>, in which many 'evangelical' <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> still believe, or by their silence leave the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to conclude that they still believe . . . . The intellectuals will have no more of these antiquities, they do not go to hear the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> preach; they are <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostics</a>; they respectfully salute the ancient <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, but they get on without them, and have no need of them either for their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or their moral life." Indeed it does not appear that the practice of religion has any more vitality among the masses than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has among the intellectuals. Official reports made to the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> testify that "the number of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> is increasing, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is diminishing. . . . In certain districts the number is sometimes as many as 95 per cent; even in the very <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts, we know of 25 per cent in one place and 20 per cent in others, and as high as 50 per cent of unions of this kind." As for attendance at public worship: "Here", says one report made to the General Synod of Bordeaux (1899), "are the figures for a section of the country which must be classed among the best, that of the Pyrenees. The average of attendance is 32 per cent. It does not go so high everywhere; in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for example, it reaches only 11 per cent, and in some churches of Poitou we must go still lower . . . to averages of 5 per cent. The same difference is found in the number of communicants: here it is 12 per cent; there, 4 or even 3 per cent." These are results which would doubtless have astonished and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, but which are sufficiently explained by the theory of free inquiry and the intimate history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, especially during the last century.
