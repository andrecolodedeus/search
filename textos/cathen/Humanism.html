<h1>Humanism</h1>  

<p>Humanism is the name given to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, literary, and scientific movement of the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, a movement which aimed at basing every branch of learning on the literature and culture of classical antiquity.

<p>Believing that a classical training alone could form a perfect man, the Humanists so called themselves in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, and adopted the term <em>humaniora</em> (the humanities) as signifying the scholarship of the ancients. Though the interval between the classical period and their own days was regarded by the Humanists as barbarous and destructive alike of art and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, Humanism (like every other historical phenomenon) was connected with the past. The use of Latin in the Liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had already prepared <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for the humanistic movement. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, however, classical literature was regarded merely as a means of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; it was known through secondary sources only, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> saw in the worldly conception of life that had prevailed among the ancients an allurement to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On the rise of secularism these views underwent a change, especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In that country the body politic had grown powerful, the cities had amassed great wealth, and civic liberty was widespread. Worldly pleasure became a strong factor in life and freer play was given to sensory impulse. The <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a>, unworldly concept of life, which had till then been dominant, now came into conflict with a mundane, human, and naturalistic view, which centred on nature and man. These new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> found their prototypes in antiquity, whose writers cherished and extolled the enjoyment of life, the claims of individuality, literary art and fame, the beauty of nature. Not only ancient Roman culture but also the hitherto neglected Greek culture was taken up by the movement. The new spirit broke away from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and Church. The principle of free, scientific inquiry gained ground. It was quite natural that the value of the new ideal should be exaggerated while the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> national culture was undervalued.

<p>It is customary to begin the history of Humanism with <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> (1265-1321), and <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> (1304-74). Of the two <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, by reason of his poetic sublimity, was undoubtedly the greater; but, as regards Humanism <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> was merely its precursor while <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> initiated the movement and led it on to success. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> certainly shows traces of the coming change; in his great epic classical and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> materials are found side by side, while poetic renown, an aim so characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> writers yet so foreign to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal, is what he seeks. In matters of real importance, however, he takes the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> as his guides. <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, on the other hand, is the first Humanist; he is interested only in the ancients and in poetry. He unearths long-lost <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the classics, and collects ancient medals and <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. If <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> ignored the monuments of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and regarded its ancient <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> images, <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> views the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> with the enthusiasm of a Humanist, not with that of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The ancient classics &#151; especially his lodestars, Virgil and Cicero &#151; serve not merely to instruct and to charm him; they also incite him to imitation. With the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of old he declared virtue and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be the highest goal of human endeavour, although in practice he was not always fastidious in cultivating them. However, it was only in his third aim, eloquence, that he rivalled the ancients. His ascent of Mont Ventoux marks an epoch in the history of literature. His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the beauty of nature, his susceptibility to the influence of landscape, his deep sympathy with, and glorious portrayal of, the charms of the world around him were a break with the traditions of the past. In 1341 he gained at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the much coveted crown of the poet laureate. His Latin writings were most highly prized by his contemporaries, who ranked his "Africa" with the "&AElig;neid" of Virgil, but posterity prefers his sweet, melodious sonnets and canzoni. His chief merit was the impulse he gave to the search for the lost treasures of classical antiquity. His chief disciple and friend, <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccaccio</a> (1313-75), was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in his lifetime not for his erotic and lewd, though elegant and clever, "Decameron" (by which, however, posterity remembers him), but for his Latin works which helped to spread Humanism. The classical studies of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> and <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccaccio</a> were shared by <a href="../cathen/13405b.htm">Coluccio Salutato</a> (d. 1406), the Florentine chancellor. By introducing the epistolary style of the ancients he brought classical wisdom into the service of the State, and by his tastes and his prominence greatly promoted the cause of literature.

<p>The men of the revival were soon followed by a generation of itinerant teachers and their scholars. Grammarians and rhetoricians journeyed from city to city, and spread the enthusiasm for antiquity to ever-widening circles; students travelled from place to place to become acquainted with the niceties of an author's style and his interpretation. <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> lived to see Giovanni di Conversino set out on his journey as itinerant professor. From <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> came Giovanni Malpaghini, gifted with a marvellous memory and a burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the new studies, though more skilled in imparting inherited and acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> than in the elaboration of original thought. In another way the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of literary research was Poggio (1380-1459), a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary and later Florentine chancellor. During the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414-18) he ransacked the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and institutions of the neighbourhood, made valuable discoveries, and "saved many works" from the "cells" (<em>ergastula</em>). He found and transcribed Quintilian with his own hand, had the first copies made of Lucretius, Silius Italicus, and Ammianus Marcellinus, and, probably, he discovered the first books of the "Annals" of Tacitus. About 1430 practically all the Latin works now known had been collected, and scholars could devote themselves to the revision of the text. But the real source of classic beauty was Greek literature. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> had already gone to Greece to study the language, and since 1396 <a href="../cathen/09614a.htm">Manuel Chrysoloras</a>, the first teacher of Greek in the West, was busily engaged at Florence and elsewhere. His example was followed by others. In Greece also, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> search was instituted for literary remains, and in 1423 <a href="../cathen/02112a.htm">Aurispa</a> brought two hundred and thirty-eight volumes to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The most diligent collector of inscriptions, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, gems, and medals was the merchant Ciriaco of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. Among those present from <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> were <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, who presented to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> his valuable collection of nine hundred volumes, also <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Gemistos Plethon</a>, the celebrated teacher of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> philosophy, who subsequently relapsed into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The capture of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1453) drove the learned Greeks, <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a>, Theodorus Gaza, Constantine Lascaris, etc., into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. One of the most successful critics and editors of the classics was Lorenzo Valla (1407-57). He pointed out the defects in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and declared the <a href="../cathen/05118a.htm">Donation of Constantine</a> a fable. Despite his vehement attacks on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> brought him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Within a short period, the new studies claimed a still wider circle of votaries.



<p>The princely houses were generous in their support of the movement. Under the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>, Cosimo (1429-64) and Lorenzo the Magnificent (1469-92), Florence was pre-eminently the seat of the new learning. Its worthy statesman Mannetti, a man of great culture, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and purity, was an excellent Greek and Latin scholar, and a brilliant orator. The <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Ambrogio Traversari was also a profound scholar, especially versed in Greek; he possessed a magnificent collection of the Greek authors, and was one of the first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of modern times to learn Hebrew. Marsuppini (Carlo Aretino), renowned and beloved as professor and municipal chancellor, quoted from the Latin and Greek authors with such facility that his readiness was a source of wonder, even to an age sated with constant citation. Although in matters of religion Marsuppini was a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> sought to attract him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to translate Homer. Among his contemporaries, Leonardo Bruni, a pupil of <a href="../cathen/09614a.htm">Chrysoloras</a>, enjoyed great fame as a Greek scholar and a unique reputation for his political and literary activity. He was, moreover, the author of a history of Florence. Niccolo Niccoli was also a citizen of Florence; a patron of learning, he assisted and instructed young men, dispatched agents to collect ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and remains, and amassed a collection of eight hundred <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> (valued at six thousand gold gulden), which on his death were, through the mediation of Cosimo, donated to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Marco, to form a public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and are today one of the most valued possessions of the Laurentiana Library at Florence. The aforesaid Poggio, a versatile and influential writer, also resided for a long time at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, published a history of that city, and ridiculed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and nobility in his witty, libellous "Faceti&aelig;". He was distinguished for his extensive classical learning, translated some of the Greek authors (e.g. Lucian, Diodorus Siculus, Xenophon), appended scholarly and clever notes, collected inscriptions, busts, and medals, and wrote a valuable description of the ruins of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His success in seeking and unearthing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> has already been mentioned. <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Plethon</a>, also mentioned above, taught <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> philosophy at Florence.

<p><a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> was another panegyrist of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who now began to displace <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>; this, together with the influx of Greek scholars, led to the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> academy which included among its members all the more prominent citizens. Marsilio Ficino (d. 1499), a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in the full sense of the term, was one of its members, and by his works and letters exerted an extraordinary influence on his contemporaries. Along with his other literary labours he undertook the gigantic task of translating the writings of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> into elegant Latin, and accomplished it successfully. Cristoforo Landino, a pupil of Marsuppini, without sharing his religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, taught rhetoric and poetry at Florence and was also a statesman. His commentary on <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, in which he gives the most detailed explanation of the allegorical meaning of the great poet, is of lasting value. Under Lorenzo de' Medici, the most important man of letters in Florence was Angelo Poliziano (d. 1494), first the tutor of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> princes and subsequently a professor and a versatile writer. He was pre-eminently a philologist, and gave scholarly translations and commentaries on the classical authors, devoting special attention to Homer and Horace. He was, however, surpassed by the youthful and celebrated Count Pico della Mirandola (1462-94), who, to use Poliziano's phrase, "was eloquent and virtuous, a hero rather than a man". He noticed the relations between Hellenism and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, studied the Cabbala, combated <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and composed an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> work on the dignity of man. An active literary movement was also fostered by the Visconti and the Sforza in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where the vain and unprincipled Filelfo (1398-1481) resided; by the Gonzaga in <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, where the noble Vittorino da Feltre (d. 1446) conducted his excellent <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; by the kings of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; by the Este in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, who enjoyed the services of <a href="../cathen/07053a.htm">Guarino</a>, after Vittorino the most celebrated educationist of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> Humanism; by Duke Federigo of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and even by the profligate <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a> in <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>. Humanism was also favoured by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> (1447-55) sought by the erection of buildings and the collection of books to restore the glory of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The ablest intellects of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were attracted to the city; to <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and learning are indebted for the foundation of the Vatican Library, which in the number and value of its <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (particularly Greek) surpassed all others. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> encouraged, especially, translations from the Greek, and with important results, although no one won the prize of ten thousand gulden offered for a complete translation of Homer.

<p><a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> (1458-64) was a Humanist himself and had won fame as poet, orator, interpreter of antiquity, jurist, and statesman; after his election, however, he did not fulfil all the expectations of his earlier associates, although he showed himself in various ways a patron of literature and art. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84) re-established the Vatican Library, neglected by his predecessors, and appointed Platina librarian. "Here reigns an incredible freedom of thought", was Filelfo's description of the Roman Academy of Pomponio Leto (d. 1498), an institute which was the boldest champion of antiquity in the capital of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1513-21) Humanism and art enjoyed a second golden age. Of the illustrious circle of <em>literati</em> which surrounded him may be mentioned <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Pietro Bembo</a> (d. 1547) &#151; famous as a writer of prose and poetry, as a Latin and Italian author, as philologist and historian, and yet, in spite of his high <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worldling. To the same group belonged <a href="../cathen/13324a.htm">Jacopo Sadoleto</a>, also versed in the various branches of Latin and Italian culture. The chief merit of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> Humanism, as indeed of Humanism in general, was that it opened up the real sources of ancient culture and drew from these, as a subject of study for its own sake, the classic literature which till then had been used in a merely fragmentary way. Philological and scientific criticism was inaugurated, and historical research advanced. The uncouth Latin of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> and the monastic writers was replaced by classic elegance. More influential still, but not to good effect, were the religious and moral views of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and its <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> system suffered a serious shock. Moral relations, especially marriage, became the subject of ribald jest. In their private lives many Humanists were deficient in moral sense, while the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the upper classes degenerated into a pitiable excess of unrestrained <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a>. A political expression of the humanistic spirit is "The Prince" (Il Principe) of <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Niccolo Machiavelli</a> (d. 1527), the gospel of brute force, of contempt for all morality, and of cynical selfishness.

<p>The pillaging of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1527 gave the death-blow to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> Humanism, the serious political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> complications that ensued prevented its recovery. "Barbarian <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>" had long since become its heir, but here Humanism never penetrated so deeply. The religious and moral earnestness of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> kept them from going too far in their devotion to antiquity, beauty, and the pleasures of sense, and gave the humanistic movement in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> a practical and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> character. The real directors of the German movement were upright scholars and professors. Only Celtes and a few others are reminiscent of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> Humanism. School and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> reform was the chief aim and the chief service of German Humanism. Although German interest in ancient literature began under Charles IV (1347-78), the spread of Humanism in German countries dates from the fifteenth century. &AElig;neas Sylvius Piccolomini, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, was the apostle of the new movement at the court of Frederick III (1440-93). The renowned scholar <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a> (d. 1464) was versed in the classics, while his friend Georg Peuerbach studied in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and subsequently lectured on the ancient poets at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Johann M&uuml;ller of K&ouml;nigsberg (Regiomontanus), a pupil of Peuerbach's, was familiar with Greek, but was chiefly renowned as an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> and mathematician. Though <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> could not boast of as many powerful patrons of learning as <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the new movement did not lack supporters. The Emperor Maximilian I, Elector Philip of the Palatinate, and his chancellor, Johann von Dalberg (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms), Duke Eberhard of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, Elector Frederick the Wise, Duke George of Saxony, Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg, and Archbishop Albrecht of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> were all supporters of Humanism.

<p>Among the citizens, too, the movement met with favour and encouragement. In <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> it was supported by the above-mentioned Regiomontanus, the historians, <a href="../cathen/13525a.htm">Hartmann Schedel</a> and Sigmund Meisterlein, and also by <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Willibald Pirkheimer</a> (1470-1528), who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was an indefatigable worker in the antiquarian and historical field. His sister, Charitas, the gentle <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, united with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> a cultivated <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Konrad <a href="../cathen/11784d.htm">Peutinger</a> (1465-1547), town clerk of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, devoted his leisure to the service of the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, by collecting inscriptions and ancient remains and publishing, or having published by others, the sources of German history. The map of Ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, named after him "Tabula Peutingeriana", was bequeathed to him by its discoverer, Conrad Celtes, but was not published until after his death. Strasburg was the earliest German stronghold of humanistic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Jacob Wimpheling (d. 1528), a champion of German sentiment and nationality, and Sebastian Brant were the chief representatives of the movement, and attained a wide reputation owing to their quarrel with <a href="../cathen/10645a.htm">Murner</a>, who had published a paper in opposition to <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling's</a> "Germania", and owing to the controversy concerning the Immaculate Conception. As in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> so in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> sprang up, such as the "Donaugesellschaft" (Danubiana) in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> &#151; the most prominent member of which, Johann Spiessheimer (Cuspinian, 1473-1529), distinguished himself as an editor and an historian &#151; and the "Rheinische Gesellschaft" (Rhenana), under the above-mentioned Johann von Dalberg. Closely associated with the latter was <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Abbot Johannes Trithemius</a> (1462-1516), a man of universal attainments. The life of these two chief <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> was Conrad Celtes, the fearless and unwearying apostle and itinerant preacher of Humanism, a man of the most varied talents &#151; a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, mathematician, historian, publisher of classical and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writings, and a clever Latin poet, who celebrated in ardent verse his ever-changing lady-loves and led a life of worldly indulgence.

<p>Into the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, too, the representatives of the "languages and belles-lettres" soon found their way. In Basle, which, in 1474, had appointed a professor of the liberal arts and poetry, the movement was represented chiefly by <a href="../cathen/06577a.htm">Heinrich Glareanus</a> (1488-1563), celebrated as geographer and musician. The best known Humanist of T&uuml;bingen was the poet Heinrich Bebel (1472-1518), an ardent patriot and an enthusiastic admirer of style and eloquence. His most widely-known work is the obscene "Faceti&aelig;". Agricola (d. 1485), in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> a perfect stylist and Latinist, taught at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>. The inaugurator of Humanism in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> was the prolific author, Dietrich Gresemund (1477-1512). The movement secured official recognition at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1502 under Elector Berthold, and found in Joannes Rhagius &AElig;sticampianus its most influential supporter. In the itinerant poet Peter Luder, Erfurt had in 1460 one of the earliest representatives of Humanism, and in Jodokus Trutfetter (1460-1519), the teacher of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, a diligent writer and conscientious professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The real guide of the youth of Erfurt was, however, Konrad Mutianus Rufus (1471-1526), a canon at Gotha, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for teaching coupled with a pugnacious temperament, a delight in books but not in their making, religious latitudinarianism, and enthusiasm for the antique were his chief characteristics. The satirist <a href="../cathen/04539c.htm">Crotus Rubianus Euricius Cordus</a>, the witty epigrammatist, and the elegant poet and merry companion, Eobanus Hessus, belonged also to the Erfurt circle.

<p>In Leipzig also, the first traces of humanistic activity date back to the middle of the fifteenth century. In 1503, when the <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> Hermann von dem Busche settled in the city, Humanism had there a notable representation. From 1507 to 1511 &AElig;sticampianus also laboured in <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, but in the former year von dem Busche removed to Cologne. From the beginning (1502) <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> was under humanistic influence. Many were the collisions between the champions of the old philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and "the poets", who adopted a somewhat arrogant attitude. About 1520 all the German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> had been modernized in the humanistic sense; attendance at the lectures on poetry and oratory was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, Greek chairs were founded, and the scholastic commentaries on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> were replaced by new translations. The most influential of the humanistic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were, that of Schlettstadt under the <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> Ludwig Dringenberg (d. 1477), the teacher of <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling</a>, that of Deventer under Alexander Hegius (1433-98), the teacher of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> of Rotterdam, Hermann von dem Busche, and Murmellius, and that of M&uuml;nster, which underwent humanistic reformation in 1500 under the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Rudolf von Langen (1438-1519), and which under the co-rector, Joannes Murmellius (1480-1517), the author of numerous and widely-adopted textbooks, attracted pupils from such distant parts as <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> and Silesia. Good academic institutions also existed in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, Basle, etc.

<p>The humanistic movement reached its zenith during the first two decades of the sixteenth century in Reuchlin, <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, and Hutten. Johann Reuchlin (1455-1522), the "phoenix of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>", was skilled in all the branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that were then cultivated. Primarily a jurist, an expert in Greek, a first-rate authority on Roman authors, an historian, and a poet, he nevertheless attained his chief renown through his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and Hebrew works &#151; especially through his "Rudimenta Hebraica" (grammar and lexicon) &#151; in the composition of which he secured the assistance of Jewish scholars. His model was Pico della Mirandola, the "wise count, the most learned of our age". He studied the esoteric <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Cabbala, but lost himself in the maze of its abstruse problems, and, after having become, in academic retirement, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and glory of his nation, was suddenly forced by a peculiar incident into <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a>. This occurrence has been not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> termed the culminating point of Humanism. Johann Pfefferkorn, a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, had declared the Talmud a deliberate insult to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and had procured from the emperor a mandate suppressing Hebrew works. Asked for his opinion, Reuchlin on scientific and legal grounds expressed his personal disapprobation of this action. Enraged at this opposition, Pfefferkorn, in his "Handspiegel", attacked Reuchlin, in reply to which the latter composed the "Augenspiegel". The <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Cologne, particularly Hochstraten, declared against Reuchlin, who then appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Speier, entrusted with the settlement of the strife, declared himself in favour of Reuchlin. Hochstraten, however, now proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; in 1516 a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> mandate postponing the case was issued, but finally in 1520, under the pressure of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran movement</a>, Reuchlin was condemned to preserve silence on the matter in future and to pay full costs.

<p>But more important than the lawsuit was the literary <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> that accompanied it. This strife was a prelude to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. All <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was divided into two camps. The Reuchlinists, the "fosterers of the arts and of the study of humanity", the "bright, renowned men" (clari viri), whose approving letters (Epistol&aelig; clarorum virorum) Reuchlin had published in 1514, predominated in numbers and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; the Cologne party, styled by their opponents "the obscurantists" (viri obscuri), were more intent on defence than attack. The most important document of this literary feud is the classical satire of the Humanists, "The Letters of the Obscurantists" (Epistol&aelig; obscurorum virorum, 1515-17), of which the first part was composed by <a href="../cathen/04539c.htm">Crotus Rubianus</a>, the second substantially by Hutten. Ostensibly these letters were written by various partisans of the Cologne University to Ortwin Gratius, their poet and master, and were couched in barbarous Latin. They purport to describe the life and doings of the obscurantists, their opinions and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>, their debaucheries and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> affairs. The lack of culture, the obsolete methods of instruction and study, the perverse expenditure of ingenuity, the pedantry of the obscurantists, are mercilessly ridiculed. Although the pamphlet was dictated by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and was full of reckless exaggeration, an inimitable originality and power of caricature secured its success. The Humanists regarded the dispute as decided, and sang the "Triumph of Reuchlin". The latter, however, ever remained a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> supporter of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Desiderius Erasmus</a> of Rotterdam (1467-1536) was termed the "second eye of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>". Vivacious, acute, and witty, he was the leader and literary <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> of the century, while his name, according to the testimony of a contemporary, had passed into proverb: "Whatever is ingenious, scholarly, and wisely written, is termed erasmic, that is, unerring and perfect." His extraordinarily fruitful and versatile literary activity as profound Latinist and incomparable revivalist of Greek, as critic and commentator, as educator, satirist, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and Biblical <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, it is impossible to dwell upon here (see <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">ERASMUS</a>, <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">DESIDERIUS</a>). Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523), a Franconian <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, and enthusiastic champion of the liberal <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, was still better known as politician and agitator. The strengthening of the emperor's power and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were the chief items of his political programme, which he preached first in Latin and subsequently in German dialogues, poems, and pamphlets. The jurists and the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a>, the immorality and illiteracy of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the fatuity of unpractical pedantry, were mercilessly scourged by him, his aim being of course to make himself conspicuous. Finally, he enlisted in the service of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and celebrated him in his last writings as a "hero of the Word", a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, though <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> always maintained towards him an attitude of reserve. Hutten's death may be regarded as the end of German Humanism properly speaking. A still more serious movement, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, took its place. The majority of the Humanists set themselves in opposition to the new movement, though it cannot be denied that they, especially the younger generation under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> and Mutianus Rufus, had in many ways paved the way for it.

<p>The progress of Humanism in other lands may be reviewed more briefly. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> exerted a powerful influence. By the end of the fourteenth century the students of this institution were already conversant with the ancient authors. <a href="../cathen/04011b.htm">Nicolas de Cl&eacute;manges</a> (1360-1434) lectured on Ciceronian rhetoric, but the earliest real Humanist in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was Jean de Montreuil (d. 1418). In 1455 Gregorio of <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Citt&agrave; di Castello</a>, who had resided in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, was installed in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to lecture on Greek and rhetoric. Subsequently, there came from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> scholars and poets &#151; e.g. <a href="../cathen/09010c.htm">Andreas Joannes Lascaris</a>, <a href="../cathen/13506a.htm">Julius C&aelig;sar Scaliger</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01273b.htm">Andreas Alciati</a> &#151; who made <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the docile daughter of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Among the leading scholars in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> may be mentioned Bud&eacute; (Bud&aelig;us), the first Hellenist of his age (1467-1540), the accomplished printers Robert (1503-59) and Henri (1528-98) Estienne (Stephanus), to whom we are indebted for the "Thesaurus lingu&aelig; Latin&aelig;" and the "Thesaurus lingu&aelig; Gr&aelig;c&aelig;"; Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540-1609), famed for his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of epigraphy, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>, and especially of <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>; the philologist Isaac Casaubon (1559-1614), well known for his excellent edition of the classics, and Petrus Ramus (1515-72), a profound student of Greek and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> philosophy.

<p>Classical learning was naturalized in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> through Queen Isabella (1474-1504). The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system was reorganized, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> entered on a new era of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> prosperity. Of Spanish scholars Juan Luis Vives (1492-1540) enjoyed a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> reputation. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Humanism was received with less favour. Poggio, indeed, passed some time in that country, and young Englishmen, like William Grey, a pupil of <a href="../cathen/07053a.htm">Guarino's</a>, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> and privy councillor in 1454, sought instruction in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But the troubled conditions of English life in the fifteenth century did not favour the new movement. In the spread of classical learning William Caxton (1421-91), the first English printer, played an important part. The learned, refined, charitable, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> chancellor <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Thomas More</a> (1478-1535) was in a way an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> counterpart of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, with whom he was on terms of closest intimacy. Of special importance was the foundation of such excellent <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as Eton in 1440, and St. Paul's (London) in 1508. The founder of the latter was the accomplished Dean John Colet (1466-1519); the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was William Lilly (1468-1523), who had studied Greek in the Island of Rhodes, and Latin in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was the pioneer of Greek <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. During the sojourn of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> at Oxford (1497-9) he found kindred hellenistic spirits in William Grocyn and Thomas Linacre, both of whom had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. From 1510 to 1513 <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> taught Greek at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>.
