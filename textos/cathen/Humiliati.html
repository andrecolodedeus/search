<h1>Humiliati</h1>  

<p>I. A penitential order dating back, according to some authorities, to the beginning of the eleventh, but more probably to the beginning of the twelfth century, to the reign of <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a>, who, after quelling a rebellion in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, led the principal nobles of the cities implicated back to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as captives. Converted from the vanities of the world, these assumed a penitential garb of grey and gave themselves up to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, whereupon the emperor, after receiving their pledges of future loyalty, permitted their return to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. At this time they were often called Barettini, from the shape of their head-dress. Their acquaintance with the German woollen manufactures enabled them to introduce improved methods into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, thus giving a great impetus to the industry, supplying the poor with employment and distributing their gains among those in want. On the advice of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, in 1134, many of them, with the consent of their wives, withdrew from the world, establishing their first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. They exchanged their ashen habit for one of white. Some years later, on the advice of St. John Meda of Oldrado (d. 1159), they embraced the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, adapted by St. John to their needs; they received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> from <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> about 1200, and from many succeeding pontiffs The order grew rapidly, gave many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and blessed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, assisted in combating the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>, formed trades associations among the people, and played an important part in the civic life of every community in which they were established. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, however, owing to the accumulation of temporal goods and the restriction of the number of members admitted (for at one time there were only about 170 in the 94 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>), grave abuses crept in, which <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> to reform. His fearless efforts roused such opposition among a minority that a conspiracy was formed and a murderous assault made on him by one of the Humiliati, a certain Girolamo Donati, called Farina, which, though it was unsuccessful, was responsible for the execution of the chief conspirators and the suppression of the order by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 8 Feb., 1571. The houses and possessions were bestowed on other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, including the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, or applied to charity.

<p>II. The wives of the first Humiliati, who belonged to some of the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, also formed a community under Clara Blassoni, and were joined by so many others that it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to open a second <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, the members of which devoted themselves to the care of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in a neighbouring <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, whence they were also known as <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Observance. The number of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> increased rapidly, but the suppression of the male branch of the order, which had administered their temporal affairs, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a heavy blow, involving in many cases the closing of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, though the congegation itself was not affected by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of suppression. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> observed the canonical Hours, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> rigorously and taking the discipline at stated times. Some retained the ancient <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the order, when other houses adopted the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>. The habit consists of a robe and <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> of white over a tunic of ashen grey, the veils being usually white, though in some houses black. The lay sisters, who retain the name of Barettine, wear grey. There are still in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> five independent houses of Humiliati.
