<h1>Humphrey Berisford</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a> (c. 1588) of whom the only extant account occurs in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> marked "F", compiled during the seventeenth century by Father Christopher Grene. This <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which is now at the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has been partly printed in <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley's</a> "Records" (III). Of Humphrey Berisford it states that he was a gentleman of the county of Derby, whose father, an esquire, was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The account continues: "He studied at Douay about two years. Returning from thence, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> employed him about his suit in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and having once a suit against one, who fearing to be cast by his means, accused him before the judge for a <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a>. When the cause should have been heard the judge examined him. He constantly professed his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Then the judge offered both favour to his cause and liberty if he would but only say he would go to their church; which he utterly refused. Therefore he was committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> where he remained seven [blank in original] then died a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>". Gillow conjectures that the missing word was years and states that he died in Derby Gaol about 1588. To this account nothing can with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> be added. The "Douay Diaries" mention one "Beresfordus" among other "sons of men of position" (<em>nobilium filii</em>) as leaving the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in November, 1576. On 31 May, 1577, he is spoken of as returning from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and is then alluded to as <em>clarus adolescens</em>. But this young man cannot be certainly identified with Humphrey Berisford as there were at this time other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the same name, three of whom, James, Oswald, and Frederick Beresford, were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in the Poultry Counter in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, in this very year.
