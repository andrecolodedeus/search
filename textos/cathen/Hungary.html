<h1>Hungary</h1>  

<h2>Geography and material conditions</h2>

<p>The Kingdom of Hungary, or "Realm of the Crown of St. Stephen", situated between 14&#186; 25' and 26&#186; 25' E. longitude, and between 44&#186; 10' and 49&#186; 35' N. latitude, includes, besides Hungary Proper and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and a territory known as the Military Frontier. The total area is 125,430 square miles, of which 16,423 belong to the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Of a population of 19,254,559 (census of 1900) 51.5 per cent were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The population of the capital, Budapest, situated on both sides of the Danube, is about 800,000.

<p>The southern boundary of the kingdom is the River Save, which separates it from <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a> and Servia as far east as the Rumanian frontier, from which point the artificial boundary of <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> continues along the south, turning north-east, and then north. On the north lies Galicia; on the north-west, Moravia; on the west Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, and Carniola. Some 43,000 square miles are occupied by the Great and the Little Hungarian Alf&ouml;ld, two great plains enclosed by the Alps and the Carpathians. The country is drained by the Danube and its tributaries the Save and Drave, on the right bank, and, on the left, the Theiss, which in its turn receives the waters of the Maros. The chief industry is agriculture (including forestry), which supports nearly 13,000,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The chief crops are wheat and maize. Manufacturing industries employ 12.8 per cent of the wage-earning population. Mining (lignite, pig iron, coal, and gold being the chief items) in 1906 employed 72,290 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and produced a revenue of 116,000,000 Kronen ($23,200,000). Grazing also contributes largely to the national wealth.
<h2>History</h2>
<h3 id="A">From early times to the Battle of Moh&aacute;cs (1526)</h3>

<p>Even in the earliest ages the territory of the present Kingdom of Hungary was the abode of various races of men. The remains from prehistoric times show that the country was inhabited when the present Hungarian lowlands were covered by the ocean. Half a century before Christ the Thracians occupied Hungary east of the Danube, while Hungary west of the Danube was the home of Celtic and Illyrian tribes. At the opening of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> the sway of the Romans extended as far as the Danube; Pannonia formed part of the Roman Empire for 400 years, and Dacia for about 150 years. After <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> fell, Hungary, like the other provinces, was affected by the migrations. First came the Huns who built up under <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">King Attila</a>, called "the Scourge of God", the powerful Hunnish Empire. After the empire of the Huns went to pieces German tribes ruled in Hungary for about 100 years, and they were followed by the Avars. During the supremacy of the Avars, a period of over two hundred years, began the migration of the Slavonic tribes. Moravians, Bulgars, Croato-Serbians, and Poles all sought to overthrow the Avars, but their power was not broken until <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> appeared. The decline of the kingdom of the East <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, after the death of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, was favourable to the development of a great Slavonic power, and Swatopluk, ruler of Great <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, thought to establish a permanent Moravian kingdom, but the appearance of the Magyars put an end to these schemes.

<p>There are two opposing theories as to the origin of the Magyars, or native Hungarians. Arminius V&aacute;mb&eacute;ry and his supporters hold to a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> origin of the Magyars, while P&aacute;l Hunfalvy and his followers place them in the Finno-Ugrian division of languages of a Ural-Altaic stem and look for the original home of the race in the region of the Ural mountains, or the district between the rivers Obi, Irtysh, Kama, and Volga. The presence of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> words in the language is explained by the theory that, after leaving their former home, the Hungarians dwelt for some time near <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> tribes, who were undoubtedly on a higher level of civilization, and from whom these words were borrowed. About the middle of the ninth century, when the Byzantine writers first speak of the Hungarians, calling them "Turci", the Hungarians were in Lebedia, in the territory on the right bank of the Don. From this point they carried on their marauding excursions into the district of the Lower Danube and on these expeditions they sometimes advanced into <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Being exposed to attack by the Bisseni, the Hungarians left Lebedia, some returning to the district on the further side of the Volga, while others went towards the west and settled near the Danube, between the Dniester, Sereth Pruth, and Bug Rivers. The Byzantine writers called this region Atelkuzu (Hungarian, Etelk&ouml;z). While in this neighbourhood the Hungarians undertook an expedition under Arp&aacute;d in 893 or 894 against Simeon, ruler of the Bulgars. The expedition was successful, but Simeon formed an alliance with the Bisseni, and a fierce attack was made on the Hungarians in which their land was devastated. The Hungarians, therefore, withdrew from this region, went westward, and reached the country where they now live. The date of their entry into Hungary is not certain, apparently it was 895 or 896; neither is the point from which they came positively ascertained. It is not improbable that they entered Hungary from three directions and arrived at different periods. The chronicle of the "anonymous notary of King B&eacute;la" (<em>Anonymus Bel&oelig; regis notarius</em>) has preserved the history of the first occupation of the country, but modern historical investigation shows that little credence can be given the narrative.

<p>The Magyars settled in the neighbourhood of the Danube, and especially in the district on the farther side, as best suited to their occupation, that of cattle-raising. In this region were founded their first towns, the most important of the country, namely, <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, Sz&eacute;kes-Feh&eacute;rvar, and Buda. At about the same time, under their leader Arp&aacute;d (died 907), they began once more their marauding expeditions and attacked the countries west of them; these forays, which went as far as <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, were continued under Zolt&aacute;n (907-47), and Taksony (947-72), and did not cease until the land was converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the reign of G&eacute;za. When the Hungarians took possession of the country where they now live, they found a strong Slavonic <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> already in existence in the western part, in Pannonia, where the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> had been spread partly by German and partly by <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Methodius, the author of the Slavonic liturgy, endeavoured to introduce the use of the new liturgy here also, but with his death (855) these efforts came to an end. Consequently, the Magyars received their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> partly from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population already existing in the country, and partly from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> whom they captured in their marauding expeditions. These forays into the territories farther to the west, which lasted into the tenth century, were a great obstacle to the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and at the same time the national <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the Hungarians prevented the acceptance of the religion of the conquered population. Their defeats near Merseburg, in 933, and on the Lech, in 955, put an end to these western expeditions and made the Hungarians more favourable to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.



<p>The opinion that the first efforts for the conversion of the Hungarians were made from Constantinople, because the Magyar commanders Bulcsu and Gyula accepted the Greek <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at Constantinople, rests, as has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, on the inventions of Byzantine chroniclers. The conversion of the land to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was effected, in reality, from the west, and the change began in the ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Duke G&eacute;za, who from 970 had been the sole ruler of Hungary, perceived the danger which threatened Hungary, surrounded as it was by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, if it continued <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. He saw that, if Hungary persisted in shutting out <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, it would sooner or later be the prey of the neighbouring peoples. His marriage with Adelaide, sister of the Polish Duke Miezco (Mieczyslaw), brought him closer to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> is to be attributed to Adelaide's influence. It was through Adelaide's efforts that <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, came to Hungary and, in 985, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> G&eacute;za and his son Vaik; the latter took the name of Stephen in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. A large number of the most prominent of G&eacute;za's retainers and of his people embraced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> at the same time. Evil results arose, however, from the fact that Adalbert did not at once establish an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization for Hungary. Moreover, a large proportion of the newly converted adopted the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only in externals and retained their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> customs, offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the old gods. Yet, notwithstanding all this, the new religion continued to spread among the people.

<p>The actual conversion of the country and its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization was the work of St. Stephen, son of Duke G&eacute;za, who succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in 997. His marriage with Gisela, sister of Duke Henry of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, gave a powerful impulse to the spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. From <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> came large numbers of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nobles, and <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, who settled in Hungary and aided Stephen in converting the country to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Many obstacles were encountered, and the new religion was spread by the sword. The advance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was regarded as endangering national interests, and the influx of strangers, together with the favour shown these new settlers by the ruler, seemed to set aside the national influences in the government. Consequently, soon after the accession of Stephen, a revolt led by Kopp&aacute;n broke out, but it was quickly suppressed, with the aid of the foreign <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>; in this way the reputation both of Stephen and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was established in the regions on the farther side of the Danube. To show his gratitude for this victory Stephen built the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Pannonhalma (Martinsberg). Stephen's victory was also followed by the coming of large numbers of German, French, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to Hungary, which greatly aided the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>Stephen now undertook the task of providing the land with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. To secure the independence both of the country and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in his dominions, he petitioned Pope Sylvester II, through Abbot Astricus, for the royal dignity and the confirmation of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts and ordinances; he also placed his dominion under the protectorate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Sylvester acceded to Stephen's request, sent him a royal crown, and confirmed his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations. According to tradition, Stephen also received the title of Apostolic King and Apostolic Legate, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> cross carried before him, and other privileges, but modern investigation has shown that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Pope Sylvester bestowing these honours is a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of the seventeenth century. After the return of Abbot Astricus, Stephen was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of Hungary with the crown sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, 17 August, 1001. In settling the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he placed at its head the <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Archdiocese of Gran</a>, giving it as suffragans, Gy&ouml;r (Raab), <a href="../cathen/15392a.htm">Veszpr&eacute;m</a>, P&eacute;cs (F&uuml;nfkirchen), V&aacute;cz (Waitzen), and Eger. About 1010 he founded a second archdiocese, that of Kalocsa, which had as suffragans the Dioceses of Bihar, <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, and Marosv&aacute;r (later Csan&aacute;d) which was founded in 1038. In this way the land was divided into ten <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Archdiocese of Gran</a> being the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> settled in Hungary during this reign, and Stephen founded the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Pannonhalma (Martinsberg), Zobor, P&eacute;csv&aacute;rad, Zalav&aacute;r, and Bakonyb&eacute;l; he also founded numerous other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for Greek <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> near Veszpr&eacute;m.

<p>In order to provide for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Stephen issued edicts concerning church <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that each tenth township should build a church and provide the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with suitable land and servants for his support. The king was to supply the churches with all the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> equipment, while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> selected the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and provided the books needed. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of King Stephen also contain ordinances regarding attendance at Mass, observance of the church <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, etc. With the aid of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> Stephen brought over almost all of his people to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, although during this reign measures had often to be taken against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> movements among the population &mdash; as against his uncle Michael (1003), against the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> prince Kean, and (1025) against Ajton. These revolts, although political in character, were also aimed more or less at the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Stephen was able to suppress these insurrections, and could, therefore, hope that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would meet with no further antagonism. The confusion and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> over the succession, which followed the death of Stephen, and the stormy reigns of Kings Peter and Aba Sam&uuml; (1038-46) soon brought about a decline of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. A part of the nation sank back into the old <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, and in 1046 there was a revolt against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion which led to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Bishop Gerhard, who was thrown by the insurgents from the Blocksberg at Buda into the river. The new king, Andrew I (1047-60), either could not or would not act energetically at first, and it was not until after his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> that he took strong measures against those who had fallen away from the Faith. After his death a small part of the population that was still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> broke out into revolt, but this rebellion was quickly suppressed by King B&eacute;la I (1060-63). The internal disorders during the reigns of King Solomon (1064-74) and King G&eacute;za I (1074-77) did great damage to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> decayed, and many abuses crept into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>During the reigns of <a href="../cathen/08737a.htm">St. Ladislaus</a> (1077-95) and Koloman (1095-1114) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was reformed and many ordinances were passed against the prevailing abuses. In particular the synod of Szabolcs (1092) took decided measures against the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as a special act of grace, were permitted to exercise <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, but a new marriage was regarded as <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> and such unions were to be dissolved. The synod also passed ordinances concerning the indissolubility of marriage and the observance of church festivals and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. Other decisions were directed against the still existing <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> manners and customs. After the conquest of <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a> Ladislaus founded the <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Diocese of Z&aacute;gr&aacute;b (Agram)</a>. He transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the Archdiocese of Kalocsa to B&aacute;cs, and that of the Diocese of Bihar, founded by St. Stephen, to Grosswardein (Nagy-V&aacute;rad). He founded new churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and took measures for the conversion of the Bisseni and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (<a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Ishmaelites</a>) who had settled in Hungary. Ladislaus successfully resisted the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Cumans. During the reign of Koloman the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was largely under the influence of the royal authority. Koloman claimed the investiture of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for himself, made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to perform military service, etc. At a later date, at the synod of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a>, Koloman yielded the right of granting investiture and agreed that the chapters should have freedom in the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The reforms of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> were also adopted in Hungary. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were withdrawn from secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, marriage was regarded as valid only when entered into before a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> was enforced, and a number of ordinances beneficial to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> were passed.

<p>The chief feature of the reigns of Koloman's successors <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> (1114-31), B&eacute;la II (1131-41), G&eacute;za II (1141-61), and Stephen III (1161-73), was the struggle of Hungary with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> for national independence. These <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, however, did not check the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. One of the most important events of this period was the synod at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> (1169). It enacted that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could not be transferred without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, took the administration of vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> out of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and obtained a promise from the king that the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> should only be taken in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and then not without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was in this period that the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, and Knights of St. John settled in Hungary; in the thirteenth century these orders were followed by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. About 1150 Saxon colonists, of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, settled in upper Hungary and in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> grew rapidly in Hungary during the reign of B&eacute;la III (1173-96) as the king granted the order the same privileges as it enjoyed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Fresh disorders sprang up in Hungary after the death of King B&eacute;la III. King Emeric (1196-1204) was engaged in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with his brother Andrew, who coveted the throne, until Emeric's death put an end to the fratricidal struggle.

<p>Andrew II (1205-35), who was now king, was soon involved in a struggle with the oligarchy. At his accession he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to swear to protect the liberties of the land and the independence of the royal dignity. When he failed to observe these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, the nobles forced him to issue the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (1222), the Magna Charta of Hungary. This instrument confirmed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the nobles and gave them the privilege to take up arms against the king when he failed to observe the conditions here agreed upon, but it did not fulfil the hopes it had raised; its provisions were not carried out, and the disorders continued. Neither did Andrew, who in 1217 took part in an unsuccessful <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to the Holy Land, observe the agreement confirming the liberty of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> saw itself endangered by the continually growing influence exerted over the king by the Ishmaelites and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. After all warnings to the king had failed, Archbishop Robert of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> placed Hungary under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> (1232), in order to force the king to put an end to the prevailing abuses and to guard the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The king promised the correction of the abuses and, especially, to guard the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but he was too weak a man for energetic action. His son B&eacute;la IV (1235-70) endeavoured to restore order, above all he tried to carry out the provisions of the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, but his efforts were interfered with by an invasion of the Tatars, which nearly ruined the country. After the battle near Muhi (1241), they devastated the entire land; thousands of the inhabitants were massacred, hundreds of churches were plundered and razed to the ground, and six of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were nearly destroyed. Consequently, when the Tatars left the country, King B&eacute;la was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take up the reorganization both of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular affairs. The damage suffered was repaired through the self-sacrifice of the royal family and the people; new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches were built, those that had been destroyed were restored, and colonists were brought in to repair the losses in population. These colonists were partly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Germans and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, and partly <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Cumans. Those of the Cumans who lived apart from the others were soon converted, but the majority held to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and did not become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> until the middle of the fourteenth century.

<p>The last years of the reign of B&eacute;la IV were disturbed by a quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> concerning the appointment to the vacant <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Diocese of Z&aacute;gr&aacute;b (Agram)</a>, and by the revolt of his son Stephen, who succeeded him. Stephen V reigned only two years (1270-72); he was followed by his son Ladislaus IV (1272-90) who, when he came to the throne, was still a minor. In this reign efforts were made to restore church discipline that had fallen into decay during the disorders of the previous years. For this decline of church discipline and of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Cumans were largely responsible; they wandered about the land plundering and damaging the churches. The king was on good terms with them and maintained relations with Cumanian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; his example was followed by others. It is not surprising that under the circumstances disorders broke out once more in Hungary, and that the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered. Philip, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, came to Hungary in 1279 as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> and held a great synod at Buda (Ofen), where various decisions were reached concerning the preservation of the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the restoration of canon law, but the synod was forcibly dissolved by the king, and its members driven away. The appeals made by the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to the king were in vain; Ladislaus promised, indeed, to act differently, and to reform the disordered political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions, but he failed to keep his word. After the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Ladislaus, the last of the Arp&aacute;d dynasty, Andrew III, grandson of Andrew II, became king. During his reign of ten years (1290-1301) he was engaged in a constant struggle with foreign claimants to the throne, and could give no care to the internal and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions of the country. Rudolf of Hapsburg endeavoured to wrest Hungary from Andrew for his son Albrecht, and the grandson of Stephen V, Charles Martell of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, also claimed it. After the death of the latter, who had the support of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, his son, Charles Robert, maintained the father's claims, and from 1295 assumed the title of King of Hungary.

<p>After the death of Andrew III a series of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> broke out over the succession. A part of the people and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> held to King Wenceslaus, another to Otto, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and still another to Charles Robert. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> strongly espoused the cause of Charles Robert and sent Cardinal <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> to Hungary. Notwithstanding these efforts in his favour, it was not until 1309 that Charles Robert (1309-42) was able to secure the throne of Hungary for himself. There now began for the country a long period of consolidation. The new king regulated the internal administration, brought the state finances into good order, imposing for this purpose in 1323 a land tax, reorganized the army, and sought to increase his dynastic power by forming connexions with foreign countries. In church affairs he encroached largely on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; he filled the vacant sees and the church offices without regard to the electoral <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters. He claimed the revenues of vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> for himself, confiscated the incomes of other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, granted large numbers of expectancies, and forced those appointed to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> to pay a larger or smaller sum before taking office. In 1338 a part of the Hungarian episcopate sent a memorial to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, in which, with some exaggeration, they presented an account of the encroachments of the king. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> notified the king of the memorial, an act which created no ill-feeling between the two; the Holy Father contented himself with admonishing the king in a paternal manner to remove the abuses and to avoid infringing on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>During the reign of Louis I, the Great (1342-82), the son of Charles Robert, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> reached the height of prosperity in Hungary. Numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and other religious foundations came into existence in this reign; above all, the Hermits of St. Paul enjoyed the king's special favour. In 1381 Louis obtained from the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11590b.htm">St. Paul the Hermit</a>, which were taken with great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> pomp to the Pauline <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Buda. Among his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> acts must be counted the building of the church at the place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, Gross-Mariazell in <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08737a.htm">St. Ladislaus</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. Splendid churches were also built in Hungary, as at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, Eger, and Grosswardein (Nagy-V&aacute;rad). In filling <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices the king was careful that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> should receive well-trained and competent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In order to promote learning he founded the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at P&eacute;cs (F&uuml;nfkirchen). Louis also sought to bring about the conversion of the Slavonic peoples living to the south of Hungary, who held to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, the Serbs, Wallachians, and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. His attempts to convert them led to repeated conflicts with these races. In this reign began the struggle with the growing power of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, against whose assaults Hungary now became the bulwark of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Internal disorders broke out again in the reign of Maria (1382-95), the daughter of Louis, in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered greatly in the southern part of the kingdom, especially in <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>. In Hungary proper the queen sought to further the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The most important measures passed at a synod at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> were decisions regarding the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Maria built several churches of the Perpetual Adoration. From 1387 her rule was merely nominal, her husband Sigismund being the real ruler. After Maria's death he became her successor.

<p>In one of the first years (1397) of Sigismund's reign (1395-1436), the decrees of the Diet of 1387 were renewed. These declared that no <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> could be bestowed on a foreign ecclesiastic. Sigismund, however, paid little attention to this regulation. Immediately on entering upon his reign Sigismund came into conflict with the Hungarian oligarchy. This led to open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and even, for a time, to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the king. In 1403, King Ladislaus of Naples appeared as rival king; nevertheless, Sigismund was able to maintain himself on the throne. His reign was coincident with a large part of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Western Schism</a>, and the two great reforming Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle were held while he was on the throne. In the Great Schism, Hungary adhered to the obedience (or party) of the Roman claimant to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Louis I, the Great, had supported <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, and his successors, Maria and Sigismund, also sided with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>. Sigismund, indeed, in 1403 renounced <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, because this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supported the rival King Ladislaus, yet he did not recognize <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. At a later date he recognized <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> and subsequently supported the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>. In 1404 the Diet declared that in future <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> in Hungary could only be bestowed by the king, consequently the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> both of spiritual and secular patrons were annulled, and the <em>jus placeti</em> introduced, according to which <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> and commands could only be accepted and proclaimed in Hungary after they had received the royal approval. Supported by these enactments Sigismund at once asserted his right to appoint <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Naturally, the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> did not recognize this claim and refused to give the investiture to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen by Sigismund. Upon this Sigismund, in 1410, appealed to <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, from whom he requested the recognition of this right. <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John</a> did not accede to this request, although he granted investiture to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed by the king and thus tacitly recognized the royal right of filling <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, a right which, as a matter of fact, the king continued to exercise.

<p>After his election as King of the Romans, Sigismund endeavoured to bring the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> to an end. The <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> was restored by the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and the concordat made with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was also authoritative for Hungary. While the council was in session, after the deposition of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, Sigismund obtained for himself and his successors the right of naming the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This right was, indeed, not put into documentary form, but Stephen Werb&ouml;czi, in his collection of the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> "Opus Tripartitum juris consuetudinarii regni Hungari&aelig;", asserted that this right was conceded to the King of Hungary at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and Cardinal Peter P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny also referred to it at a later date. The council further decided that in Hungary <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases should be tried in the country itself, and not brought before the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, that only appeals could be taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the council had closed Sigismund claimed to the fullest extent the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which had been conceded to him by the council. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> having seized <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Spalato</a> and <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a>, with their suffragans, were lost to Hungary. This is the reason why in Hungarian official documents for many years these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were given as vacant. In Hungary proper the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> maintained itself with difficulty in the northern districts, on account of the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, who traversed all upper Hungary, plundering the churches and laying waste the country. They also gained adherents in the southern districts, where, however, the movement was soon suppressed, thanks to the missionary activity of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/08278b.htm">James of the Marches</a>.

<p>The chief source of anxiety to the government of Hungary in Sigismund's reign was the growing power of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Since 1389 when Servia was conquered by the Osmanli power at the battle of Kosova (also called <em>Amselfeld</em>, "Field of the Blackbirds"), the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> had slowly but steadily advanced against Hungary. In 1396 Sigismund undertook a campaign on a large scale against them, but met with a severe defeat at Nicopolis. To safeguard the Hungarian frontier, Sigismund obtained from Stephen Lazarev&iacute;cs, ruler of <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, by the Treaty of Tata (Totis), in 1426, the Servian fortresses on the border of the two countries, but he was not able to hold them against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The siege of the fortress of Galamb&oacute;cz (1428) ended with his defeat and narrow escape from death. The power of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> steadily increased, and Sigismund's successors were only able to check momentarily the westward advance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>. Sigismund was succeeded by his son-in-law Albert (1437-39); in this reign the influence of the Hungarian nobility was again paramount. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> recommenced their inroads, entering the country near Szendr&ouml;. After Albert's death a dispute as to the succession arose between Wladislaw I (Wladislaw III of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>) and the adherents of Albert's posthumous son Ladislaus. In the end Wladislaw I (1442-44) became ruler; his short reign is chiefly noted for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, in which the Hungarian forces were led by <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">J&aacute;nos Hunyady</a>. Wladislaw I fell in battle with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> at Varna, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, where he was defeated; after his death Hungary was thrown into confusion by the quarrels among the ruling nobles. To put an end to these disorders the inferior nobility undertook to bring the country again into unity and made <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Hunyady</a> governor during the minority of Ladislaus V, Posthumus, appointing with him an administrative council. While at the head of the government, <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Hunyady</a> fought successfully against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. During his control of affairs also, the appointment to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> was considered the prerogative of the Crown, and it was accordingly exercised by him and his council. During the reign of Ladislaus V (1453-57) the leading nobles regained control; this led once more to disturbances, especially after the death of <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Hunyady</a>. While Ladislaus was king, Constantinople was taken by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1453), who now turned all their strength against Hungary. <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Hunyady</a> won, indeed, the brilliant victory over them at Belgrad (1456), but he died a few days later. The <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the great nobles against him was now turned against his sons, one of whom, Ladislaus, was executed. When King Ladislaus died, <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Hunyady's</a> son, <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias I, Corvinus</a>, became king.

<p><a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias I</a> (1458-90) was almost continually engaged in conflict with the Ottoman power. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> promised the most vigorous support to the king in this struggle, but the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to organize a general <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unavailing because of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> death. Notwithstanding the lack of help from other countries, <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> battled for a time with success against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in Bosnia, and to him it is due that their advance was temporarily checked. In 1463 Bosnia was conquered by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and with this the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in Bosnia ceased to exist. On account of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> invasion the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Corbavia had to be transferred to Modrus as early as 1460. Up to 1470 <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> maintained friendly relations with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but after 1471 his policy changed. The second half of his reign was characterized by a number of serious blunders. Notwithstanding the enactments of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> he gave a number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> to foreigners; in 1472 he appointed John Beckensloer <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> (Esztergom), in 1480 he gave the archdiocese to the seventeen-year-old John of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and in 1486 to Ippolito d'Este, who was seven years old. Foreigners were also appointed to the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a> (Nagy-V&aacute;rad), P&eacute;cs (F&uuml;nfkirchen), and Eger (Erlau). <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> also rewarded political services with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, and treated the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> as though it belonged to the State. His relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, originally friendly, gradually grew strained, and he went so far as to threaten to join the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. In 1488 Angelo Pecchinoli was sent to Hungary by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. Probably through the influence of his wife Beatrice, the king was led into more peaceful relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, so that there was a better condition of affairs in the last years of his reign.

<p>It was while <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> was sovereign that <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> appeared in Hungary. The king himself was a vigorous supporter of the Humanistic movement and the remains of his renowned <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at Buda, the <em>Bibliotheca Corvina</em>, still excite wonder. The king's example led others, especially the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to cultivate the arts and learning. Among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who competed with the king in the promotion of learning were Joannes Vit&eacute;z, Urban D&ouml;czi, and Thomas Bak&aacute;cz. At times, however, the ardour with which <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> supported learning slackened, thus he did not give his aid to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> already existing at P&eacute;cs (F&uuml;nfkirchen) and Pozsony (Presburg), so that later they had to be closed. After the death of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> there were once more several claimants for the throne. <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> had sought in the last years of his life to have his <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son Joannes Corvinus recognized as his successor. After his death the nation divided into two parties; one was influenced by the Queen-Dowager Beatrice, who wanted the crown for herself, the other desired a foreign ruler. Finally the King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Wladislaw II (1490-1516), of the Polish House of Jagellon, obtained the throne. In this reign the power of Hungary rapidly declined. Naturally vacillating and indolent, Wladislaw had not the force to withstand the determination of the great Hungarian nobles to rule, and the royal power became the plaything of the various parties. The antagonisms of the different ranks of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> grew more acute and led, in 1514, to a great peasant revolt, directed against the nobles and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which was only suppressed after much bloodshed. The Diet of 1498 passed enactments correcting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses that had become prevalent during the reign of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias</a> and prohibited particularly the appointment of foreigners to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> positions. Among other enactments were those that forbade the granting of church offices to any but natives, the holding of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> pluralities, and the appropriation of church lands by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Wladislaw, however, was too weak to enforce these enactments. One of the particular evils of his reign was the holding of church dignities by minors; this arose partly from the granting of the royal right of patronage to different <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. One of the most prominent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes of this period was Thomas Bak&aacute;cz, who was first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07094b.htm">Gy&ouml;r</a> and Eger, and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. His eminent qualities made him for a time a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. It was owing to his efforts that the offices of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> and <em>legatus natus</em> were permanently united with the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>.

<p>Under the successor of <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a>, Louis II (1516-26), Hungary sank into complete decay. The authority of the sovereign was no longer regarded; energetic measures could not be taken against the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, on account of the continual quarrels and dissensions, and the fate of the country was soon sealed. In 1521 Belgrad fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and Hungary was now at their mercy. In 1526 the country gathered together its resources for the decisive struggles. At the battle of Moh&aacute;cs (29 Aug., 1526) Louis II was killed, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Hungary was defeated and overthrown by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The universal political decline of Hungary in the reign of Louis II was accompanied by the decline of its <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> sank steadily, and the secular lords grew more and more daring in their seizure of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Ecclesiastical training and discipline decayed. The southern part of Hungary was almost entirely lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through the advance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Thousands of the inhabitants of the southern districts were carried off as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> or killed, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches were destroyed, and the place of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was taken by large numbers of <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Serbs</a> who were adherents of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. The Serbs had begun to settle in Hungary in the time of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias I</a>, so that during the reign of Louis II several <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> exercised their office there. In the first half of the sixteenth century the weakened condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Hungary offered a favourable opportunity to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Lutheran Reformation</a>. The new religion gained adherents especially in the cities where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give the management of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs to others; the control had thereby passed into the hands of the city authorities, who in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> claimed for themselves the right of patronage. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> German writings soon found a ready reception among the inhabitants of the cities, and before long <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preachers appeared; these came largely from <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, which had active intercourse with Hungary, and soon settled even im Buda and in the neighbourhood of the king. Exceedingly severe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed by the Hungarian Diets of 1523 and 1525 against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>; in 1523 the penalty of death and loss of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was enacted, and in 1525 the Diet condemned <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> to death at the stake. Owing to these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> did not gain much headway in Hungary before 1526. However, in the confusion which followed the death of Louis II, the new religion steadily gained ground.
<h3 id="B">From the Battle of Moh&aacute;cs to the Treaty of Szatm&aacute;r (1526-1711)</h3>

<p>Upon the death of Louis II, Hungary was once more a prey to disputes over the succession. Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> claimed the crown on the ground of a compact between the Emperor Maximilian and Wladislaw II, while the national party elected John Z&aacute;polya as king. To these two opposing elements should be added the Ottoman power, which after the conquest of Buda (1541) ruled a large part of the land. The main result of the triple political division of Hungary was the almost complete disappearance of public order and of the systematic conduct of affairs; another was the evident decline of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and the rapid advance of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The growth of the new religion was evident soon after the battle of Moh&aacute;cs. It was encouraged by the existing political conditions of Hungary: the dispute over the succession, with the accompanying civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; the lack of a properly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the transfer of a large amount of church land to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; and the claims made by both aspirants to the throne upon the episcopal domains. The foreign armies and their leaders, sent by Ferdinand I to Hungary, also aided in the spread of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which first appeared in the mountain towns of upper Hungary and then extended into the other parts of this division of the country. In western Hungary, on the farther side of the Danube, larger or smaller centres of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> sprang up under the protection of the nobility and distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. These beginnings of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> grew rapidly under such encouragement. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Hungary was not in a position to oppose this movement at the outset; a properly trained <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were lacking, on account of the difficulties in the way of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> caused by the political confusion. In the first decades there was no open rupture between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Churches, outwardly everything was <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, confession remained unchanged, and at the most Communion under both species was introduced, so that there was little apparent distinction between the two <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> occupation of Buda, in 1541, was a great blow to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Hungary. A large part of the country was now under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> sovereignty; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> gained a footing in these districts, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and chapters had to withdraw. The churches gained by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were changed into mosques, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> preachers settled in the country. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, however, did not take real hold on the population; conversions were relatively few. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> occupation promoted <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> both directly and indirectly. During this period <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> entered <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> and soon gained ascendancy there. The Hungarian Diets of 1542, 1544, and 1548 passed far-reaching enactments for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, such as banishment of the foreign preachers, the return of the sequestrated church lands, etc., but, owing to the confused state of public affairs, these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were not carried out. Besides <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> also took root in Hungary at this time, and from 1547 were added the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, who won adherents in the western counties of upper Hungary and in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. In 1556 the districts on the farther side of the Theiss accepted the Reformed religion. The revival of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began under Nicholas Ol&aacute;hus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> (1553-68), who for this purpose held a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> in 1561. He founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys at Nagy-Szombat (Tyrnau), and put the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in charge of it. His example was followed by other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the death (1564) of Ferdinand I put an end for a time to the efforts for reform in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a> of Ferdinand's successor, Maximilian II (1564-76), worked great injury to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In his earlier years Maximilian had been strongly inclined to the new creed, a fact of which the preachers of these doctrines took advantage, so that towards the end of his reign a majority of the great nobles of Hungary had become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, thereby greatly encouraging the spread of the new doctrines. Maximilian's failure to fill the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, which fell vacant in 1573, caused a further decline of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, nor did his successor, Rudolf II, fill the vacancy until some time after ascending the throne. In the first years of the reign of Rudolf II (1576-1608) religious conditions changed but little; later, the position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> improved after the entrance of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who improved the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Thus, at the end of the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were ready to carry on the struggle against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in public disputations.

<p>In this reign began the reclaiming of the churches, founded by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which had been occupied by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. At the same time also began, although slowly, the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> nobility, but the revolt of Stephen Bocskay again led to a decline of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, of 1606, secured freedom for the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and Reformed faiths, as well as for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In the reign of Matthias II (1608-19) the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of 1606 was confirmed by the Diet of 1608, and religious freedom was extended to the cities and villages. The Diet also granted the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect their own administrative heads, so that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> could now organize as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> body. The highest political <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Hungary, the dignity of <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Palatine</a> (president of the Diet and representative of the king) was in this era held by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Stephen Ill&eacute;sh&aacute;zy and George Thurz&ouml; followed each other in this office and, as was natural, defended their religion.

<p>To this period also belong the taking of a more determined position by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>. Francis Forg&aacute;ch, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nyitra (Neutra), later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, took up the struggle against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Together with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, he protested, although in vain, against the ordinances of the Diet of 1608; the Diet of 1609 rejected his protest. It also opposed Peter P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, who, as a member of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, had developed a remarkable activity. In 1613 appeared his chief work, "Hodegus", that is, "Guide to Divine Faith", to which for a long time no reply was made by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> (see PETER P&Aacute;ZM&Aacute;NY). Through the efforts of P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny and his fellow <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> formed a majority in the Diet of 1618. At this Diet the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> endeavoured to get control of the village churches also, and tried to have an enactment passed giving a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> village the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the church against the will of the lord of the manor, but they did not succeed. In 1619 a revolt for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> interests broke out; it was led by Gabriel Bethlen, ruler of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, whose cause was espoused by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> nobles of Hungary. The insurrection spread rapidly; Kassa (Kaschau), the chief town of upper Hungary, was captured by Bethlen, who by the end of 1619 was seeking to become King of Hungary. A threatened attack by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> forced Bethlen in 1620 to agree to an armistice with the king. A Diet was held at Beszterczeb&aacute;nya (Neusohl) by Bethlen in July and August, 1620, which elected him King of Hungary. The Diet confiscated the domains of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and suppressed all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> except three. Bethlen, however, was not able to maintain himself long and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, by the end of 1621, to agree to peace with Ferdinand II (1619-35) at Nikolsburg. In religious affairs the treaty was based on the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of 1606 and the enactments of the Diet of 1608.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now steadily increased. Thousands of those who had fallen away returned to the Faith. This at times led to renewed struggles when the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were not willing to consent to the return of the churches. Their efforts at the Diets to retain the churches when the lord of the manor was converted, and the serfs remained <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, failed, as what they desired was contrary to the provision of the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. During the reign of Ferdinand III (1635-57) occurred, in 1644, the insurrection for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, led by George R&aacute;k&oacute;czy I; the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> came to an end with the Peace of <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a> (1645). This treaty secured complete religious freedom even to the serfs, and contained ordinances concerning the use of the churches, cemeteries, and bells; the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> from the towns and villages was forbidden, etc. The Diet of 1646 went thoroughly into the religious question. The final decision of the king gave the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> 90 of the 400 churches they claimed; where they were not given the church they obtained suitable land for building. To carry out these ordinances, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> very difficult; strong opposition was manifested, and conditions remained very much the same up to 1670. A great change in religious affairs was caused by the discovery of the conspiracy of Francis Wessel&eacute;nyi and his companions, to make Hungary independent of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. A large number of the conspirators were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>; thus it came about that the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that broke out after the discovery of the conspiracy soon became a religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The Government succeeded in suppressing the rebellion and erected at Pozsony (Presburg) a special court for the conviction of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The revolt of Emeric Th&ouml;k&ouml;ly, in 1678, once more injured the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause; up to 1684 Th&ouml;k&ouml;ly had control of a large part of the country, and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> took up arms against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1681 the Diet was summoned to put an end to these disordered conditions. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, however, laid before it a list of demands; some of them were conceded by the king, but the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were not satisfied, and the struggle between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> did not cease for a long time. These continual dissensions brought internal affairs into great disorder, the tension between the two <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> showed itself also in social life, and the decline in moral character was evident among the population. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered great losses, churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> fell into decay, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were driven away, their possessions and lands confiscated, etc. The judgments pronounced by the courts against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> gave foreign <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes the opportunity to interfere in the internal affairs of the country, which naturally brought inconvenience with it.

<p>The recovery of Buda (Ofen) from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> led to a change very favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. There were no longer <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> revolts, and, as the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were driven out, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regained possession of its lost territories. Ecclesiastical affairs in these districts were now reorganized, new churches were built, new <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> sent, etc. In claiming its former <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> met with the opposition of the Government, which would not consent to the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lands without legal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. The relations of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> were settled by the Diet of 1687 on the basis of the enactments of the Diet of 1681; freedom of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was granted, with safeguards of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of lords-of-the-manor, the return of the banished <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> was permitted, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> nobles were allowed to build churches for their private use, etc. These enactments, however, soon <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> insufficient, and what was lacking was settled by royal edict as cases requiring decision appeared. The Diet of 1687 also acknowledged the Hungarian Crown to be hereditary in the Hapsburg <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and in addition to this renounced the free election of the king.

<p>The opening of the eighteenth century was signalized by the outbreak of a revolution headed by Francis R&aacute;k&oacute;czy II. The only damage which this did to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was that the work of consolidation and reorganization was delayed for a time. The revolt was purely political and did not degenerate into a religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; in the districts which sided with R&aacute;k&oacute;czy the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> also supported the prince. In 1705 R&aacute;k&oacute;czy held a Diet at Sz&eacute;cs&eacute;ny which passed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regarding religious questions; the religious ordinances of the Diets of 1608 and 1647 were renewed; religious freedom was granted to serfs; in those places where the population was of both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> the one to which the majority of the inhabitants belonged received the church, while the minority had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to build one for itself. After the session of the Diet of Onod, 1707, where the independence of Hungary was declared, and the Hapsburg dynasty deposed, political conditions were for a short time unfavourable to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was granted larger influence in the affairs of the Government, but this soon passed away. King Joseph I held a Diet at Pozsony (Presburg) in 1708, at which the religious question was again brought forward, but no agreement was reached. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> made large demands, but the Government would not concede more than was contained in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1681 and 1687. Soon after this the revolt headed by R&aacute;k&oacute;czy came to an end and in the Peace of <a href="../cathen/14419b.htm">Szatm&aacute;r</a> (1711) the country once more obtained rest from political disorder. The regulations of the treaty in regard to religion were that the Government should maintain the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1681 and 1687 which granted the free exercise of religion to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of every denomination; consequently religious freedom was conceded the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.
<h3 id="C">From the Peace of Szatm&aacute;r (1711) to the present time</h3>

<p>For a long period after the Peace of <a href="../cathen/14419b.htm">Szatm&aacute;r</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Hungary was undisturbed. During this era the reorganization and strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could be vigorously carried on. The colonization of the regions regained from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the later decades of the seventeenth century, and of the districts surrounding the River Temes, began after 1716. The colonists were foreigners, largely Germans, who held the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. As a result of this and other settlements, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population rapidly increased, so that in 1805 there were 5,105,381 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to 1,983,366 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The number of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> also grew greatly, especially in the country formerly under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, rule. The churches in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were reclaimed anew, but this once more led to intense friction. In order to restore religious peace, Emperor Charles VI, who was Charles Ill of Hungary (1711-40), appointed a commission for religious affairs, the decisions of which, however, were not sanctioned until 1731. These enactments, called <em>Resolutio Carolina</em>, confirmed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1681 and 1687 regarding religious affairs. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were permitted the public exercise of their religion in the western districts of the country, according to the provisions of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1681, and the private exercise of it everywhere. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> were forbidden to live outside of the places legally designated, but the members of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could seek them where they abode. The authority of the superintendents over the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> was limited to disciplinary matters; in secular matters the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> were subject to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a>. Matters pertaining to marriage were placed under the control of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; the decision, however, was given in accordance with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> enactments. In regard to <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, it was enacted that the marriage must be entered upon before the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the children be brought up in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion.

<p>Regarding church buildings the enactments of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1687 were declared to be in force. These are the more important ordinances of the <em>Resolutio</em>, which were supplemented later by various royal decisions. Charles VI was the last male descendant of the Hapsburgs, and he sought to have the succession to the throne secured to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line; this was enacted by the Diet of 1723. When Charles died his daughter <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> (1740-80), on the strength of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, succeeded him on the Hungarian throne. During her reign the ordinances of the <em>Resolutio Carolina</em> were strictly enforced; in reply to the complaints brought against it by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the queen said that she did not intend to make any concessions outside of those contained in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rapidly developed in this reign. There was no longer a lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sought to train up capable and well-educated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for the pastorate. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders increased so largely under <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> that enactments were issued in 1770 to check the growth of their numbers. According to a census of this year, there were in Hungary 3570 male religious, including 191 <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>; this number was made by law the maximum which was not to be exceeded. Great stress was also laid upon the development of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutions for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> were established, and the queen directed her attention also to advanced instruction. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Nagy-Szombat (Tyrnau), founded by Peter Pazm&aacute;ny, was completed in 1769 by the addition of a medical faculty; it was removed in 1776 to Buda, and in 1780 to Pest; in 1777 the <em>Ratio educationis</em> was issued, which regulated the entire system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> occurred during the reign of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, and the order ceased to exist in Hungary. Its possessions, which became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Crown, were used for the promotion of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. New <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were also formed at this time; in 1776 the Dioceses of Beszterczeb&aacute;nya (Neusohl), Rozsny&oacute; (Rosenau), and Szepes (Zips) were founded; in 1777 the Dioceses of Szombathely (Steinamanger), and Sz&eacute;kes Feh&eacute;v&aacute;r (Stuhlweissenburg). In regard to the filling of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, Art. XV of 1741 enacted that only natives should be appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was contrary to the custom followed by the predecessors of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, under whom it frequently happened that <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> were bestowed on foreigners. From 1770 the queen also reserved to herself the appointment of canons. The taxing of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, which had existed from 1717, and had received at that time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, was later renewed from decade to decade, and finally, in 1765, was treated as a permanent tax.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered greatly during the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> (1780-90), the son and successor of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>. The Edict of Toleration, which annulled the <em>Resolutio Carolina</em>, was issued 25 October, 1781. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> made large concessions to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; thus it was enacted that wherever there were one hundred <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> they could freely exercise their religion and might build churches without steeples or bells in such places. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were also permitted to hold public offices; it was further enacted that they could not be forced to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> opposed to their religious convictions and were released from observing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> feast days. Matters connected with the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were placed under the control of the secular courts. All the children of a <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> were to be brought up as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> when the father was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; if he were not, then only the daughters were to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. These ordinances worked much harm to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; moreover the Emperor Joseph interfered in various other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. He reserved to himself the right of founding new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were replaced by state institutions, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs were put under the control of a special Hungarian commission; edicts were also issued in regard to the administration of church lands etc. These ordinances were a source of much damage to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the emperor went even further. With a few exceptions &mdash; the teaching orders and those who had the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> &mdash; he suppressed all the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in Hungary and confiscated their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. He also provoked a rupture with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and even the journey of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> did not produce any change in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy of the emperor. The universal discontent which the edicts of the emperor had called forth <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Joseph, who had refused to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of Hungary, to withdraw before his death (1790) all his enactments, with the exception of the edict of toleration and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning the serfs.

<p>In the reign of Leopold II (1790-92), the Diet of 1790-91 granted the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> complete independence in the management of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Liberty of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was recognized, and the enactments of the Government were not allowed to affect any matters concerning <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In regard to <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> it was decreed that these should be solemnized before a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who was not permitted to prevent such a marriage. The children of a <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> were to be brought up in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> when the father was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; when he was not, then only the sons were trained in the religion of the father. While this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> various advantages, and especially guaranteed their autonomy, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered much damage. The administration continually sought to secure greater influence in its affairs; in the years of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> it demanded increasingly greater aid from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and allowed a number of the wealthiest <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> to remain vacant in order to enjoy their revenues during vacancy. Thus, for example, the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for nearly twenty years. During the reign of Francis I (1792-1835) there was no change for a long period in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. For this the king was largely responsible; he looked with no friendly eye on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> activity in politics, although the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, on account of their position in the country and their wealth, were well fitted to take part in political affairs. The Dioceses of Kassa (Kaschau) and Szatm&aacute;r were founded in 1804, and at a later date the Diocese of Eger (Erlau) was raised to an archdiocese with the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Szepes</a> (Zips), Rozsny&oacute; (Rosenau), Kassa (Kaschau), and Szatm&aacute;r as suffragans. In 1802 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Orders were re-established. In order to elevate <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, the Prince Primate Alexander Rudnay held a great <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> in 1822, at which ordinances in regard to the improvement of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were passed.

<p>It was not until the Diet of 1832-36 that the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were again brought up. The occasion was the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> and of changes to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a>. In regard to the latter, Art. XXVI of 1791, Sec. 13, decreed that the change to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> could only take place with royal permission and after six weeks' instruction. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> made strenuous efforts to have this article of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> annulled, but for a long time they were not successful. It was not until the Diet of 1844 that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> secured a settlement of the matter in accordance with their wishes; Art. III of 1844 repealed the requirements of the royal consent and the six weeks' instruction, and decreed instead that the change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must be twice notified to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> within four weeks in the presence of two witnesses. If the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> refused to grant a certificate of this fact, the witnesses could draw it up.

<p>The second question that arose in this period, that of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, had been last regulated by the Diet of 1790-91. The law contained enactments, as mentioned above, concerning the religion of children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, but the cases increased in which the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> made a formal declaration promising to bring the children up as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1793 there was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> agitation against this declaration, and when, in the years 1830-40, the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> was discussed in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the controversy in that country influenced conditions in Hungary. In <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> continued to demand the signing of a formal declaration. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nagy-V&aacute;rad (Grosswardein) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to order (1839) that only those <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> could have the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which the religion of the children was settled by a declaration in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> demanded again from the Diet of 1839-40 the suppression of the declaration. The pastoral letter of 2 July, 1840, of the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> bound the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to passive assistance in <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> in which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests were not guarded &mdash; that is, where the formal declaration was not made. This ordinance aroused much feeling, and several <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were fined on account of passive assistance. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> now turned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> confirmed the pastoral letter, with the addition that <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> were indeed forbidden, but that such marriages were valid, even when not entered on before a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, if two witnesses were present. The Diet of 1843-44 allowed <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> to be entered upon before <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mother, however, received the right, with the permission of the father, to bring up all of the children in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.

<p>The agitation of 1848 and the Hungarian Revolution of 1848-49, besides changing political and social conditions, also affected the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Diet of 1848 decreed the equality and reciprocity of all recognized confessions. In 1849 the minister of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and public worship, Horv&aacute;th, desired to grant <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> autonomy, but after the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution it came to nothing. Large numbers of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> took part in the Hungarian Revolution, a fact which in the following years of absolutism led to their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the Government. During the period of autocratic rule the ordinances of the Austrian Concordat of 1855 were made authoritative for Hungary also, and in accordance with its enactments <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> for settling various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs were held in 1858 and 1863. Although the Concordat granted greater freedom to the Hungarian Church, yet the administration of the fund for religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> remained in the hands of the Government. In 1853 political reasons led to the elevation of the <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Diocese of Z&aacute;gr&aacute;b (Agram)</a> to an archdiocese having as suffragans the Sees of <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a>, <a href="../cathen/15754c.htm">Zengg-Modrus</a>, and K&ouml;r&ouml;s, and later to the founding of the <a href="../cathen/06123a.htm">Archdiocese of Fogaras</a>. The erection of this archdiocese violated the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Hungary; this led to repeated, but ineffectual, protests.

<p>The period of absolutism in Hungary came to an end with the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Francis Joseph I as King of Hungary (8 June, 1867), and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of 1848 were once more in force. The responsible parliamentary Government and Parliament exercised much influence on the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> touching <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions undoubtedly worked much injury to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the Common School Law of 1868 (Art. XXXVIII), which left to the inhabitants of a community the decision as to whether the common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was to be denominational or communal; also Art. XLVIII which, in regard to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> in <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, enacted that such cases might be brought by the respective parties before the competent spiritual authorities recognized by each, and that each must be bound by the decision of his, or her, own spiritual authority. This enactment led many to change to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a>. Art. LIII of 1868 enacted, in regard to the children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, that the children should follow the creed of the parent of the same sex, and that this must be enforced even after the death of the parent, as, for example, after the death of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> father, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mother could not bring up in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> the minor children belonging to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> confession. It was also decreed that, when one of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> changed his religion, the child could not follow this change unless under seven years of age. These enactments led later to a bitter ecclesiastico-political struggle.

<p>Various efforts were made in Parliament, between 1869-72, to injure the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as in the bills introducing <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, civil registration, complete religious liberty, etc. However, of these measures, those regarding <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriages</a>, the keeping of the registers by civil officials, etc., were not enforced until a much later date. Serious complications arose upon the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870. The Government, supported by the <em>jus placeti</em>, forbade its publication; a royal reproof was sent in 1871 to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sz&eacute;kes-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r (Stuhlweissenburg), Jekelfalussy, who officially published the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1872-75) produced in Hungary a movement hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Agitation was also caused by the passing of Art. XI of 1879; it enacted that the reception into another <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a>, in so far as it was contrary to Art. LIII of 1868, was subject to legal penalty. The difficulties arising from the interpretation of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> lasted for a long time. In 1883 a bill on the marriage of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was laid before the Parliament but was twice rejected by the Upper House and finally withdrawn by the Government. The ministry of Koloman Tisza, which lasted longer (1875-89) than any other since 1867, inflicted further damage upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> spread in all directions and received active support from the Government. The revision of the constitution of the Upper House (House of Magnates) in 1885 (Art. VII) excluded <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> from membership, with the exception of the Auxiliary Bishops of N&aacute;ndor-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r and Knin (Tinin) According to this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, both of the Latin and Greek Rites, entitled to membership in the Upper House since that time are the prince-primate and the other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the Auxiliary Bishops of N&aacute;ndor-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r and Knin, the Archabbot of Pannonhalma (Martinsberg), the Provost of J&aacute;sz&oacute; (<a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian Order</a>), and the Prior of Auranien; the representatives of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> are the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Karlocza (Karlowitz), the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Gyula-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r (Karlsburg), and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Churches</a>, their highest <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay dignitaries.

<p>In the first years of the last decade of the nineteenth century a far-reaching movement threatened the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Hungary. An ecclesiastico-political conflict began, caused by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Minister of Education and Public Worship, Count Cs&aacute;ky. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> provided that any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who performed a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> according to Art. LIII of 1868 must send a certificate of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the legally responsible <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> within eight days. Neglect to obey this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was to be considered a misdemeanour, and punished accordingly. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, called the <em>Wegtaufung</em> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> away from the other side) marked the beginning of a new ecclesiastico-political conflict. According to this edict a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a child belonging to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must send the certificate of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the minister of the other denomination; such an enactment was regarded by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as contrary to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and the canonical ordinances. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not order that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> be carried out, although they declared that for a time it could be tolerated; the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, however, refused to obey it. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> agitation for the modification in the interest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Art. LIII of 1868, and for the repeal of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> issued by Cs&aacute;ky, did not succeed, while the supporters of the Government soon made use of the movement to further the introduction of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, civil registration, and the free exercise of religion. These latter proposals became law during the premiership of Alexander Wekerle. In 1893 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bills were laid before the Diet, and after long debates, being once rejected by the House of Magnates, they became law in 1894 and took effect 1 October, 1895. Articles XXXI and XXXIII of 1894 contain enactments regarding marriage and registration. Civil marriage is made compulsory, and government recognition is only given to civil registration. Article XXXII of 1894 enacts that the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> can enter into an agreement before the registrar as to the religion of the children. Registrars are appointed by the minister of the interior and are responsible to him; a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot be appointed to this office. The Hungarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> protested against these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and sent a memorial to the king requesting him not to sanction them; they were, however, unsuccessful. Article XLII of 1895 gave official recognition to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>; at the same time the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to belong to no confession was granted.

<p>A <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> did not, as had been feared, follow the passage of the ecclesiastico-political <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Nevertheless, they led to the formation of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> parliamentary party, the People's Party (<em>Volkspartei</em>), which made the revision of the ecclesiastico-political <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the chief measure of their programme. As early as the election for members of the Diet which followed the taking effect of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the People's Party nominated candidates and up to the parliamentary election of 1906 it had 33 adherents among the members of the Lower House. The large proportions which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement assumed in Hungary are due to this party. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations were founded in all parts of the land, and finally a union was formed which embraced the entire country. This reawakened <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consciousness led to the holding of national <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congresses, which have now met for a number of years. These congresses have aided greatly in the strengthening and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinions. The efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Hungary to gain autonomy for the protection of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, especially in regard to the administration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> foundations and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, have so far been unsuccessful. The Diet of 1791 granted autonomy to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> neglected, at that time, to secure the same for themselves. It was not until 1848 that the first steps in this direction were taken by the holding of an episcopal conference to discuss the question. Nothing, however, resulted from these efforts, and the quickly following outbreak of the Revolution put the matter aside for the time being, nor was the question brought up during the period of absolutism. After the restoration of constitutional government the question of the autonomy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was again raised, and in 1867 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had a plan drawn up, which in 1868 was laid before a large assembly. In 1870 a congress for the promotion of autonomy was called, and a commission appointed which in 1871 presented its first report. According to the plan it outlined there were to be formed a national congress and an administrative council. The national congress was to be under the guidance of the prince <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>; subordinate to the congress were to be the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> conventions with a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> senate; below, there were to be the decanal and district senates, following which were the communal assemblies and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The incorporated autonomy council was to represent the interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to administer the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, and to be the advisory council of the king in the appointment of church dignitaries. The Congress of 1871 accepted this plan and laid it before the king, but no practical results followed. After this but little was done in the matter until 1897, when a new congress for the promotion of autonomy was called. A commission was appointed which finished its labours in three years, and in 1900 the congress reassembled. The plan of the majority claimed autonomy almost entirely for the episcopate and left the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the Government. The opposition party in the congress demanded the control of the funds, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> for the congress. The discussions lasted through the years 1901-1902; in the latter year the congress closed its labours and laid the results before the king, who reserved his decision. Since then nothing more has been done in the matter.

<p>In 1909, after long negotiations, the question of the equalization of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> salaries was finally settled (Art. XIII of 1909). The principal provisions of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> fix the salary of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of recognized <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> at 1600 Kronen ($320) with a minimum of 800 Kronen ($160); that of <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> and assistant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> at 1000 Kronen ($200), with a minimum of 800 Kronen ($160); the value of I board and lodging is included in the salary of a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> or assistant, and this is reckoned at 500 Kronen ($100). In order to meet the expenses of the equalization, the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are annually taxed to the amount of 700,000 Kronen ($140,000), and the Hungarian fund for religion to the amount of 1,200,000 Kronen ($240,000). Ecclesiastical affairs are under the control of the Hungarian Ministry of Education and Public Worship, in which a separate department, having one of the higher church dignitaries at its head, has been formed. The appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, canons, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, etc. belongs to the king and follows upon the presentation of the names, with ministerial approval, by the minister of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and public worship. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> enter upon their office, take their seats in the House of Magnates, and receive their revenues without awaiting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation. A royal edict of 1870 revived the old royal <em>jus placeti</em> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that only after receiving royal approval could decisions, constitutions, and decrees of councils and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in Hungary. It should also be mentioned that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ne Temere", recently issued by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, was not enforced in Hungary, owing to the representations of the Hungarian episcopate, but the provisions of the Constitution "Provida", issued for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the same matter, 18 January, 1906, were also extended to Hungary.
<h2>Actual conditions</h2>

<p>The Church in Hungary, in respect to organization, is divided into the three <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> (Esztergom), Kalocsa, and Eger (Erlau). The suffragans of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> are the Dioceses of Beszterczeb&aacute;nya (Neusohl), Gy&ouml;r (Raab), Nyitra (Neutra), P&eacute;cs (F&uuml;nfkirchen), Sz&eacute;kes-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r (Stuhlweissenburg), Szombathely (Steinamanger), V&aacute;cz (Waitzen), and <a href="../cathen/15392a.htm">Veszpr&eacute;m</a>. The suffragans of Kalocsa are the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04558b.htm">Csan&aacute;d</a>, <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, and Nagy-V&aacute;rad (Grosswardein). The suffragans of Eger (Erlau) are the Dioceses of Kassa (Kaschau), Rozsny&oacute; (Rosenau), <a href="../cathen/14419b.htm">Szatm&aacute;r</a>, and Szepes (Zips). The head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the Metropolitan Prince Primate, the Prince <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> (Esztergom). There is also in Hungary proper an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> which is equal in rank to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Pannonhalma (Martinsberg). The Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia has one archdiocese that of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Z&aacute;gr&aacute;b (Agram)</a>. Its suffragans are the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a> (Bosnia, or Diakov&aacute;r and Szerem), and <a href="../cathen/15754c.htm">Zengg-Modrus</a>. There are two <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> in Hungary, Gran (Esztergom) and Gyula-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r-Fogaras. The suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Archdiocese of Gran</a> (Esztergom) are Munk&aacute;cs and Eperjes; those of Gyula-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r-Fogaras are <a href="../cathen/09419a.htm">Lugos</a>, Nagy-V&aacute;rad (Grosswardein), Szamos-Ujvar, and the Diocese of K&ouml;r&ouml;s(Kreuz) in Croatia.

<p>The Reformed Church is divided into four districts; the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a> into five districts. The Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> is governed by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Karl&oacute;cza (Karlowitz), who has under him the Dioceses of B&aacute;cs, Buda, Temesv&aacute;r, and Versecz. The Orthodox <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> is governed by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Nagy-Szeben (Hermannstadt), who has under him the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01677a.htm">Arad</a> and Kar&aacute;nsebes. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Karl&oacute;cza (Karlowitz) has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> also over the Dioceses of K&aacute;rolyv&aacute;ros (Karlstadt) and Pakr&aacute;cz in <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian Church</a> is divided into 9 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> with 113 mother-churches and 111 <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Kolozsv&aacute;r (Klausenburg). The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are divided into three communities, the Congress, Status Quo, and Orthodox communities. In 1905 the Baptist Church was added to the legally recognized <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, but only the community at Budapest, which in 1907 had 190 stations, was sanctioned as an organized community.

<p>According to the Hungarian census of 1900 the adherents of the different religions number as follows:
