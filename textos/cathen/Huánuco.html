<h1>Hu&aacute;nuco</h1>  

<p>(Huanucensis)

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>.

<p>The department of Hu&aacute;nuco contains an area of 14,027 sq. miles, and a population of 145,309 (1896). The capital of the same name (also called San Leon de Hu&aacute;nuco), situated on the left bank of the upper course of the Huallaga, a tributary entering the Amazon on its right, is 5945 feet above sea-level and has a population of about 7500. Hu&aacute;nuco is one of the oldest Spanish colonies of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, having been founded as early as 1539 (four years after the foundation of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>) by G&oacute;mez de Alvarado at the instance of Francisco Pizarro. Soon after the erection of the first houses, however, they were levelled to the ground during an insurrection of the Indians. After the assassination of Pizarro (1541), Pedro de Puelles was empowered by the governor, Crist&oacute;bal Vaca de Castro, to lead a new colony into the Huallaga valley. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the city attained a high degree of prosperity, counting at one time, it is said, as many as 70,000 inhabitants. The city owned its rapid rise chiefly to the rich silver mines of the neighbouring Cerro de Pasco; the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the nineteenth century, however, wrought such ravages that at present it is nothing but a wretched town of scattered houses, relying for its support chiefly on the cultivation of fruits, coffee, and sugar-cane. The city contains besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on the Plaza, fourteen churches, including those formerly in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (Santo Domingo, not completed) and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (San Francisco with a gilded altar).

<p>The Diocese of Hu&aacute;nuco was created by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 17 March, 1865. He decreed that the (former) department of Junin, consisting of the provinces of Hu&aacute;nuco, Huamalies, Pasco, Tauia, and Tarma, be separated from the <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Archdiocese of Lima</a> and established as a new diocese, with the seat at Hu&aacute;nuco. The Government undertook to provide for the episcopal mensal revenue, and to erect a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and an episcopal palace. With regard to the chapter to be formed, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> stipulated that, owing to the dearth of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, it should consist of only one dignitary and six canons. Mgr Sebastiano Goyeniche Darreda, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, was named executor of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which received government ratification on 5 July, 1865, the erection of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> being authorized on 20 November, 1868. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Manuel Teodoro del Valle, presented for <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> on 5 June, 1866, was preferred to the <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Archdiocese of Lima</a>, 29 August, 1872, and on 19 November of the same year named titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Berytus, in which capacity he was vested with the administration of his former Diocese of Hu&aacute;nuco (11 January, 1873). He was succeeded by Alfonso Maria de la Cruz Sardinas, O.F.M., who was appointed on 31 October, 1889, <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> 12 August, 1890, and died in June, 1902. The third and present (1909) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Mgr Pedro Pablo Drinot y Pi&eacute;rola of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart (Picpus Society), born at Callao, 26 November, 1859, presented by the Government for <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, 27 February, 1904, <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> 19 August, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> on 24 August of the same year.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>According to its present delimitation, the Diocese of Hu&aacute;nuco embraces the two departments of Hu&aacute;nuco and Jun&iacute;n, comprising about 37,380 (according to other authorities 41,586) square miles and 539,702 inhabitants, of whom 288,100 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the rest for the most part uncivilized Indians. It contains 45 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 210 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 75 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. West of the present city of Hu&aacute;nuco is Hu&aacute;nuco Viejo (Old Hu&aacute;nuco), an ancient Inca settlement with the ruins of old <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> monuments. These include a temple constructed out of massive square blocks of stone, called El Castillo, a royal palace, and extensive ruins of dwellings, with which are connected a series of singular towers along the slope of the hill, used by the early inhabitants as store or provision-houses. Farther inland on the River Pozuzo, but within the limits of the department of Hu&aacute;nuco, is the German colony of Pozuzo, established in 1859 by Freiherr von Schutz-Holzhausen; it has about 600 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the Rhineland and the Tyrol, with their own German <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>.
