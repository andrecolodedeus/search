<h1>Ibas</h1>  

<p>(Syriac IHIBA or HIBA, i.e. DONATUS)

<p>Elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in 439 as <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a> of Rabbulas, one of the most ardent supporters of St. Cyril; d. 457. His policy, however, was just the reverse, as he inclined strongly to the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>. His reign as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was most disturbed. The infuriated partisans of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> protested and had him deposed at the Second Synod of Ephesus (the "Robber Synod"), in 449. He was, however, restored to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451). Ibas holds a very important place in the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Unfortunately the only authentic writing of his that we possess is his celebrated letter to Maris of Beit-Ardashir (i.e. to Dadish&ocirc;, <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>), a famous subject of discussion at six councils. By the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> he was accused of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, nor can it be denied that he was in complete sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Antioch, whose masters were <a href="../cathen/05008a.htm">Diodorus of Tarsus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret of Cyrus</a>. He taught for many years in the "Persian School" at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, where he had among his pupils several future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Persian Church; he inspired them with admiration for <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and translated for them or had them translate the latter's works, so that the Syrian <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> call the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10555a.htm">Mopsuestia</a>, by antonomasia, the <em>Interpreter</em>. However, Ibas protests that he did not approve Nestorius when that patriarch refused the title of <em>Mother of God</em> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>: he only blames the methods adopted by Cyril to procure the condemnation of Nestorius; this much he openly declares in his letter to Maris. Moreover, at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, he <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> Nestorius both orally and in writing, and was rehabilitated almost unanimously by the Fathers. He indignantly repudiated certain assertions attributed to him by his adversaries, for instance: "I do not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> His becoming <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for I can become <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no less than He," and there is no reason for doubting the sincerity of his protestations. What is certain is, that to avoid all suspicion of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, i.e. the confusion, or rather fusion, of the Divine <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he did not admit what is called the <em>communicatio idiomatum</em>, i.e. the possibility of attributing to the Divine Person the concrete attributes of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> the concrete attributes of the Divine Person. But that is not a sufficient reason for impugning his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, as this theory was in his time far from being full and clearly expounded. At the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> the Patriarch Maximus of Antioch and the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> declared: "Having read his letter again, we declare that he is <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>." But the Fathers did not adopt that opinion unanimously.

<p>A hundred years later, the letter of Ibas to Maris was one of the famous <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a> condemned at the fifth ecumenical council (553), at the instigation of Justinian. Among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of that council some, like the Westerns, thought that, as the council of Chalcedon had rehabilitated Ibas, to condemn his writings would be equivalent to condemning that council, in other words to approve its <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> adversaries. Others, in the hope of conciliating the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> partisans known as Severians, thought it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to condemn once more, not only Nestorius, but also all writings that inclined towards <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>; they thought the letter of Ibas was impious, because it <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> St. Cyril, criticized the procedure of the Council of Ephesus, and seemed to justify Nestorius and the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>; others asserted, however, that the letter was <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. In the eighth session (2 June, 553) the council declared: "If anyone defends the aforesaid letter and does not <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> it, it and him who defends it and who says that it is wholly or at least in part correct. . .let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>." Pope Virgilius, who had at first expressed a contrary opinion, and for that reason was attacked by <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a>, ended by sanctioning the decisions of the council. It is to be remarked that it was not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Ibas, but only his letter to Maris, that was condemned on this occasion.
