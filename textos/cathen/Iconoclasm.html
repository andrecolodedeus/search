<h1>Iconoclasm</h1>  

<p>Iconoclasm (<em>Eikonoklasmos</em>, "Image-breaking") is the name of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that in the eighth and ninth centuries disturbed the peace of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, caused the last of the many breaches with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that prepared the way for the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Photius, and was echoed on a smaller scale in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom in the West. The story in the East is divided into two separate persecutions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, at the end of each of which stands the figure of an image-worshipping Empress (Irene and Theodora).
<h2 id="section1">The first Iconoclast persecution</h2>

<p>The origin of the movement against the worship (for the use of this word see <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">VENERATION OF IMAGES</a>) of images has been much discussed. It has been represented as an effect of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> influence. To <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, any kind of picture, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, or representation of the human form is an abominable idol. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, in a sense, the Khalifa at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> began the whole disturbance, and that the Iconoclast emperors were warmly applauded and encouraged in their campaign by their rivals at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>. On the other hand it is not likely that the chief cause of the emperor's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against pictures was the example of his bitter enemy, the head of the rival religion. A more probable origin will be found in the opposition to pictures that had existed for some time among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. There seems to have been a dislike of holy pictures, a suspicion that their use was, or might become, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> among certain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for many centuries before the Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> began (see <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">VENERATION OF IMAGES</a>). The <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, as part of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> held that all matter (especially the human body) is bad, that all external religious forms, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, rites, especially material pictures and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, should be abolished. To <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Cross was especially reprehensible, since Christ had not really been crucified. Since the seventh century these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had been allowed to have occasional great influence at Constantinople intermittently with suffering very cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">PAULICIANS</a>). But some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, too shared their dislike of pictures and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. In the beginning of the eighth century several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Constantine of <a href="../cathen/10667b.htm">Nacolia</a> in Phrygia, Theodosius of Ephesus, Thomas of Claudiopolis, and others are mentioned as having these views. A <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Xenaeas of Hierapolis, was a conspicuous forerunner of the Iconoclasts (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> IV, 306). It was when this party got the ear of the Emperor Leo III (the Isaurian, 716-41) that the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> began.

<p>The first act in the story is a similar <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the domain of the Khalifa at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>. Yezid I (680-683) and his successors, especially Yezid II (720-24), thinking, like good <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, that all pictures are idols, tried to prevent their use among even their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects. But this <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in itself only one of many such intermittent annoyances to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, is unimportant except as the forerunner of the troubles in the empire. Leo the Isaurian was a valiant soldier with an autocratic temper. Any movement that excited his sympathy was sure to be enforced sternly and cruelly. He had already cruelly <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>. He was also suspected of leanings towards <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. The Khalifa Omar II (717-20) tried to convert him, without success except as far as persuading him that pictures are idols. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> enemies of images, notably Constantine of <a href="../cathen/10667b.htm">Nacolia</a>, then easily gained his ear. The emperor came to the conclusion that images were the chief hindrance to the conversion of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, the cause of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, weakness, and division in his empire, and opposed to the First Commandment. The campaign against images as part of a general reformation of the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Leo III's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was to purify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, centralize it as much as possible under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and thereby strengthen and centralize the State of the empire. There was also a strong <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendency among there Iconoclast emperors, a reaction against the forms of Byzantine <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that became more pronounced each century. This <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> helps to explain their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Once persuaded, Leo began to enforce his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> ruthlessly. Constantine of <a href="../cathen/10667b.htm">Nacolia</a> came to the capital in the early part of his reign; at the same time John of <a href="../cathen/14387a.htm">Synnada</a> wrote to the patriarch Germanus I (715-30), warning him that Constantine had made a disturbance among the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province by preaching against the use of holy pictures. Germanus, the first of the heroes of the image-worshippers (his letters in <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, IV 239-62), then wrote a defence of the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> addressed to another Iconoclast, Thomas of Claudiopolis (l. c. 245-62). But Constantine and Thomas had the emperor on their side. In 726 Leo III published an edict declaring images to be idols, forbidden by <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#vrs4">Exodus 20:4-5</a>, and commanding all such images in churches to be destroyed. At once the soldiers began to carry out his orders, whereby disturbances were provoked throughout the empire. There was a famous picture of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, called <em>Christos antiphonetes</em>, over the gate of the palace at Constantinople. The destruction of this picture provoked a serious riot among the people. Germanus, the patriarch, protested against the edict and appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (729). But the emperor deposed him as a traitor (730) and had Anastasius (730-54), formerly syncellus of the patriarchal Court, and a willing instrument of the Government, appointed in his place. The most steadfast opponents of the Iconoclasts throughout this story were the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there were some who took the side of the emperor but as a body <a href="../cathen/10467a.htm">Eastern monasticism</a> was steadfastly loyal to the old custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Leo therefore joined with his Iconoclasm a fierce <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and eventually tried to suppress monasticism altogether.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at that time was <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a> (713-31). Even before he had received the appeal of Germanus a letter came from the emperor commanding him to accept the edict, destroy images at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and summon a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to forbid their use. <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory</a> answered, in 727, by a long defence of the pictures. He explains the difference between them and idols, with some surprise that Leo does not already understand it. He describes the lawful use of, and reverence paid to, pictures by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. He blames the emperor's interference in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters and his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of image-worshippers. A council is not wanted; all Leo has to do is to stop disturbing the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As for Leo's threat that he will come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, break the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Peter (apparently the famous bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in St. Peter's), and take the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory</a> answers it by pointing out that he can easily escape into the Campagna, and reminding the emperor how futile and now abhorrent to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was Constans's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Martin I</a>. He also says that all people in the West detest the emperor's action and will never consent to destroy their images at his command (Greg. II, "Ep. I ad Leonem"). The emperor answered, continuing his argument by saying that no general council had yet said a word in favour of images that he himself is emperor and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<em>basileus kai lereus</em>) in one and therefore has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make decrees about such matters. <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory</a> writes back regretting that Leo does not yet see the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his ways. As for the former general Councils, they did not pretend to discuss every point of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; it was unnecessary in those days to defend what no one attacked. The title <em>Emperor and Priest</em> had been conceded as a compliment to some sovereigns because of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defending the very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that Leo now attacked. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declares himself determined to withstand the emperor's tyranny at any cost, though he has no defence but to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that Christ will send a demon to torture the emperor's body that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be saved, according to 1 Corinthians 5:5.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> raged in the East. Monasteries were destroyed, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, tortured, or banished. The Iconoclasts began to apply their principle to <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> also, to break open shrines and burn the bodies of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> buried in churches. Some of them rejected all intercession of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. These and other points (destruction of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and rejection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>), though not necessarily involved in the original programme are from this time generally (not quite always) added to Iconoclasm. Meanwhile, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (d. 754). safe from the emperor's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> under the rule of the Khalifa was writing at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St Saba his famous apologies "against those who destroy the holy icons". In the West, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the people rose against the emperor's law. This anti-imperial movement is one of the factors of the breach between <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the old empire, the independence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a> already refused to send taxes to Constantinople and himself appointed the imperial <em>dux</em> in the <em>Ducatos Romanus</em>. From this time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> becomes practically sovereign of the <em>Ducatus</em>. The emperor's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against image-worshippers was strengthened by a revolt that broke out about this time in Hellas, ostensibly in favour of the icons. A certain Cosmas was set up as emperor by the rebels. The insurrection was soon crushed (727), and Cosmas was beheaded. After this a new and severer edict against images was published (730), and the fury of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was redoubled.

<p><a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Pope Gregory II</a> died in 731. He was succeeded at once by <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a>, who carried on the defence of <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a> in exactly the spirit of his predecessor. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, George, with letters against Iconoclasm to Constantinople. But George when he arrived, was afraid to present them, and came back without having accomplished his mission. He was sent a second time on the same errand, but was arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by the imperial governor. The emperor now proceeded with his policy of enlarging and strengthening his own <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> at Constantinople. He conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of making it as great as all the empire over which he still actually ruled. Isauria, Leo's birthplace, was taken from Antioch by an imperial edict and added to the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, increasing it by the Metropolis, <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, and about twenty other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Leo further pretended to withdraw Illyricum from the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and to add it to that of Constantinople, and confiscated all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> on which he could lay his hands, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This naturally increased the enmity between <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a>. In 731 <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> held a synod of ninety-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at St. Peter's in which all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who broke, defiled, or took images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of His Mother, the Apostles or other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were declared <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Constantine, was sent with a copy of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and of its application to the emperor, but was again arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Leo then sent a fleet to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to punish the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; but it was wrecked and dispersed by a storm. Meanwhile every kind of calamity afflicted the empire; earthquakes, pestilence, and famine devastated the provinces while the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> continued their victorious career and conquered further territory.

<p>Leo III died in June, 741, in the midst of these troubles, without having changed policy. His work was carried on by his son Constantine V (Copronymus, 741-775), who became an even greater persecutor of image-worshippers than had been his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. As soon as Leo III was dead, Artabasdus (who had married Leo's daughter) seized the opportunity and took advantage of the unpopularity of the Iconoclast Government to raise a rebellion. Declaring himself the protector of the holy icons he took possession of the capital, had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by the pliant patriarch Anastasius and immediately restored the images. Anastasius, who had been intruded in the place of Germanus as the Iconoclast candidate, now veered round in the usual Byzantine way, helped the restoration of the images and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Constantine V as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and denier of Christ. But Constantine marched on the city, took it, blinded Artabasdus and began a furious revenge on all rebels and image-worshippers (743). His treatment of Anastasius is a typical example of the way these later emperors behaved towards the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> through whom they tried to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Anastasius was flogged in public, blinded, driven shamefully through the streets, made to return to his Iconoclasm and finally reinstated as patriarch. The wretched man lived on till 754. The pictures restored by Artabasdus were again removed. In 754 Constantine, taking up his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> original <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> summoned a great synod at Constantinople that was to count as the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a>. About 340 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> attended; as the See of Constantinople was vacant by the death of Anastasius, Theodosius of Ephesus and Pastilias of <a href="../cathen/11667a.htm">Perge</a> presided. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> refused to send <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, since it was clear that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were summoned merely to carry out the emperor's commands. The event showed that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> had judged rightly. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the synod servilely agreed to all Constantine's demands. They decreed that images of Christ are either <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> or <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, for &#151; since it is impossible to represent His Divinity &#151; they either confound or <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> His two natures. The only lawful representation of Christ is the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Images of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are equally to be abhorred; it is blasphemous to represent by dead wood or stone those who live with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All images are an invention of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> &#151; are in fact idols, as shown by Ex xx, 4, 5; Deut. v, 8; John iv, 24; Rom. i, 23-25. Certain texts of the Fathers are also quoted in support of Iconoclasm. Image-worshippers are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, adorers of wood and stone; the Emperors Leo and Constantine are lights of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, our saviours from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. A special curse is pronounced against three chief defenders of images &#151; Germanus, the former <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, George of Cyprus. The synod declares that "the Trinity has destroyed these three" ("Acts of the Iconoclast Synod of 754" in Mansi XIII, 205 sq.).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> finally elected a successor to the vacant see of Constantinople, Constantine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sylaeum (Constantine II, 754-66), who was of course a creature of the Government, prepared to carry on its campaign. The decrees were published in the Forum on 27 August, 754. After this the destruction of pictures went on with renewed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. All the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire were required to sign the Acts of the synod and to swear to do away with icons in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> were now treated well, while image-worshippers and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were fiercely <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Instead of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> the churches were decorated with pictures of flowers, fruit, and birds, so that the people said that they looked like grocery stores and bird shops. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Peter was scourged to death on 7 June, 761; the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Monagria, John, who refused to trample on an icon, was tied up in a sack and thrown into the sea on 7 June, 761; in 767 Andrew, a Cretan <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, was flogged and lacerated till he died (see the Acta SS., 8 Oct.; Roman Martyrology for 17 Oct.); in November of the same year a great number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were tortured to death in various ways (Martyrology, 28 Nov.). The emperor tried to abolish monasticism (as the centre of the defence of images); <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were turned into barracks; the monastic habit was forbidden; the patriarch Constantine II was made to swear in the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> of his church that although formerly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, he had now joined the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">Relics</a> were dug up and thrown into the sea, the invocation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> forbidden. In 766 the emperor fell foul of his patriarch, had him scourged and beheaded and replaced by Nicetas I (766-80), who was, naturally also an obedient servant of the Iconoclast Government. Meanwhile the countries which the emperors power did not reach kept the old custom and broke communion with the Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople and his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Cosmas of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Theodore of Antioch, and Theodore of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were all defenders of the holy icons in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Emperor Constantine V died in 775. His son Leo IV (775-80), although he did not repeal the Iconoclast law was much milder in enforcing them. He allowed the exiled <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to come back, tolerated at least the intercession of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and tried to reconcile all parties. When the patriarch Nicetas I died in 780 he was succeeded by Paul IV (780-84), a Cypriote <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who carried on a half-hearted Iconoclast policy only through fear of the Government. But Leo IV's wife Irene was a steadfast image-worshipper. Even during her husband's life she concealed holy icons in her rooms. At the end of his reign Leo had a burst of fiercer Iconoclasm. He punished the courtiers who had replaced images in their apartments and was about to banish the empress when he died 8 September, 780. At once a complete reaction set in.
<h2 id="section2">The second general council (Nic&aelig;a II, 787)</h2>

<p>The Empress Irene was regent for her son Constantine VI (780-97), who was nine years old when his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died. She immediately set about undoing the work of the Iconoclast emperors. Pictures and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were restored to the churches; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were reopened. Fear of the army, now fanatically Iconoclast, kept her for a time from repealing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; but she only waited for an opportunity to do so and to restore the broken communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, Paul IV, resigned and retired to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, giving openly as his reason repentance for his former concessions to the Iconoclast Government. He was succeeded by a pronounced image-worshipper, Tarasius. Tarasius and the empress now opened negotiations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They sent an embassy to <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> (772-95) acknowledging the primacy and begging him to come himself, or at least to send <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to a council that should undo the work of the Iconoclast synod of 754. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> answered by two letters, one for the empress and one for the patriarch. In these he repeats the arguments for the worship of images agrees to the proposed council, insists on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and demands the restitution of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated by Leo III. He blames the sudden elevation of Tarasius (who from being a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> had suddenly become patriarch), and rejects his title of <em>Ecumenical Patriarch</em>, but he praises his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a>. Finally, he commits all these matters to the judgment of his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. These <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were an <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Peter and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Peter of St. Saba near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The other three <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were unable to answer, they did not even receive Tarasius's letters, because of the disturbance at that time in the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> state. But two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Thomas, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and John Syncellus of Antioch, appeared with letters from their communities explaining the state of things and showing that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> had always remained faithful to the images. These two seem to have acted in some sort as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> for Alexandria, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>Tarasius opened the synod in the church of the Apostles at Constantinople. in August, 786; but it was at once dispersed by the Iconoclast soldiers. The empress disbanded those troops and replaced them by others; it was arranged that the synod should meet at Nicaea in Bithynia, the place of the first general council. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met here in the summer of 787, about 300 in number. The council lasted from 24 September to 23 October. The Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were present; they signed the Acts first and always had the first place in the list of members, but Tarasius conducted the proceeding, apparently because the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> could not speak Greek. In the first three sessions Tarasius gave an account of the events that had led up to the Council, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and other letters were read out, and many repentant Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were reconciled. The fathers accepted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> formulas of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Tarasius, when he read the letters, left out the passages about the restitution of the confiscated <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> properties, the reproaches against his own sudden elevation and use of the title <em>Ecumenical Patriarch</em>, and modified (but not essentially) the assertions of the primacy. The fourth session established the reasons for which the use of <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a> is lawful, quoting from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> passages about images in the temple (<a href="../bible/exo025.htm#vrs18">Exodus 25:18-22</a>; <a href="../bible/num007.htm#vrs89">Numbers 7:89</a>; <a href="../bible/eze041.htm#vrs18">Ezekiel 41:18-19</a>; <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs5">Hebrews 9:5</a>), and also citing a great number of the Fathers. Euthymius of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardes</a> at the end of the session read a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this sense. In the fifth session Tarasius explained that Iconoclasm came from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; some Iconoclast misquotations were exposed, their books burnt, and an icon set up in the hall in the midst of the fathers. The sixth session was occupied with the Iconoclast synod of 754; its claim to be a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> was denied, because neither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> nor the three other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> had a share in it. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of that synod (see above) was refuted clause by clause. The seventh session drew up the symbol (<em>horos</em>) of the council, in which, after repeating the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> and renewing the condemnation of all manner of former <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, the fathers make their definition. Images are to receive veneration (<em>proskynesis</em>), not adoration (<em>latreia</em>); the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to them is only relative (<em>schetike</em>), for the sake of their prototype (for the text of this, the essential definition of the council, see <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">VENERATION OF IMAGES</a>). <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathemas</a> are pronounced against the Iconoclast leaders; Germanus, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>, and George of Cyprus are praised. In opposition to the formula of the Iconoclast synod the fathers declare: "The Trinity has made these three glorious" (<em>he Trias tous treis edoxasen</em>). A deputation was sent to the empress with the Acts of the synod; a letter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople acquainted them with its decision. Twenty-two canons were drawn up, of which these are the chief: <ul><li>canons 1 and 2 confirm the canons of all former <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>; <li>canon 3 forbids the appointment of <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> by the State; only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may elect other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <li>canons 4 and 5 are against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; <li>canon 6 insists on yearly <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>; <li>canon 7 forbids <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, under penalty of deposition, to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> churches without <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>; <li>canon 10 forbids <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to change their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> without their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> consent; <li>canon 13 commands all <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to be restored; <li>canons 18-20 regulate abuses in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. </ul> An eighth and last session was held on 23 October at Constantinople in the presence of Irene and her son. After a discourse by Tarasius the Acts were read out and signed by all, including the empress and the emperor. The synod was closed with the usual Polychronia or formal acclamation, and Epiphanius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, preached a sermon to the assembled fathers.

<p>Tarasius sent to Pope Adrian an account of all that had happened, and Adrian approved the Acts (letter to Charles the Great) and had them translated into Latin. But the question of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the friendship of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> still caused had feeling between East and West; moreover an Iconoclast party still existed at Constantinople, especially in the army.
<h2 id="section3">The second Iconoclast persecution</h2>

<p>Twenty-seven years after the Synod of Nicaea, Iconoclasm broke out again. Again the holy pictures were destroyed, and their defenders fiercely <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. For twenty-eight years the former story was repeated with wonderful exactness. The places of Leo III, Constantine V, and Leo IV are taken by a new line of Iconoclast emperors &#151; Leo V, Michael II, Theophilus. Pope Paschal I acts just as did <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>, the faithful Patriarch Nicephorus stands for Germanus I, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> lives again in <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore the Studite</a>. Again one synod rejects icons, and another, following it, defends them. Again an empress, regent for her young son, puts an end to the storm and restores the old custom &#151; this time finally.

<p>The origin of this second outbreak is not far to seek. There had remained, especially in the army, a considerable Iconoclast party. Constantine V, their hero had been a valiant and successful general against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, Michael I (811-13), who kept the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a>, was singularly unfortunate in his attempt to defend the empire. The Iconoclasts looked back regretfully to the glorious campaigns of his predecessor, they evolved the amazing conception of Constantine as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, they went in <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to his grave and cried out to him: "Arise come back and save the perishing empire". When Michael I, in June, 813, was utterly defeated by the Bulgars and fled to his capital, the soldiers forced him to resign his crown and set up one of the generals Leo the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> (Leo V, 813-20) in his place. An officer (Theodotus Cassiteras) and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (the Abbot John Grammaticus) persuaded the new emperor that all the misfortunes of the empire were a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of image-worship. Leo, once persuaded, used all his power to put down the icons, and so all the trouble began again.

<p>In 814 the Iconoclasts assembled at the palace and prepared an elaborate attack against images, repeating almost exactly the arguments of the synod of 754. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople was Nicephorus I (806-15), who became one of the chief defenders of images in this second <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The emperor invited him to a discussion of the question with the Iconoclasts; he refused since it had been already settled by the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a>. The work of demolishing images began again. The picture of Christ restored by Irene over the iron door of the palace, was again removed. In 815 the patriarch was summoned to the emperor's presence. He came surrounded by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and held a long discussion with Leo and his Iconoclast followers. Inn he same year the emperor summoned a synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who, obeying his orders, deposed the patriarch and elected Theodotus Cassiteras (Theodotus I, 815-21) to succeed him. Nicephorus was banished across the Bosporus. Till his death in 829, he defended the cause of the images by controversial writings (the "Lesser Apology", "Antirrhetikoi", "Greater Apology", etc. in P.G., C, 201-850; Pitra, "Spicileg. Solesm.", I, 302-503; IV, 233, 380), wrote a history of his own time (<em>Historia syntomos</em>, P.G., C, 876-994) and a general chronography from Adam (<em>chronographikon syntomon</em>, in P.G., C, 995-1060). Among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who accompanied Nicephorus to the emperor's presence in 815 was <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studium monastery</a> at Constantinople (d. 826). Throughout this second Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a> (<em>Theodorus Studita</em>) was the leader of the faithful <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the chief defender of the icons. He comforted and encouraged Nicephorus in his resistance to the emperor, was three times banished by the Government, wrote a great number of treatises controversial letters, and apologies in various forms for the images. His chief point is that Iconoclasts are <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since they deny an essential element of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, namely, that it can be represented graphically. This amounts to a denial of its reality and material quality, whereby Iconoclasts revive the old <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Ehrhard judges <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a> to be "perhaps the most ingenious [<em>der scharfsinnigste</em>] of the defenders of the cult of images" (in Krumbacher's "Byz. Litt.", p. 150). In any case his position can be rivalled only by that of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. (See his work in P.G., XCIX; for an account of them see Krumbacher, op. cit., 147-151, 712-715; his life by a contemporary <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, P.G., XCIX, 9 sq.) His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 11 Nov. in the Byzantine Rite, 12 Nov. in the Roman Martyrology.

<p>The first thing the new patriarch Theodotus did was to hold a synod which condemned the council of 787 (the Second Nicene) and declared its adherence to that of 754. Bishops, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and even officers of the Government who would not accept its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> were deposed, banished, tortured. <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore of Studium</a> refused communion with the Iconoclast patriarch, and went into exile. A number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of all ranks were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at this time, and his references; pictures of all kinds were destroyed everywhere. <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore</a> appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Paschal I, 817-824) in the name of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Eastern image-worshippers. At the same time Theodotus the Iconoclast patriarch, sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who were, however not admitted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, since Theodotus was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> intruder in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of which Nicephorus was still lawful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But Paschal received the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> sent by Theodoret and gave up the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Praxedes to them and others who had fled from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the East. In 818 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the emperor with a letter defending the icons and once more refuting the Iconoclast accusation of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. In this letter he insists chiefly on our need of exterior signs for invisible things: <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, words, the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the Cross</a>. and all tangible signs of this kind; how, then, can people who a admit these reject images? (The fragment of this letter that has been preserved is published in Pitra, "Spicileg. Solesm.". II, p. xi sq.). The letter did not have any effect on the emperor; but it is from this time especially that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the East turn with more loyalty than ever to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as their leader, their last refuge in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The well-known texts of <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a> in which he defends the primacy in the strongest possible language &#151; e.g., "Whatever novelty is brought into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by those who wander from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must certainly be referred to Peter or to his successor . . . . Save us, chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (Ep. i, 33, P.G., XCIX, 1018); "Arrange that a decision be received from old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the custom has been handed down from the beginning by the tradition of our fathers" (Ep. ii, 36; ibid., 1331 --were written during this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>).

<p>The protestations of loyalty to old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> made by the Orthodox and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> at the time are her last witness immediately before the Great Schism. There were then two separate parties in the East having no communion with each other: the Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> under the emperor with their anti-patriarch Theodotus, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> led by <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore the Studite</a> acknowledging the lawful patriarch Nicephorus and above him the distant <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who was to them the "chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 820, Leo V ended his tyrannical reign by being <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in a palace revolution that set up one of his generals, Michael II (the Stammerer, 820-29) as emperor. Michael was also an Iconoclast and continued his predecessors policy, though at first he was anxious not to persecute but to conciliate every one. But he changed nothing of the Iconoclast law and when Theodotus the anti-patriarch died (821) he refused to restore Nicephorus and set up another usurper, Antony, formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sylaeum (Antony I, 321-32). In 822 a certain general of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> race, Thomas, set up a dangerous revolution with the help of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. It does not seem that this revolution had anything to do with the question of images. Thomas represented rather the party of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> emperor, Leo V. But after it was put down, in 824, Michael became much more severe towards the image-worshippers. A great number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> fled to the West, and Michael wrote a famous letter full of bitter accusations of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> to his rival Louis the Pious (814-20) to persuade him to hand over these exiles to Byzantine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (in Manse, XIV, 417-22). Other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had not escaped were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and tortured, among whom were <a href="../cathen/09242a.htm">Methodius of Syracuse</a> and Euthymius, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardes</a>. The deaths of <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore the Studite</a> (11 Nov., 826) and of the lawful patriarch Nicephorus (2 June, 828) were a great loss to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> at this time. Michael's son and successor, Theophilus, (829-42), continued the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> still more fiercely. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Lazarus, was scourged till he nearly died; another <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Methodius, was shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> with common ruffians for seven years; Michael, Syncellus of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and Joseph, a famous writer of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, were tortured. The two brothers <a href="../cathen/14577a.htm">Theophanes and Theodore</a> were scourged with 200 strokes and branded in the face with hot irons as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> (Martyrol. Rom., 27 December). By this time all images had been removed from the churches and public places, the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> were filled with their defenders, the faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were reduced to a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> hiding about the empire, and a crowd of exiles in the West. But the emperor's wife Theodora and her mother Theoctista were faithful to the Second Nicene Synod and waited for better times.

<p>Those times came as soon as Theophilus died (20 January, 842). He left a son, three years old, Michael III (the Drunkard, who lived to cause the Great Schism of Photius, 842-67), and the regent was Michael's mother, Theodora. Like Irene at the end of the first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, Theodora at once began to change the situation. She opened the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, let out the confessors who were shut up for defending images, and recalled the exiles. For a time she hesitated to revoke the Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> but soon she made up her mind and everything was brought back to the conditions of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicea</a>. The patriarch John VII (832-42), who had succeeded Antony I, was given his choice between restoring the images and retiring. He preferred to retire. and his place was taken by Methodius, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who had already suffered years of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for the cause of the icons (Methodius I, 842-46). In the same year (842) a synod at Constantinople approved of John VII's deposition, renewed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a> and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Iconoclasts. This is the last act in the story of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. On the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (19 February, 842) the icons were brought back to the churches in solemn procession. That day (the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>) was made into a perpetual memory of the triumph of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> at the end of the long Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. It is the "Feast of Orthodoxy" of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> still kept very solemnly by both Uniats and Orthodox. Twenty years later the Great Schism began. So large has this, the last of the old <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, loomed in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christians</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> looks upon it as a kind of type of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in general the Feast of Orthodoxy, founded to commemorate the defeat of Iconoclasm has become a feast of the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. It is in this sense that it is now kept. The great <em>Synodikon</em> read out on that day <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> rebels and nihilists also) among whom the Iconoclasts appear only as one fraction of a large and varied class. After the restoration of the icons in 842, there still remained an Iconoclast party in the East, but it never again got the ear of an emperor, and so gradually dwindled and eventually died out.
<h2 id="section4">Iconoclasm in the west</h2>

<p>There was an echo of these troubles in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, chiefly through misunderstanding of the meaning of Greek expressions used by the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a>. As early as 767 Constantine V had tried to secure the sympathy of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for his campaign against images this time without success. A synod at Gentilly sent a declaration to <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Pope Paul I</a> (757-67) which quite satisfied him. The trouble began when <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> (772-95) sent a very imperfect translation of the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a> to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charles the Great</a> (<a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, 768-814). The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of this Latin version are obvious from the quotations made from it by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For instance in the third session of the council Constantine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> had said: "I receive the holy and venerable images; and I give worship which is according to real adoration [<em>kata latreian</em>] only to the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> and life-giving Trinity" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XII, 1148). This phrase had been translated: "I receive the holy and venerable images with the adoration which I give to the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> and life-giving Trinity" ("Libri Carolini", III, 17, P.L. XCVIII, 1148). There were other reasons why these <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> objected to the decrees of the council. Their people had only just been converted from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and so they were suspicious of anything that might seem like a return to it. Germans <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of Byzantine elaborate forms of respect; prostrations, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kisses</a>, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and such signs that Greeks used constantly towards their emperors, even towards the emperor's <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and therefore applied naturally to holy pictures, seemed to these <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> servile, degrading, even <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> say the word <em>proskynesis</em> (which meant worship only in the sense of reverence and veneration) translated <em>adoratio</em> and understood it as meaning the homage due only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Lastly, there was their indignation against the political conduct of the Empress Irene, the state of friction that led to the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the establishment of a rival empire. Suspicion of everything done by the Greeks, dislike of all their customs, led to the rejection of the council did not mean that the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> sided with the Iconoclasts. If they refused to accept the Nicene Council they equally rejected the Iconoclast synod of 754. They had <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a> and kept them: but they thought that the Fathers of Nicaea had gone too far, had encouraged what would be real <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p>The answer to the decrees of the second Council of Nicaea sent in this faulty translation by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> was a refutation in eighty-five chapters brought to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 790 by a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Angilbert. This refutation, later expanded and fortified with quotations from the fathers and other arguments became the famous "Libri Carolini" or "Capitulare de Imaginibus" in which <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> is represented as declaring his convictions (first published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by Jean du Tillet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St-Brieux, 1549, in P.L. XCVIII, 990-1248). The authenticity of this work, some time disputed, is now established. In it the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reject the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> both of 787 and of 754. They admit that pictures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should be kept as ornaments in churches and as well as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> themselves should receive a certain proper veneration (<em>opportuna veneratio</em>); but they declare that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only can receive adoration (meaning <em>adoratio, proskynesis</em>); pictures are in themselves indifferent, have no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connexion with the Faith, are in any case inferior to <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, the Cross, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in 794, answered these eighty-five chapters by a long exposition and defence of the cult of images (Hadriani ep. ad Carol. Reg." P.L., XCVIII, 1247-92), in which he mentions, among other points, that twelve <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present at, and had agreed to, the Roman synod of 731. Before the letter arrived the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; held the synod of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (794) in the presence of two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, Theophylactus and Stephen, who do not seem to have done anything to clear up the misunderstanding. This Synod formally condemns the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicea</a>, showing, at the same time, that it altogether misunderstands the decision of Nicaea. The essence of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> is its second canon: "A question has been brought forward concerning the next synod of the Greeks which they held at Constantinople [the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where the synod they condemn was held] in connexion with the adoration of images, in which synod it was written that those who do not give service and adoration to pictures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> just as much as to the Divine Trinity are to be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. But our most holy Fathers whose names are above, refusing this adoration and serve despise and condemn that synod." <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> sent these Acts to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and demanded the condemnation of Irene and Constantine VI. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of course refused to do so, and matters remained for a time as they were, the second Council of Nicaea being rejected in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom.

<p>During the second iconoclastic <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in 824, the Emperor Michael II wrote to Louis the Pious the letter which, besides demanding that the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had escaped to the West should be handed over to him, entered into the whole question of image-worship at length and contained vehement accusations against its defenders. Part of the letter is quoted in Leclercq-Hefele, "Histoire des conciles", III, 1, p. 612. Louis begged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/05598b.htm">Eugene II</a>, 824-27) to receive a document to be drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in which texts of the Fathers bearing on the subject should be collected. Eugene agreed, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met in 825 at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This meeting followed the example of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> exactly. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> try to propose a middle way, but decidedly lean toward the Iconoclasts. They produce some texts against these, many more against image-worship. Pictures may be tolerated only as mere ornaments. <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> is blamed for his assent to Nicaea II. Two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Jeremias of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> and Jonas of Orl&eacute;ns, are sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with this document; they are especially warned to treat the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with every possible reverence and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and to efface any passages that might offend him. Louis, also, wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, protesting that he only proposed to help him with some useful quotations in his discussions with the Byzantine Court; that he had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of dictating to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, 1. c.). Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Eugene's answer or of the further developments of this incident. The correspondence about images continued for some time between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church; gradually the decrees of the second Council of Nicaea were accepted throughout the Western Empire. <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> (872-82) sent a better translation of the Acts of the council which helped very much to remove misunderstanding.

<p>There are a few more isolated cases of Iconoclasm in the West. Claudius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (d. 840), in 824 destroyed all pictures and crosses in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> forbade <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, recourse to intercession of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, veneration of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, even lighted candles, except for practical purposes. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire and a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Theodomir, wrote against him (P.L. CV); he was condemned by a local synod. Agobard of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> at the same time thought that no external signs of reverence should be paid to images; but he had few followers. Walafrid Strabo ("De. eccles. rerum exordiis et incrementis" in P.L., CXIV, 916-66) and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> ("Opusc. c. Hincmarum Lauden.", xx, in P.L. CXXVI) defended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practice and contributed to put an end to the exceptional principles of <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But as late as the eleventh century Bishop Jocelin of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> still had Iconoclast <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> for which he was severely reprimanded by <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>.
