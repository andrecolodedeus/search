<h1>Ignatius Knoblecher</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary in Central Africa, born 6 July, 1819, at St. Cantian in Lower Carniola; died 13 April, 1858, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He studied at the gymnasium of Rudolfswerth, at the lyceum and the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 9 March, 1845, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and a year later was graduated at <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> as doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. When the Vicariate Apostolic for Central Africa was erected on 3 April, 1846, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> selected Knoblecher as one of the missionaries for that country. Before leaving for Central Africa he spent eight months on the Lebanon and at other places in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> to acquaint himself with the rites and customs of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a>. Towards the end of September, 1847, he left Cairo in company of Maximilian Ryllo, S.J., the Pro- <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Central Africa, and four other missionaries, and arrived at Khartoum on 11 February, 1848. Here they erected a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for young <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> whom they had purchased in the slave-market and who subsequently assisted them on their missions. Through them Knoblecher became acquainted with the languages spoken in the interior of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and was soon enabled to compile a sort of dictionary of these languages. When Father Ryllo died, on 17 June, 1845, Knoblecher succeeded him as pro-vicar Apostolic. From Khartoum Knoblecher made an expedition into the interior of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> in the fall of 1849. He ascended the Bahr-el-Abiad (White Nile) and was the first white man to penetrate into the land of the <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> tribe as far as 4 degrees 10 minutes north latitude. In 1850 he went back to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to recruit missionaries and collect money for the African missions. He returned to Africa in 1852 with five new missionaries, erected a mission among the <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> tribe at Gondokoro, and in 1854 another among the Denka or Jangeh tribe at Angweyn (Heiligenkreuz). The missionaries were hampered in their apostolic labours by <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> merchants and slave-traders, to whose interest it was to keep the tribes of Central Africa in a state of savagery and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. The deadly climate also cut short the lives of many missionaries, and Knoblecher himself died while making a journey to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to regain his health. Valuable accounts of his travels in Central Africa were published in "Jahresberichte des Marienvereins" (Vienna, 1852-58). His large ethnographical and ornithological collections are preserved in the cabinets of natural curiosities at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a>, and the studies which he prepared on the Denka and <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> languages are to be seen in the Imperial Library of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.
