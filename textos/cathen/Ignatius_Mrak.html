<h1>Ignatius Mrak</h1>  

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette, U.S.A.</a>, born 16 October, 1818, in Hotovle, in the <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Diocese of Laibach</a> (Carinthia), <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, 2 Jan., 1901. He made his classical studies in the gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a> and his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the local <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. On 13 August, 1837, Prince-Bishop Anton Aloys Wolf raised him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. To qualify for a tutorship in the house of Field-Marshal Baron Peter Pirquet, the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> passed a rigorous state examination, and sojourned two years at Legnago near <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, then an Austrian possession. In 1840 he returned to his native diocese, and occupied several positions as assistant before emigrating to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> five years later. Bishop Lefebre of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> received him cordially, and sent him immediately to Arbre Croche to assist the celebrated Indian missionary, Father Francis Pierz. For two years the missionaries worked fruitfully together, and, when in 1851 Pierz removed to <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, Mrak retained charge of the Indian mission. For his devotion to the red race <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Baraga</a> appointed him his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and upon the death of <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Baraga</a> he was created second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>. For a long time he refused to accept, but, finally yielding to the urgency of <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> on 9 February, 1869. After ten years' devotion to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, although he was not unaccustomed to hardships, his health began to fail, and he was permitted to resign in 1879, and was made <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01564a.htm">Antinoe</a>. For some years he remained with his successor, <a href="../cathen/15377b.htm">Bishop Vertin</a>, and, when necessity required, performed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of an ordinary <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. With the return of his health, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Indians awoke, and he returned to the Indian missions, which he had left so reluctantly to accept the episcopate. Bishop Richter of <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a> most cordially welcomed him, and at his own request gave him the Indian mission at Eagle Town, Leeland County. Here he lived a simple life sharing his small annuity of eight hundred dollars with the two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters whom he had induced to open a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for his charges. In his eighty-first year he retired to <a href="../cathen/09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, and filled thenceforth a chaplaincy at St. Mary's Hospital to the last day of his life. His charity was as proverbial as his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. He outlived his successor in the episcopate, and saw the election of the fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whom he himself had raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. His body rests in the vault under the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> beside those of his predecessors, <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Baraga</a> and <a href="../cathen/15377b.htm">Vertin</a>.
