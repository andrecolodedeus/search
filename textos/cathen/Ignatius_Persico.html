<h1>Ignatius Persico</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born 30 Jan., 1823, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; died 7 Dec., 1896. He entered the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Franciscan Order</a> on 25 April, 1839. Immediately after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was sent in November, 1846, to Patna, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Anastasius Hartmann, made him his <em>socius</em> and confidant. In 1850 Persico accompanied Bishop Hartmann to <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, when he was transferred to that vicariate, and assisted him in founding a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and establishing the "Bombay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Examiner". At the time of the Goanese <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in 1853, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent Persico to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to lay the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> case before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government. He obtained British recognition for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>.

<p>He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 8 March, 1854, and nominated bishop-auxiliary to Bishop Hartmann; but the next year he was appointed visitor of the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of that district. During the Indian Mutiny he was several times in danger of his life. The anxieties of this period told upon his health and in 1860 he was compelled to return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Sent in 1866 on a mission to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, he took part in the Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. On 20 March, 1870, he was nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>; but his health again failing, he resigned in 1873. In 1874 he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; and in 1877 he was commissioned to settle the affairs of the Malabar <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. On 26 March, 1879, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01662b.htm">Aquino</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; but in March, 1887, he was promoted to the titular Archbishopric of Tamiatha and sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to report upon the relations of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> with the political movement. He quickly saw that the question must be considered not merely in relation to present politics but also in relation to the past history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and he delayed his final report in order to consider the question in this broader aspect. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> issued its condemnation of the Plan of Campaign. Persico returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> much disappointed. He was at once nominated Vicar of the Vatican Chapter. On 16 January, 1893, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal priest</a> of the title of St. Peter in Chains.
