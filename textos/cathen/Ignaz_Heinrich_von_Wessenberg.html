<h1>Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> and Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, 4 November, 1774; died at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, 9 August, 1860. He studied at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Dillingen, Wurzburg, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. At the age of eighteen he was already canon at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and Basle, and in 1802, when still a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, he became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Prince-Primate Dalberg for the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>. Not until 1812, when he was thirty-eight years old, did he accept <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders. Wessenberg was entirely unfit for the position. Though a man of extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he was not a profound scholar and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training was very deficient. Imbued from his early youth with Josephinistic and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronian</a> principles, he advocated a German National Church, somewhat loosely connected with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, supported by the State and protected by it against <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> interference.

<p>Before he became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> he had ventilated his liberalistic views of religion and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in a work entitled "Der Geist des Zeitalters" (Zurich, 1801). In 1802 he founded the monthly review "Geistliche Monatsschrift", which he edited and used as a medium to spread his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> religious enlightenment. The protests against this review were such that Dalberg ordered its suspension on 25 May, 1804. It was replaced by the "Konstanzer Pastoralarchiv", which was less offensive and continued to be published annually in two volumes till 1827. For the realization of his pet plans of a National German Church Wessenberg made futile efforts at the council which <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> convened in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1811 and at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1815.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> portion of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> Wessenberg's innovations aroused great dissatisfaction. His abolition of various holy days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in the cantons of Aargau and St. Gall in 1806; his cooperation with the Government of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10453a.htm">suppression of monasteries</a>; his orders in case of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> (1808) to permit the male offspring to be brought up in the religion of the father, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> in the religion of the mother; and especially his many matrimonial and other <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> that exceeded his competence induced Testiferrata, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, to call him to account, but Wessenberg insisted that nothing had been done which exceeded the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, giving Testiferrata at the same time to understand that he did not recognize the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>. After various requests from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> put an end to Wessenberg's reformatory plans in that part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by severing the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> cantons from the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 21 October, 1814. On 2 November of the same year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered Dalberg to depose Wessenberg without delay from the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Dalberg kept the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> order secret, though in the beginning of 1815 he temporarily replaced Wessenberg as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by Canon von Roll for private reasons. In the summer of 1815 he requested the Government of Baden to appoint Wessenberg his coadjutor with the right of succession. The government acceded to Dalberg's wish, but <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused to recognize the coadjutorship. In the same year Wessenberg published anonymously a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> anti-papal treatise entitled "Die deutsche Kirche, Ein Vorschlag zu ihrer neuen Begrundung und Einrichtung". It is a plea for his scheme of a German National Church, and suggests detailed plans as to its organization. On 17 Feb., 1817, seven days after the death of Dalberg, the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> elected Wessenberg as vicar of the chapter and administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but his election was invalidated by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 15 March, 1817. In July Wessenberg went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, hoping to gain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to his side and return as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of his projected German Church or, at least, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. He was kindly received by <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, the secretary of state, but was told that, before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would enter into any negotiations with him, he would have to resign as administrator and, like <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, make a declaration to the effect that he disapproved all that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> disapproves. Refusing to submit to these conditions, he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and with the approval of the Government of Baden continued to act as administrator of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> until 1827, in open disobedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> suppressed the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Provida sollersque", of 16 Aug., 1821, incorporating it in the newly erected <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Archdiocese of Freiburg</a>, whose first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Bernard Boll, was appointed in 1827. It must be said to the credit of Wessenberg that during his administration he rendered some services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among these are especially noteworthy his deep solicitude for a better training and stricter discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and his insistence on regular Sunday sermons in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and semi-weekly religious instructions in the state <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. After his retirement in 1827 he gave vent to his anti- <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sentiments and spread his <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> views on religion and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by various treatises and by frequent contributions to the anti-religious review, "Die freim&uuml;thigen Bl&auml;tter" (Constance, 1830-44). His chief literary productions are: "Die grossen Kirchenversammlungen des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts in Beziehung auf Kirchenverbesserung" (4 vols., Constance, 1840, 2nd ed., 1845), extremely anti-papal (cf. Hefele, in "T&uuml;binger Quartalschrift", 1841, 616 sq.); "Die Stellung des r&ouml;mischen Stuhles gegenuber dem Geiste des 19. Jahrhunderts" (Z&uuml;rich, 1833); "Die Bisthumssynode und die Erfordernisse und Bedingungen einer heilsamen Herstellung derselben" (Freiburg, 1849). The last-named two works were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>. He is also the author of a collection of poems (7 vols., Stuttgart, 1843-54).
