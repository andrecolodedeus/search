<h1>Ignazio Danti</h1>  

<p>Mathematician and cosmographer, b. at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1537; d. at <a href="../cathen/01251a.htm">Alatri</a>, 19 Oct., 1586. As a boy he learned the rudiments of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and architecture from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and aunt, but mathematics and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> were his favorite studies. He received the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> habit 7 March, 1555, changing his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> Pellegrino to Ignazio. After completing his philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> he gave some time to preaching, but soon devoted himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and geography. About 1567 he was invited to Florence by Cosmo I, Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, who wished to avail himself of his services in reviving mathematical and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> studies in his newly acquired dominion. About the same time <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a>, who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>, is said to have commissioned him to furnish plans for the construction of a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Bosco. During his stay in Florence Danti taught mathematics with much success and may be said to have prepared the way for <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> and his contemporaries. He resided at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sta Maria Novella, and designed the first gnomon on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of its church in 1572. He was chosen to direct the building of a canal which was to place Florence in communication with both the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. Cosmo did not live to carry out his project and shortly after his death (1574) Danti became professor of mathematics at the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>. While occupying this chair he spent some time in his native city, at the invitation of the governor, where he prepared maps of the Perugian republic.

<p>On account of his mathematical attainments <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> invited him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, appointed him pontifical mathematician and made him a member of the commission for the reform of the calendar. He also placed him in charge of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> whom he had summoned to the Vatican to continue the work so brilliantly begun by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> during the reign of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and at the same time desired him to make a number of maps of ancient and modern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. When the pontiff commissioned the architect Fontana to repair the Claudian harbour it was Danti who furnished the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> plans. While at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Danti published a translation of a portion of Euclid with annotations and wrote a life of the architect <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a>, preparing also notes for the latter's work on perspective. In recognition of his labours <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a>, in 1583, made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01251a.htm">Alatri</a> in the Campagna. Danti showed himself a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in his new office. He convoked a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, corrected many abuses, and showed great solicitude for the poor. Shortly before his death <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> summoned him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist in the erection of the grand obelisk in the piazza of the Vatican. Besides the works already mentioned, Danti was the author of "Trattato del'uso e della fabbrica dell'astrolabo con la giunta del planifero del Raja"; "Le Scienze matematiche ridotte in tavole", also a revised and annotated edition of "La Sfera di Messer G. Sacrobosco tradotta da Pier Vincenzio Danti".
