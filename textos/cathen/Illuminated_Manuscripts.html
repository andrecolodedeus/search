<h1>Illuminated Manuscripts</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Origin</h2>

<p>A large number of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are covered with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> ornaments which may be presented under several forms: <ul> <li>initials of chapters or paragraphs, ornamented sometimes very simply, sometimes on the other hand with a great profusion of interlacings, foliage, and flowers; these are developed along the whole length of the page and within are sometimes depicted <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or scenes from everyday life; <li>paintings on the margin, in which some scene is carried over several pages; <li>borders around the text (interlacing <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a>, etc.), the most remarkable example is that of the evangelistic canons of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; <li>full-page <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> (or such as cover only a part of the page), but forming real pictures, similar to frescoes or easel pictures; these are chiefly found on very ancient or very recent <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (fourteenth and fifteenth centuries); <li>finally, there exist rolls of parchment wholly covered with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> (Roll of Josue in the Vatican; Exultet Roll of S. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; see below). </ul> All these ornaments are called "eluminures", illuminations, or miniatures, a world used since the end of the sixteenth century. At first the "miniator" was charged with tracing in red minium the titles and initials. Despite its limitations, the art of illumination is one of the most charming ever invented; it exacts the same qualifications and produced almost as powerful effects as <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>; it even calls for a delicacy of touch all its own. And whereas most of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> have perished, these little works form an almost uninterrupted series which afford us a clear <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the chief <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of each epoch and each region. Finally, in the history of art the r&ocirc;le of illuminated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was considerable; by treating in their works scenes of sacred history the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> inspired other artists, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, goldsmiths, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> workers, etc.; it is especially in miniature that the ebb and flow of artistic styles during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> may be detected.

<p>In the Orient must be sought the origin of this art, as well as that of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> themselves. The most ancient examples are found on <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> papyri, where in the midst of the texts, and not separated from it, portraits are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, most frequently in profile, according to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> method. After having drawn the outline in black in the artist filled in the drawing in colours. The art seems to have been also cultivated by the Greek artists of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. The papyrus containing the poems of Timotheus (fourth century B.C.) found at Abousir, has a long-legged bird in the body of the text as a mark of division. A fragment of a romance on a papyrus (Paris, Bib. Nat., supp. Gr. 1294; first century A.D.) displays a text broken by groups of miniatures: men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in bluish-gray or pink costumes stand out in relief from the background of the papyrus itself. Latin writers show us that the miniature was introduced into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as early as the first century B.C. (Pliny, "Hist. Nat.", XXV, 8). Martial (XIV, 1865) mentions a portrait of Virgil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on a parchment <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, and Varro collected seven hundred such portraits of illustrious men. (The portraits of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> result from this tradition.) None of these works remains and the only traces of the illuminations of antiquity are found in the following <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the fourth and fifth centuries: <ul><li>the "Virgil" of the Vatican (Lat. 3225), written by a single hand, has fifty miniatures which appear to be the work of at least three different <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. These are small pictures bordered by coloured bands (six of them fill a whole page); some of them, especially in the "Georgics", represent country landscapes the freshness of which is worthy of the text they illustrate. The background of buildings and <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> recalls the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> at Pompeii; <li>the "Iliad" of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (similar technic); <li>the Bible of Quedlinburg (Berlin), containing the most ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> miniatures known; <li>the "Calendar" of Philocalus, composed in 354, the original of which, acquired by Peiresc, has disappeared, but the copies at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and the Barberini Library evidence a work of a purity thoroughly antique; the most curious portion is an illustrated calendar in which each month is symbolized by a scene of country life; this is a species of illustration of ancient origin which recurs very frequently in the miniatures of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.</ul>
<h2 id="section2">Eastern miniatures</h2>
<h3>Egypt</h3>

<p>The tradition of miniatures on papyrus was preserved till the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. On a Berlin papyrus (Emperor Frederick Museum) we find a picture of Christ curing a demoniac. In the Goleniscev collection there are sixteen leaves of a universal Coptic chronicle on papyrus, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 392 and decorated with miniatures in a very barbarous style, intended as illustrations of the text. In the margin are seen successively the months (women <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with flowers), the provinces of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> (fortified gateways), the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the kings of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Lydia, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, Roman emperors, and perhaps the Patriarch Tehophilus presiding at the destruction of the Serapeum. The author was a native <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and a complete stranger to Hellenic art.
<h3>Syria and Mesopotamia</h3>

<p>The existence of Persian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> on parchment very rich in miniatures, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by allusions of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/140613.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XIII.6, 18</a>). As early as the fifth century <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of miniaturists were formed in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Mesopotamia which drew some of their inspiration from Greek art (draped figures), but relied mainly on the ornamental traditions of the ancient Orient. The masterpiece of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is the Syriac Evangeliary written in 586 at the Monastery of Zagba (Mesopotamia) by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Rabula (since the fifteenth century in the Laurentian Library, Florence). The miniatures are real pictures with a decorative frame formed of zigzags, curves, rainbows, etc. The Gospel canons are set in arcades ornamented with flowers and birds. The scene of the Crucifixion is treated with an abundance of detail which is very rare at this period. The works of the Syro-Mesopotamian School seem to have missed the meaning of the Hellenic figures (figures in flowing draperies) of which they retained the tradition. On a Syriac evangeliary in the Borgian Museum (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> Syr., 14, f, k.) men and animals are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in unreal colours and are bordered with black lines which give to the illuminations the appearance of cloisonn&eacute; enamels. The work, which is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1546, seems to have been inspired by an older model.


<h3>Armenia</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> School of illuminating also belongs to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. It is represented by the evangeliary of Etschmiadzin (tenth century), the miniatures of which are derived from a sixth-century model; the evangeliary of Queen Mlke (Venice, Monastery of the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 902), and the evangeliary of T&uuml;bingen, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1113. In all these works the richness of the framework and the hieratic character of the human face are noteworthy.
<h3>Muslim art</h3>

<p>All the above characteristics carried to extremes are found in the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslim</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of miniatures (Arabic, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, and Persian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>); the oldest date only from the thirteenth century. Together with copies of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, admirably illuminated with purely geometrical figures radiating symmetrically around a central <em>motif</em> like the design of a carpet, there is found especially in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, a fruitful <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> which did not fear to depict the human face. Nothing is more picturesque than the varied scenes intended to illustrate the books of chronicles, legends, etc. Besides fantastic scenes ("Apocalypse of Mohomet", Paris, Bib. Nat., supp. Turk., 190) are found contemporary reproductions of scenes from real life which take us into the streets of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a> in the thirteenth century or permit us to follow an army or a caravan on the march ("Maq&acirc;m&acirc;t" of Hariri, Bib. Nat., Paris, supp. <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a>., 1618). Eastern artists, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslim</a>, frequently portray their subjects on backgrounds of gold; in Persian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, however, are found attempts at landscape backgrounds, several of which betray a Chinese influence.
<h2 id="section3">Byzantine miniatures</h2>

<p>The history of Byzantine miniatures is yet to be written; it is impossible at present to determine its origin or to study its development. It seems more and more evident that Byzantine art, far from being an original creation, is no more than a prolonged survival of the Hellenic-oriental art of the fourth to the sixth centuries. The Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> charged with the illumination of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> never ceased to copy models, following the fashion and the occupation of the time, these models sometimes varies; hence Byzantine art has undergone a development more apparent than real. Under present conditions, without seeking to determine the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, we must be content to indicate the principal groups of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.
<h3>Fifth and sixth centuries</h3>

<p>Several of the Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in gold letters on purple parchment have been rightly compared with one another, viz. the Genesis of the Imperial Library of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, the Evangeliarium of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, and the fragment of the Gospel of St. Matthew discovered at <a href="../cathen/14014b.htm">Sinope</a> (since 1900 in the Bib. Nat., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>). In these three <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> has an anecdotic character; it is intended to illustrate the text, and sometimes two periods of a scene are represented in a picture. Both the evangelaries show a <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a> face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, majestic and severe, which already suggests the "Pantocrator" of church <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>. From the same period date two works which appear to be the transcription on parchment of an original on papyrus; one is the Roll of Josue in the Vatican Library, which displays a series of miniatures, eleven yards long, relating to the history of Josue; the other is the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the voyage of <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a> (Vatican), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Sinai; in this, together with symbolic representations of various parts of the world, are many scenes and personages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> opposite the text, with the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> itself as background. Very different is the illustration of medical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> such as the "Dioscorides" of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, executed about the year 500, for Juliana, daughter of Placidia. Heron are found real pictures copied from ancient originals (portraits of physicians and of Juliana).
<h3>Eighth to eleventh century</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic crisis</a> was fatal to illumination and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were either mutilated or destroyed. An attempt was made to substitute for religious representations a purely ornamental art. Probably to this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> belongs an evangeliary of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (Bib. Nat., Gr. 63), in which the <em>motifs</em> of decoration are borrowed from flora and fauna. The triumph of images in the eleventh century was also the triumph of religious miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, which together with calligraphy underwent great development in the scriptorium of <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studion</a>. One of the books illustrated by preference by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> comprise two elements: the scenes of the history of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and the symbolic allusions to the life of Christ contained in the Psalms. There are to be distinguished (1) the aristocratic psalter, represented by the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (Gr. 139); the miniatures extend over the whole page within a rich border, and appear to be the reproduction from an ancient original of the third-fourth century; some pictures, such as that of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> tending his flocks, have a quite Pompeian freshness. Antique influence makes itself felt by a large number of allegories personified and draped in Hellenic costumes; (2) the monastic and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> psalter in which the miniatures placed in the margin follow the text step by step. The Chloudov <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (ninth cent.), those of Vatopedi (tenth cent.), the Vatican (Barberini Library: <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1059), etc. are the principal specimens of this class. Some miniatures of the Chloudov <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> represent episodes of the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic conflict</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> often illustrated at this period was the "Menologion", which contained sometimes besides the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> calendar, and abbreviation of the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> for each day. The most celebrated is that of the Vatican, decorated for Basil II (976-1025) by seven artists who left their names attached to each miniature. A great variety of colours relieved a rather extreme monotony of inspiration; everywhere are found the same <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> backgrounds, the same sufferings in the midst of the same landscapes. The beautiful <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the "Homilies" of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazienzus</a> (Paris, Bib. Nat., Gr. 510: end of ninth century) was composed for Basil II; it is unfortunately damaged but it presents a remarkable series of the most varied pictures (portraits of St. Gregory of Nazienzus and of Basil I; sessions of Councils; Biblical scenes, etc.). This period was decidedly the golden age of Byzantine illumination. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, even those which lack pictures, have at least ornamented initial letters, which in the earlier examples are very simple, but in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> became surrounded with foliage, in the midst of which animals or small figures disported themselves. (These initials, however, never attained the same dimensions as in Western <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.).
<h3>Twelfth century</h3>

<p>The lofty traditions of Byzantine miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> were upheld until the fall of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> in 1204. A group of the Octateuch (Smyrna, <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>, Vatican and Seraglio <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>) seems to have the same origin. The artists were chiefly concerned with illustrating the text, following it step by step; some of the scenes are spirited and picturesque, but the inspiration seems derived from ancient models (such as the Roll of Josue). The specimen at the Seraglio was composed for Prince Isaac, some of Alexius I Comnenus. A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> whose picture exercised great influence on Byzantine art is that of the "Homilies on the Virgin", by James, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Coxynobaphos (Vatical 1162; Paris, 1208). The initials are remarkable for richness, and the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> develop all the events of the life of the Blessed Virgin until the birth of Christ (cf. the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> of the Kahri&eacute;-Djami at Constantinople).
<h3>Thirteenth to fifteenth century</h3>

<p>The studios of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> for a long time felt the effects of the catastrophe of 1204, and after the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> ceased to illuminate luxuriously <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. One of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> most characteristic of this period is that of the "Chronicle" of Skylitzes (Madrid, National Library, thirteenth century). The colours are clear in tone and very fresh, but the artist having no ancient model before him and left to his own resources, has executed veritable <em>bons-hommes</em>, which nevertheless charm by the vivacity of their movements and their picturesque attitudes. The imitation of antiquity however was not abandoned, as is shown by the portraits of Dosiades and of Theocritus (Cod. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Gr. 28- 32) composed in the fourteenth century, but probably copied from Alexandrian originals of the third and fourth centuries. lastly attention is called to certain fourteenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Western or even Italian inspiration (Cod. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Gr. 135; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1362; on this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, written by a scribe of John V Cantacuzenus, there is a Gothic monster, a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> with buckler ornamented with fleur-de-lis, etc.). In the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> countries, the illuminated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a>, Russian or Serbian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> belong to the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but have also been directly influenced by the Orient, especially by <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Some Russian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were illuminated in the sixteenth century (e.g. the Book of the Tsars, 1535-53). Scandinavian influences appear in Russian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (monsters and interlacings of initials); and one of the most remarkable monuments of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is the Servian <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are executed by an impressionistic artist, who uses contrasting colours instead of pen designs.
<h2 id="section4">Western miniatures</h2>

<p>The evolution of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the Occident was quite different; the imitation of ancient models was never as complete as in the Orient, and as in all other arts, the time came when the illuminator of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> abandoned tradition and attempted to copy nature. In the Occident even more than in the Orient, it is possible to follow a real development of illuminated books.
<h3>Sixth to eighth century</h3>

<p>Until the Carolingian epoch the sole original <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of illumination is to be sought in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, or in those founded on the Continent by <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The works of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> are characterized by wonderful decorative sense, far removed from <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>. Nothing is more graceful than the large initials formed by ribbons ornamented with interlacings, in the midst of which are sometimes human heads or animals. Some borders decorated with spirals, rose-work, and interlacings recall, by their display of fancy, pages of the illuminated <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Korans</a>. Indeed there are in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> art elements which are frankly Oriental, and the geometrical and symmetrical aspect of the human form in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> may be compared to what we find on certain Coptic monuments, buildings, or <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> as in the Orient, ancient ornamentation finds little place; foliage is entirely absent from this decoration, which consists almost exclusively of geometrical elements. The kinship of these <em>motifs</em> with those found on the barbaric jewels or the stone <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is evident. Among the most celebrated works of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> may be cited: the "Book of Kells" (Trinity College, Dublin), the transcription of which is ascribed to St. Columba, but which in reality belongs to the seventh century; the "Evangeliarum of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>", belonging to the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> (British Museum, Cotton <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, Nero D. IV), copied in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> by Bishop Eadfrith (698-721), bound by Bishop &AElig;thilwald, and ornamented with precious stones by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Billfrith, is also of great value. Although copied in an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> it possesses all the characteristics of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> art; large initials decorated with interlacings and without foliage, the predominance of simple colours (violet, green, yellow, red) absence of gold and silver, portraits of the evangelists similar to those on Byzantine <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Beginning with the sixth century this art of illumination was brought by <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, not only to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> but also to the Continent, where the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Luxeuil, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, St. Gall, and Bobbio became centres of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> art. As specimens of this expansion may be cited: the "Evangeliarium of St. Willibrord" (d. 730), Apostle of the Frisians (Cod. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, supp. Lat. 693), of which the initials resemble those of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>; the "Evangeliarum of Maeseyck" (Belgium) eighth century; the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> called Codex Bigotianus (Cod. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Lat. 281 and 298), the work of the Abbey of F&eacute;camp, eighth century; the so-called St. Cainim <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (now with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, but originating in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), in reality of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of St. Gall contain miniatures of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but showing foreign influence.

<p>In the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, among the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, there were <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of calligraphy similar to those of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, with more marked traces of ancient art (absence of interlacings which were replaced by garlands, sturdy foliage, etc.). As an example may be mentioned the initial of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> papyri of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, sixth century (Homilies of <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a>). A celebrated Bible, the ornamentation of which remains a problem, must be considered apart. This is the famous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of St. Gatien at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> by Libri about 1846, and returned to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in 1888, after having figured in the Ashburnham collection. This <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, written in seventh-century uncials, is adorned with large full-page miniatures framed in red bands and presenting a number of scenes arranged on different margins, but without symmetry. What is striking about the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is its aim at picturesqueness and movement, and the wholly Oriental character of the design and especially of the costumes of the personages (the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> wear the tall head-dress and veil of the bas- reliefs of <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>) and of the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> backgrounds (bulbous <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a> alternating with pedimented buildings). The arrangement of the scenes recalls certain fourteenth-century Persian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In this instance we have to do perhaps with the reproduction of a cycle of miniatures conceived in the East to illustrate the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>.
<h3>Ninth and tenth centuries</h3>

<p>The Carolingian period was as decisive for the illumination of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> as for other arts. Thanks to the initiative of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and his chief assistants, <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, Theodulfus, etc., <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> were formed in the principal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the empire, and our <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> possess a large number of their works. The elements which compose this art were most varied; the influence of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Anglo-Saxon illuminations is unquestionable, and to it was due the partiality for large initials which until the fifteenth century were one of the favourite ornaments of Western <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Carolingian art was not exclusively <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of this period are found traces of ancient art and Oriental influences (evangeliary canons, symbolical <em>motifs</em> such as the fountain of life, etc.). With the assistance of these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> a whole iconographical cycle may be formed, encyclopedic in character, in which side by side with <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> occur figures from the profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> (liberal arts, <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>, zodiacs, virtues and vices, etc.). Ornamentation is more luxurious, the colours are more vigorous and decided in tone, silver and gold have not been spared and there is even a return to <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in gold letters on a purple ground. Many of these Bibles, <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a>, or Evangeliaries were composed for sovereigns, whose portraits were presented on the first page in all their royal apparel; they are often surrounded by allegorical figures borrowed from antiquity. Beside these full-page <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> we find above all in these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> beautiful initials of extraordinary variety; <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> interlacings alone or combined with antique foliage, purely zoomorphic initials, etc. The principal <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of this period are: the Evangeliary of Godescalc, made for <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, 781-83 (Paris), text in gold letters on purple ground with a decorative framework which is different on each page; Bibles of Theodulf, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (Paris and Le Puy); Evangeliary of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (Vienna); Bibles of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> (Zurich, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, Vallicella, Tours); Bibles of Charles the Bald (Paris); Sacramentary of Drogo (Paris); Sacramentary of Gellone (Paris), has initials uniquely formed with fishes or birds; Evangeliary of Lothaire (Paris); Bible of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> (Paris, tenth cent.); Evangeliary of Cividale (Friuli); Codex Egberti (Trier), presented to Egbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, by two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> in 980. To the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> belong the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> composed in the German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for the Ottos. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> or Anglo-Saxon art also produced remarkable monuments, among which may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> (tenth cent.), the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> (British Museum), and the Benedictionaries of Jumi&egrave;ges (Rouen).
<h3>Tenth to twelfth century</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the eleventh century the fictitious unity in the artistic and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sphere established by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> gave way to the diversity of the provincial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but if the boundaries of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> may almost be traced when there is question of architecture, the task is more difficult in the study of miniatures; researches in this field have scarcely commenced. The illuminated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of this period were made in the monastic studios. As a general thing the writers were at once <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> and calligraphers, such as Guillaume de St. Evroult, "Scriptor et librorum illuminator" (Ord. Vital., III, 7). Sometimes however the two professions were distinct; the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (Valenciennes, 178) bears the inscription "Segharus me scripsit" and on the frontispiece "Sawalo me fecit". Sawalo, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Amand, is the illuminator and his name is found elsewhere. This period is marked by the extraordinary development of large initials while the full-page miniatures disappeared. Illustrations on several scales are still found in the margin. These initials of the Romantic period follow the traditions of Carolingian illumination, but they are even more complex and the human figure assumes an increasingly important place. Some of them are full-length portraits of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or apostles; in others complete scenes (battles, besieged cities, etc.) are developed in the midst of pillars. The great difference between this and the Carolingian period lies in the appearance of <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> and of anachronism (prophets with pointed shoes, etc.). Lastly there are many points of resemblance between the development of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and that of other arts of design. The short and badly drawn figures were succeeded, at the end of the twelfth century, by more slender portraits which resemble the elongated <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>. Such is the character of the ornamental <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which produced innumerable works in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the Two Sicilies. (Here it is difficult to trace the boundary between Western miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and the Byzantine which made its influence felt in the workrooms of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> and especially in the beautiful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the rolls containing the text of the <a href="../cathen/05730b.htm">"Exultet"</a> of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>.) Also worthy of mention is an attempt of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> to infuse more simplicity into illuminating. A model <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> had been composed at <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, in which gold and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> were replaced by a calligraphic decoration in perfect taste. There is an intimate relation between this severe elegance and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> architecture.
<h3>Thirteenth century</h3>

<p>In the thirteenth century illumination, like calligraphy, ceased to be the specialty of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and about the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> appeared the lay illuminators. The taste for illuminated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> spread more and more, and important studios of illuminators arose, the heads of which often furnished sketches of miniatures to be executed. On the other hand the illuminations took a more and more important place at the expense of the text. The artists were no longer satisfied with ornamented initials, but in a series of medallions arranged like those decorating the <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">windows</a> they developed whole cycles of sacred or profane history. There were then composed "Picture Bibles" made up of a continuous series of miniatures (Bible of Sir Thomas Philipps), or "Sermon Bibles", veritable illustrated <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> summaries, giving for each verse of Scripture the literal, symbolical, and moral interpretations. This immense work, which must have contained 5000 figures, has not reached us complete. A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in 3 vols. of a Sermon Bible is divided between the Bodleian Library, the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the British Museum. The <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of Ingeburg (Mus&eacute;e Cond&eacute; at Chantilly) and that of Sts. Louis and Blanche of Castile (Arsenal Library) belong by their ornamentation to the monastic art of the twelfth century. On the other hand new tendencies appear in the works of the second half of the thirteenth century, e.g. the Evangeliarium of the Sainte-Chapelle (Bib. Nat.), the two <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> of St. Louis (Paris, Bib. Nat., and collection of H. Y. Thompson), the works of profane literature (chansons de geste, etc.). Gothic ornamentation with its wealth of rose and quatrefoil decoration, gables, pinnacles, and foliage often forms the framework for these vignettes. The gold backgrounds are almost always covered with designs, sometimes in relief. Instead of foliage and fantastic animals the human figure holds the predominant place. In miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> as in the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of the thirteenth century may be observed the progress of realism and the exact observation of the living model. These beautiful miniatures of the Books of Hours revive for us with their still admirable colours the costumes of the contemporaries of St. Louis and <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>. Such is the style which henceforth dominates French miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and which speedily spread throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
<h3>Early fourteenth century</h3>

<p>This period is represented chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> illuminator Jean Pucelle, whose name has been discovered on several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.) One of the most beautiful of his works is the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a> (Bib. Nat., Lat. 10483-84), executed in collaboration with Mahiet Ancelet and J. Chevrier. The new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was remarkable for its borders, formed of wonderful garlands of interlaced foliage and flowers, no longer conventional as formerly, but copied from nature. Between the border and the text were represented scenes of everyday life, sometimes of a humorous character, for example a piper playing for dancing peasants, or animals, birds, monkeys, butterflies, dragonflies intermingled, with the foliage, as on the sculptured panels of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of the same period. Traces of Italian inspiration appear in the architecture, which is of a mixed Gothic character. Among the works of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> the "Book of the Miracles of Our Lady" (Seminary of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>) is one of the most exquisite. During the same period the English miniaturists produced remarkable works such as "Queen Mary's Psalter" (Brit. Mus.), which belonged to <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary Tudor</a> but which dates from the beginning of the fourteenth century. It contains first more than two hundred scenes from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> bordered with a simple framework of foliage. The figures are graceful and elegant. Then come scenes from the life of Christ executed on gold backgrounds with much greater richness in the midst of innumerable scenes of the chase, tourneys, games, grotesque subjects. The East Anglian <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> (Norfolk, Suffolk) produced magnificent psalters during the same period (Psalter of <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>; <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> of Robert of Ormesby at Oxford) which belong to the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the miniaturists had long been imitating Byzantine art; beginning with the fourteenth century they also imitate French models. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Florian is found the most ancient example of the Biblia Pauperum, executed about 1300 according to the same method as the Sermon Bibles. The taste for miniatures was so keen at this period that they even went so far as to illuminate some important characters. A copy of the house rules of the kings of Majorca shows each of the officials in the exercise of his functions (reproduced in "Acta SS. Bolland.", June, I; cf. list given by Delaborde in "Centenaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Antiquairesde France", 93).
<h3>Late fourteenth, and fifteenth century</h3>

<p>It was in the second half of the fifteenth century that the art of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was most profoundly changed. It may even be said that the illuminators of this period were to a certain extent the precursors of modern <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. This new transformation seems to have been largely the work of the powerful "Ghildes" of the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> masters, versatile artists, many of them skilled like Andr&eacute; Beauneveu in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and architecture, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by stress of competition to leave their own country in order to offer their services to the lovers of beautiful <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. They are found scattered throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and some went even to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Andr&eacute; Beauneveu became (1393-1397) the chief of the artists in the employ of Jean Duke of Berry. He made a <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> (Bib. Nat., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>) in which figures of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and Apostles alternated in quiet tones. It was at this time that <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> began to be <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in <em>grisaille</em>. The gold backgrounds were replaced by designs in colours, then by real landscapes. In this respect the "Tr&egrave;s Riches Heures" of the Duke of Berry (Chantilly, Mus&eacute;e Cond&eacute;), which have been attributed to <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">Pol de Limbourg</a>, mark a veritable revolution (beginning of the fifteenth century). In the pictures of the different months are represented all the ch&acirc;teaux of the prince in the midst of surprisingly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> landscapes. Long before the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eycks</a>, <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">Pol de Limbourg</a> was acquainted with aerial perspective. In his works are found the effects of snow, of starry nights, of dazzling summer lights, the grey tones of autumn, all of which were new in art. Persons were treated with the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Physiognomies copied from nature without disguise of any defect, intensity of look (never was religious sentiment expressed with such power), minute truthfulness as to costumes and details of furnishing, such were the characteristics of this art. Having arrived at this perfection miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> ceased to be a merely decorative art and was confounded with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> on a large scale. The anachronism of costumes belonging to the fifteenth century, whether they have to do with characters from Terence or scenes from the Gospels, is not one of the least charms of these beautiful works. Similar are the other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Jean de Berry, the "Grandes Heures", ascribed to Jacquemart de Hesdin, the "Tr&egrave;s Belles Heures" (Brussels) by the same artist, the "Dukes' Terence" (Paris), which first belonged to the Duke Guyenne. The "Heures de Turin" (destroyed by the fire of 1904), made for William IV, Count of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, belong to the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. About 1450 we can distinguish the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>-Burgundian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (works executed for the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>) from the French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, whose chief representative is <a href="../cathen/06161b.htm">Jean Fouquet</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1415-80). <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> and Italian influences are confused in his works: "Jewish Antiquities" (Paris); "Books of Hours" of Etienne Chevalier (Chantilly); "Grands Chroniques de France" (Paris), etc. After him Jean Bourdichon, who about 1508 decorated the "Hours" of Anne of Brittany (Paris), may be considered the last representative of the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The progress of wood-engraving was as fatal to it, as was that of printing to calligraphy. Until modern times Books of Hours, works of <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">heraldry</a>, etc. have continued to be illuminated, but these miniatures do not possess a single personal quality.
