<h1>Immanence</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>in manere</em>, to remain in)

<p>Immanence is the quality of any action which begins and ends within the agent. Thus, vital action, as well in the physiological as in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral order, is called immanent, because it proceeds from that spontaneity which is essential to the living subject and has for its term the unfolding of the subject's constituent energies. It is initiated and is consummated in the interior of the same being, which may be considered as a closed system. But is this system so shut in as to be self-sufficient and incapable of receiving anything from without? &#151; or can it enrich itself by taking up elements which its environment offers and which are at times even <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as nourishment is to the immanent activity of the body? This is the problem which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> of immanence propose and attempt to solve, not only in respect to man considered as a particular being, but also in respect to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> considered as a whole. It is, indeed, with reference to this latter aspect that the controversy arose in ancient times.
<h2>Historical sketch</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence came into existence simultaneously with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation. This was inevitable, since man first conceived all things after his own likeness. He regarded the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, then, as a living thing, endowed with immanent activity, and working for the full unfolding of its being. Under the veil of poetic fictions, we find this view among the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, and again among the sages of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>. The latter hold a somewhat confused <a href="../cathen/07594a.htm">Hylozoism</a>: as they see it, the cosmos results from the evolution of a single principle (water, air, fire, unity), which develops like an animal organism. But <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, coming back to the study "of things human", refuses to look upon himself as merely part and parcel of the Great All. He asserts his independence and declares himself distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and thus he shifts the pivotal problem of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. What he professes is, indeed, the immanence of the subject, but that immanence he does not conceive as absolute, for he recognizes the fact that man is subject to external influences. Thenceforward, these two conceptions of immanence are to alternate in ascendancy and decline. After <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, absolute immanence regains its sway through Zeno of Cittium, who gives it its clearest expression. In turn it falls back before the preaching of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which sets forth clearly the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of man and the distinction between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world. The Alexandrians, in the wake of Philo, impart a new lustre to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence; but <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, borrowing from Plotinus the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> notion of "seminal principles", contends for relative immanence which in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> triumphs with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. With the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> comes a renewal of life for the theory of absolute immanence. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> maintain the transcendency of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though recognizing the relative immanence of man. But their disciples exaggerate this latter fact and thus fall into subjective monism: the ego is shut up in its absolute immanence; it posits the non-ego. After Fichte, Schelling, and <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, the same path is taken by Cousin, Vacherot, Bergson, and many others. The principle of absolute immanence becomes a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> which they seek to impose upon contemporary philosophy. It confronts <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, and appears as one of the sources of <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">modernism</a>, which it thus brings into close proximity with liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The notion of immanence is at the present day one of the centres around which the battle is being fought between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and monism.

<p>Before passing on to larger development, we note that; <ul><li>(1) under its various aspects, the conception of immanence is the interpretation and extension of a fact observed in the living subject; <li>(2) in every age it takes on two parallel and opposite forms, which the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi gregis" defines in an eminently <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> way, as follows: "Etenim hoc qu&aelig;rimus; an ejusmodi 'immanentia' Deum ab homine distinguat necne? Si distinguit, quid tum a catholica doctrina differt aut doctrinam de revelatione cur rejicit? Si non distinguit, pantheismum habemus. Atqui immanentia haec modernistarum vult atque admittit omne conscienti&aelig; phenomenon ab homine, ut homo est, proficisci" (For, we ask, does this "immanence" make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man distinct or not? If it does, then in what does it differ from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>? or why does it reject what is taught in regard to revelation? If it does not make <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man distinct, it is <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. But this immanence of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> would claim that every phenomenon of consciousness proceeds from man as man).</ul>
<h2>Division</h2>

<p>From this general consideration of the subject the following division arises. <ul><li>A. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence, <ul><li>(1) absolute, <li>(2) relative.</ul></ul> And, as this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has of late years given birth to a new method in <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, we shall next consider: <ul><li>B. The employment of the method of immanence, <ul><li>(1) absolute, <li>(2) relative.</ul></ul>
<h3 id="A">The doctrine of immanence</h3>

<h3 id="A">Absolute immanence</h3>


<h3 id="A">Its historical evolution</h3>

<p>At its outset the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence, properly so called, was concerned with solving the problem of the world's origin and organization: the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was the resultant of an absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, immanent evolution of one only principle. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who gave it its first exact formula, virtually revived the pre-Socratic <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonies</a>. But they shut up in matter first the "Demiurgic Word", in which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> saw the efficient cause of the cosmos; and, then, the transcendently lovable and desirable "Supreme Intelligence", postulated by <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> as the final cause of universal activity. There existed, then, but one principle under a seeming duality; it was corporeal, though it expressed itself sometimes in terms of passivity, when it was called <em>matter</em>, and sometimes in terms of activity, when it was called <em>force</em>, or <em>cause</em>. It was the technic fire presiding over the genesis of the world; it was the Divine seminal principle from which all things were born (<em>pyr technikon, Logos spermatikos</em>). This principle, which is the first to move, is also the first to be moved, since nothing is outside of it; all beings find in it their origin and their end, they are but successive moments in its evolution, they are born and they die through its perpetual becoming. The fiery spirit seems to move the chaotic mass as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> moves the body, and this is why it is called the "soul of the world". Human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are but sparks from it, or rather its phenomena, which vanish at death and are re-absorbed into the bosom of nature. This is <a href="../cathen/07594a.htm">Hylozoism</a> carried to its ultimate expression.

<p>The Greek and Roman <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> changed nothing in this conception. Philo alone, before <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, attempted to transform it. Pursuing the <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretic</a> method which he brought into repute in the School of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, he undertook to harmonize Moses, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Zeno. Thus he was led into a sort of inverted <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>, setting up at the origin of all things no longer a corporeal seminal principle, but a spiritual <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, perfect, anterior to matter, from whom everything is derived by a process of outflow and downflow continued without limit. Proclus, Porphyry, Jamblicus, and Plotinus adopted this emanationist <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which formed the basis of their <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>. From <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> spread over the West through two channels. First, in the fourth century, they entered <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with a certain Mark, who had lived at <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>; in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> they developed by amalgamating with <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a> under the influence of Priscillian, and after the German conquest of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> they passed into Gaul. In the latter country, moreover, they were propagated by the Latin translations of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>. Later on, we find traces of them in <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Eriugena (ninth century), then in <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> (twelfth century), <a href="../cathen/01379b.htm">Amaury of B&ecirc;ne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04645a.htm">David of Dinant</a> (twelfth and thirteenth centuries), and especially in the celebrated <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckhart</a> (fourteenth century). Soon after this the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> restores the ancient doctrines to honourable consideration, and the philosophy of immanence reappears in the commentaries of Pomponatius on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and those of Marsilio Ficino on Plotinus. <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a> saw in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monad</a> of <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monads</a>, who by an inward necessity produces a material creation which is inseparable from Himself. Vanini made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immanent in the forces of nature, while, according to Jacob B&ouml;hme, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acquires reality only through the evolution of the world. By an unbroken tradition, then, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence comes down to modern times. The <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> revolution seems even to favour its development. Exaggerating the distinction between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the former of which moves the latter by means of the pineal gland, the mechanical theories prepared the way for <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche's</a> occasionalism: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone acts; "there is but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cause, because there is but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>." <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>, too, admits only one cause. A disciple of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> in the geometrical rigour of his <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a> processes, but still more a disciple of the rabbis and of <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a> in the spirit of his system, he sets up his <em>natura naturans</em> unfolding its attributes by an immanent progression. This is all but the revival of Alexandrian thought.

<p>True <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesianism</a>, however, was not favourable to theories of this sort, for it is based on personal evidence, and it distinguishes sharply between the world and its transcendent cause. With its vivid realization of the importance and independence of the individual, it follows, rather, the <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socratic</a> tradition. That insight, defined and purified by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, had all along served as a barrier against the encroachment of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence. It could not but derive fresh strength from the philosophy of <em>Cogito</em>, <em>ergo sum</em>, and it was indeed strengthened even to excess. Jealous of its own immanence, which it had learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better than ever, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> overshot its first intention and turned the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence to its own profit. At first it sought only to solve the problem of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while keeping entirely clear of empiricism. In the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> epoch it still claimed for itself only a relative immanence, for it believed in the existence of a transcendent Creator and admitted the existence of noumena, unknowable, to be sure, but with which we maintain relations. Soon the temptation becomes stronger; having hitherto pretended to impose its own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on knowable reality, thought now credits itself with the power of creating that reality. For Fichte, in fact, the ego not only posits <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it also posits the non-ego. It is the pre-eminent form of the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a> (Schelling). No longer is it the Substance that, as <em>natura naturans</em>, produces the world by a process of derivation and degradation without limit; it is an obscure germ, which in its ceaseless becoming, rises to the point of becoming man, and at that point becomes conscious of itself. The absolute becomes <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel's</a> "idea", Schopenhauer's "will", Hartmann's "unconscious", Renan's "time joined to the onward tendency" (<em>le Temps joint &agrave; la tendance au progr&egrave;s</em>), Taine's "eternal axiom", Nietzsche's "superman", Bergson's "conscience". Under all the forms of evolutionistic monism, lies the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence.

<p>Considering the religious tendencies of our age, it was inevitable that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> should have its corresponding effect in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The monism which it preaches, setting aside the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of separateness between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world, also removes entirely the distinction between the natural order and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. It denies anything transcendent in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, which, according to this theory, is only a conception springing from an irresistible need of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or "the ceaseless palpitation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> panting for the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>" (Buisson). The <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> is but the product of our interior evolution; it is of immanent origin, for "it is in the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that the Divine resides". "I am a man, and nothing Divine is foreign to me" (Buisson). Such is the origin of religion in this view. And herein we recognize the thesis of liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> as well as that of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>.
<h3 id="B">The actual content of the doctrine of absolute immanence</h3>

<p>As it is nowadays presented, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence is the resultant of the two great currents of contemporary thought. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, reducing everything to the individual consciousness, and declaring all metaphysical investigation to be illusory, locks the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in its own immanence and condemns it thenceforth to <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a> in regard to transcendent realities. The Positivist movement reaches the same terminus. Through mistrust of that reason which <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> had exalted to such a degree, Comte rejects as worthless every conclusion that goes beyond the range of experience. Thus the two systems, setting out from opposite exaggerations, arrive at one and the same theory of the unknowable: nothing is left us now but to fall back upon ourselves and contemplate the phenomena which emerge from the depths of our own ego. We have no other means of information, and it is from this inner source that all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and all rules of conduct flow out by the immanent evolution of our life, or rather of the Divine which thus manifests itself through us. This initial position determines the solutions which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence furnishes for the problems concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Man.
<h3 id="I">God</h3>

<p>The problems of the Divine life and action are among the foremost to interest the partisans of absolute immanence. They talk incessantly of Trinity, Incarnation, and Redemption, but only, as they claim, to do away with the mysteries and to see in these <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> terms merely the symbols that express the evolution of the first principle. Philo's Trinity, like that of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>, was an attempt to describe this evolution, and the moderns have only resuscitated the Alexandrian allegory. The great being, the great fetish, and the great medium (Comte), the evolving <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, the evolved <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, and their relation (<a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>), unity, variety and their relation (Cousin) &#151; all these, in the thought of their originators, are but so many revivals of the Oriental myths. But <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> now demands the abolition of all such symbols. "The religious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in fact forever interpreting and transforming the traditional <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>" (Sabatier), because the progress of the absolute reveals to us new meanings as it makes us more fully conscious of the Divinity that is immanent in us. Through this progress the incarnation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in humanity goes on without ceasing, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mystery (they make the blasphemous assertion) has no other meaning. There can be no further question of a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>; nor could there have been an original fall, since in this view, disobedient Adam would have been <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. At most the pessimists admit that the Supreme will, or the unconscious, which blundered into the production of the world, will recognize its blunder as it rises to consciousness in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and will repair that blunder by annihilating the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. In that hour of cosmic suicide, according to Hartmann, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Great Crucified</a> will have come down from his cross. Thus is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> terminology incessantly subjected to new interpretations. "We still speak of the Trinity . . ., of the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but with a meaning more or less different from that of our forefathers". Buisson, in his "La Religion, la Morale et la Science", thus explains the influence of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence upon the interpretation of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> in liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.
<h3>The world, life, and the soul</h3>

<p>To explain the origin of the world, the evolution of the Divine principle is put forward. This hypothesis would also account for the organization of the cosmos. Hence the universal order is considered as the outcome of the action of blind energies, and no longer as the realization of a plan conceived and executed by a providence. From the physico-chemical forces life issues; the absolute slumbers in the plant, begins to dream in the animal, and at last awakens to full consciousness in man. Between the stages of this progress there is no breach of continuity; it is one and the same principle which clothes itself in more and more perfect forms, yet never withdraws from any of them. Evolutionism and transformism, therefore, are but parts of that vast system of absolute immanence in which all beings enfold one another, and none is distinct from the universal substance. Consequently, there is no longer any abyss between matter and the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the alleged spirituality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a fable, its <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> an illusion, its individual <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
<h3>Dogma and moral</h3>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a> reaches its highest form in the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it acquires self-consciousness. This means that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> discovers the action of the Divine principle, which is immanent in it as constituting its essential nature. But the perception of this relation with the Divine &#151; or, rather, of this "withinness" of the Divine &#151; is what we are to call Revelation itself (Loisy). At first confused, perceptible only as a vague religious feeling, it develops by means of religious experience (James), it becomes clearer through reflexion, and asserts itself in the conceptions of the religious consciousness. These conceptions formulate <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> &#151; "admirable creations of human thought" (Buisson) &#151; or rather of the Divine principle immanent in human thought. But the expression of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> is always inadequate, for it marks but one moment in the religious development; it is a vesture which the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and especially of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life will soon cast off. In a word all religion wells up from the depths of the sub-conscious (Myers, Prince) by vital immanence; hence the "religious immanence" and the more or less <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostic</a> "symbolism" with which the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi gregis" reproaches the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>.

<p>The human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, creator of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, is also the creator of moral <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, and that by an absolutely autonomous act. Its will is the living and sovereign law, for in it is definitively expressed the will of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immanent in us. The Divine flame, which warms the atmosphere of our life, will inevitably cause those hidden germs of morality to develop which the absolute has implanted. Hence, there can be no longer any question of effort, of virtue, or of responsibility; these words have lost their meaning, since there is neither <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> nor actual and freely willed transgression. There is no longer any blameworthy <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>; all our <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> are impregnated with Divinity, all our desires are just, good, and holy. To follow the impulse of passion, to rehabilitate the flesh (Saint-Simon, Leroux, Fourrier), which is one form under which the Divinity manifests itself (Heine), this is <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. In this way, indeed, we cooperate in the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> which is being accomplished day by day, and which will be consummated when the absolute shall have completed its incarnation in humanity. The part which moral <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> has to play consists in discovering the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which govern this evolution, so that man in his conduct may conform to them (Berthelot) and thus ensure the collective <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of humanity; social utility is to be hence-forward the principle of all morality; solidarity (Bourgeois), which procures it, is the most scientific form of immanent morality, and of this man is, in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the beginning and the end.
<h3 id="B">Relative immanence</h3>

<h3 id="A">Its historical evolution</h3>

<p>Since the day when <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, abandoning the useless <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> hypotheses of his predecessors, brought philosophy back to the study of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose limits and whose independence he defined &#151; since that time the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of relative immanence has held its ground in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence. Relative immanence recognizes the existence of a transcendent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but it also recognizes, and with remarkable precision, the immanence of Psychical life. It is upon the evidence of this fact, indeed, that the admirable pedagogical method, known as <em>maieutic</em>, is founded. <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> thoroughly understood that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not enter our minds ready made from without; that it is a vital function, and therefore immanent. He understood that a cognition is not really ours until we have accepted it, lived it, and in some sort made it over for ourselves. This certainly attributes to the life of thought a real immanence, not, however, an absolute immanence; for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the disciple remains open to the master's influence.

<p>Again we find this conception of relative immanence in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. He transports it, in a rather confused manner, into the <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a> order. He thinks, in fact, that, if there are things great and good and beautiful, they are such through a certain participation in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of greatness, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and beauty. But this participation does not result from an emanation, an outflowing from the Divinity into finite beings; it is only a reflection of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, a resemblance, which the reasonable being is in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound to perfect, as far as possible, by his own energy. With <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> this notion of an immanent energy in <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> acquires a new definiteness. The very exaggeration with which he refuses to admit in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> any efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>, as something unworthy of His beatitude, leads him to place at the heart of finite being the principle of the action which it puts forth with a view to that which is supremely lovable and desirable. Now, according to him, these principles are individualized; their development is limited; their orientation determined to a definite aim; and they act upon one another. It is, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of relative immanence which he maintains. After him the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, reviving the physics of Heraclitus, came back to a system of absolute immanence with their theory of germinal capacities. The Alexandrian Fathers borrowed this term from them, taking out of it, however, its <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> sense, when they set themselves to search in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> for "the sparks of the light of the Word" (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>), and, in human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, for the innate capacities which render the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so easy and so natural. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, in his turn defines these capacities as "the active and passive potentialities from which flow all the natural effects of beings", and this theory he employs to demonstrate the real, but relative, immanence of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral life. Our natural desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and our spontaneous sympathies do not germinate in us unless their seeds are in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. These are the first principles of reason, the universal <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the moral consciousness. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> calls them "habitus principiorum", "seminalia virtutum" "dispositiones naturales", "inchoationes naturales". He sees in them the beginnings of all our physiological, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and moral progress, and, following the course of their development, he carries to the highest degree of precision the concept of relative immanence. The <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a> tradition &#151; continuing after him the struggle against empiricism and positivism on the one side and, on the other, against <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> carried to the extreme of monism &#151; has always defended the same position. It recognizes the fact of immanence, but rejects every exaggeration on either side.
<h3 id="B">Actual content of the doctrine of relative immanence</h3>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> rests upon that innermost experience which reveals to man his individuality, that is to say his inward unity, his distinctness from his environment, and which makes him conscious of his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, that is to say, of his essential independence with respect to the beings with which he is in relation. It, moreover, avoids all imputation of monism, and the manner in which it conceives of immanence harmonizes excellently with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>. "An ejusmodi <em>immanentia</em> Deum ab homine distinguat, necne? Si distinguit, quid tum a catholica doctrina differt?" (Encycl. "Pascendi").
<h3 id="I">God</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, transcends the world which He has created, and in which He manifests His power. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His works; through them we can demonstrate His existence and find out many of His attributes. But the mysteries of His inner life escape us; Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption are known to us only by revelation, to which revelation the immanence of our rational and moral life presents no obstacle whatever.
<h3>The world, life, and the soul</h3>

<p>The organization of the world is governed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, whose ordering action can be conceived in diverse ways, whether we suppose successive interventions for the formation of various beings, or whether, following St. Augustine, we prefer to maintain that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created all things at the same time &#151; "Deus simul omnia creavit" (De Genesi ad lit.). In the latter case we should invoke the hypothesis of germinal capacities, according to which hypothesis <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must have deposited in nature energies of a determinate sort &#151; "Mundus gravidus est causis nascentium" (ibid.) &#151; the evolution of which at favourable junctures of time would organize the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. This organization would be due to an immanent development, indeed, but one proceeding under external influences. Thus did plants, animals, and men appear in succession, though there could be no question of attributing to them a common nature; on the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of relative immanence draws a sharp line of demarcation between the various substances, and particularly between matter and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it is extremely careful to maintain the independence of the human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Not only does this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, joining issue with sensualism, demonstrate that the mind is a living energy, which, far from letting itself be absorbed by influences from without, forms its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and universal principles by its own action under the pressure of experience &#151; not only this, but it also safeguards the autonomy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> against that encroachment of the Divine which the ontologists maintained.
<h3>Dogma and moral</h3>

<p>The human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then, enjoys an immanence and an autonomy which are relative indeed but real, and which Divine Revelation itself respects. Supernatural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, in fact, offered to an intelligence in full possession of its resources, and the reasonable assent which we give to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> is by no means "a bondage" or "a limitation of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of thought". To oppose Revelation with "a preliminary and comprehensive demurrer" ("une fin de non-recevoir pr&eacute;liminaire et globale" &#151; Le Roy) in the name of the principle of immanence, is to misinterpret that principle, which, rightly understood, involves no such exigencies (see below, "The Method of Immanence"). Nor does the fact of relative immanence stand in the way of progress in the understanding of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> "in eodem sensu eademque sententia" (Conc. Vatic., sess. III). The human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then, receives the Divine verities as the disciple receives his master's teaching; it does not create those verities. Neither does it create principles of moral conduct. The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is certainly not foreign to it, being graven upon the very foundation of man's constitution. It lives in the heart of man. This law is immanent to the human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, which consequently enjoys a certain autonomy. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it recognizes its relation to a transcendent legislator, but none the less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it that no prescription coming from another authority would be accepted by the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> if it was in opposition to the primordial law, the requirements of which are only extended and clearly defined by positive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In this sense the human will preserves its autonomy when, in obeying a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, it acts with a fundamentally inviolable liberty. This liberty, however, may be aided by natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> helps. Conscious of its weakness, it seeks and obtains the assistance of grace, but grace does not absorb nature; it only adds to nature, and in no way infringes upon our essential immanence.
<h3 id="B">Employment of the method of immanence</h3>

<p>The notion of immanence occupies so large a place in contemporary philosophy that many make an axiom of it. It is held to be a directing principle of thought and Le Roy makes bold to write that "to have acquired a clear consciousness of the principle of immanence is the essential result of modern philosophy" (Dogme et Critique, 9). Now it is in the name of this principle that "a preliminary and comprehensive demurrer" (ibid.) is presented in bar of all Revelation, for in the light of it "a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> has the appearance of a subjection to bondage, a limitation of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of thought, a menace of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> tyranny" (ibid.). And this creates a religious situation with which <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> is deeply concerned, and with good reason. All the efforts of this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> will be vain, all its arguments inconclusive, if it cannot, first of all, compel minds imbued with the prejudice of absolute immanence to take under consideration the problem of the transcendent. Without this precaution, antinomy is inevitable: on the one hand, it is claimed, the mind cannot receive a heterogeneous <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; on the other, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> proposes to us <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which go beyond the range of any finite intelligence. To solve this difficulty we have recourse to the method of immanence. But this method has been understood in two different ways which lead to diametrically opposite results.
<h3 id="A">Method based on the idea of absolute immanence</h3>

<p>This is the positivist and subjectivist method. It consists in accepting off-hand the postulate of an absolute immanence of the rational and moral life. It is therefore <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to lower <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the level of scientific <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which the mind attains solely by its own energy. Thus, some, like Lechartier, have proposed to modify dogmatic formul&aelig; and "dissolve the symbols" of them in order to harmonize both with the aspirations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which thinks them. By this means "the higher realities, which religious myths have for so many centuries striven to express, will be found identical with those which positive <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> has just established". Revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will then appear as coming from us; it will present itself as the reflexion of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which changes its formul&aelig; according as it can or cannot find itself in them. In this way there will no longer be any antinomy, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> will be the principle of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. Others following Loisy, hope to find in themselves, through a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis, the expression of revelation. This would be the outcome of an immanent progress, "the consciousness which man has acquired of his relations with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Revelation is realized in man, but it is "the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him, with him, and by him". Thus the difficulty arising out of the opposition between the natural order and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> would disappear &#151; but at the price of a return to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of absolute immanence. It seems, too, that Laberthonni&egrave;re, though in spite of his principles, ends by accepting this very same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which he had undertaken to combat, when he writes that "since our action is at once ours and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>, we must find in it the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> element which enters into its constitution". According to this view, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis will discover the Divine element immanent in our action, the inward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "more present to us than we ourselves". Now this "living God of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>" can be discerned only through an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> which we get by a sort of moral and dynamic ontologism. But how will this presence of the Divine manifest itself in us? By the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and imperative demand of our nature which calls for the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. &#151; Such is the abuse of the method of immanence which the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi gregis" points out and deplores: "And here again we have reason for grievous complaint, because among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there are to be found men who, while repudiating the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, make use of it nevertheless for apologetic purposes, and do this so recklessly that they seem to admit in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> a genuine exigency properly so called in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>." With still tess reserve, those whom the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> calls <em>inteqralist&oelig;</em> boast of showing the unbeliever the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> germ which has been transmitted to humanity from the consciousness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and hidden in the heart of every man. This is the thought of Sabatier and of Buisson, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> &#151; "I am a man, and nothing Divine is foreign to me" (Buisson).
<h3 id="B">Method based on the idea of relative immanence</h3>

<p>There is another application of the method of immanence much more reserved than the one just described since it keeps within the natural order and confines itself to stating a philosophic problem, viz.: Is man sufficient for himself? or is he aware of his insufficiency in such a way as to realize his need of some help from without? Here we are not at all concerned &#151; as the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi gregis" reproaches the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> &#151; "with inducing the unbeliever to make trial of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion"; we are concerned only with; <ul><li>(1) compelling a man who analyzes his own being to break through the circle within which, supposedly, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence confines him, and which makes him reject a priori, as out of the question, the whole argument of objective <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>; and then <li>(2) with bringing him to recognize in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> "a capacity and fitness for the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologists, using the proper reservations, have demonstrated" (Encycl. "Pascendi gregis").</ul>

<p>In other words, this method has in itself nothing that calls for condemnation. It consists, says Maurice Blondel, its inventor, "in equating within our own consciousness, what we seem to think, to wish, and to do with what we really do, wish and think, in such a way that in the fictitious negations, or the ends artificially desired, those profound affirmations and irrepressible needs which they imply shall still be found" (Lettre sur les exigences). This method endeavours to prove that man cannot shut himself up in himself, as in a little world which suffices unto itself. To prove this, it takes an inventory of our immanent resources; it brings to light, on the one hand, our irresistible aspirations towards the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> True, Good, and Beautiful, and, on the other hand, the insufficiency of our means to attain these ends. This comparison shows that our nature, left to itself, is not in a state of equilibrium; that, to achieve its destiny, it needs a help which is essentially beyond it &#151; a transcendent help. Thus, "a method of immanence developed in its integrity becomes exclusive of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immanence". In fact, the internal analysis which it prescribes brings the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to recognize itself as relative to a transcendent being, thereby setting before us the problem of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nothing more is needed to make it evident that the "preliminary and comprehensive demurrer", which it sought to set up against Revelation in the name of the principle of immanence, is an unwarranted and arrogant exaggeration. The psychologic <a href="../cathen/05675a.htm">examination of conscience</a> which is just now being made, far from ruling out the traditional apologetic, rather appeals to it, opens the way for it, and demonstrates its necessity.

<p>To this preliminary clearing of the ground the method adds a subjective preparation which shall dispose the individual for the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by exciting in him the desire to enter into relations with the transcendent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the result of this preparation will be not only <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and theoretical, but also moral and practical. Arousing in him a more vivid consciousness of his weakness and his need of help, the method will impel a man to acts of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> which inspire <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and attract grace.

<p>Such is the twofold service which the method based on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of relative immanence can render. Within these limits, it is rigorous. But could it not go farther, and open to us a view of the nature of this transcendent being whose existence it compels us to recognize? Might it not, for example, bring the unbeliever to hear and heed "the appeal of preventive or <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>" which would then express itself in psychologic facts discernible by observation and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> analysis (<a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Cardinal Dechamps</a>)? Would it not enable us to experience <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or at least "to find in our action the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> element which is said to enter into His Constitution" (P&egrave;re Laberthonni&egrave;re)? Would it not, finally, justify us in affirming with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that the object of our "irrepressible aspirations" is a "supernatural Unnamed" (Blondel), an object which is "beyond and above the natural order" (Ligeard)?

<p>At this point the method of immanence stirs the delicate problem of the relation between nature and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>; but it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the method can solve this problem by its immanent analysis. All the attempts referred to above when they lead to anything, seem to do so only at the price of confounding the notion of the transcendent with that of the preternatural, or even of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> &#151; or, again, at the price of confounding the Divine co-operation and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. In a word, if the psychologic analysis of the tendencies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> ends in "showing, without recourse to what Revelation gives us, that man desires <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> more than the natural order can give him" (Ligeard), it does not follow that we can say with any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that this "desired increase" is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Unnamed. As a matter of fact, <ul><li>(1) the natural order far exceeds in vastness the object of my analysis; <li>(2) between my nature and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> there is the preternatural; <li>(3) the aids to which my nature aspires, and which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives me, are not necessarily of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>.</ul>

<p>Besides, even if a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> action does in fact manifest itself under these religious aspirations, immanent analysis, apprehending only <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> phenomena, cannot detect it. But the question is still under consideration; it is not for us to solve the mystery of the transcendent in a definitive manner and from the point of view of the method of immanence.
