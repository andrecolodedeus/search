<h1>Imola</h1>  

<p>(Imolensis)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of Bologna. The city is located on the Santerno, and was anciently called Forum Cornelii, from the dictator L. Cornelius Sulla, who founded it about 82 B.C. The name Imola was first used in the seventh century by the Lombards, who applied it to the fortress (the present Castellaccio, the construction of which is attributed to the Lombard Clefi), whence the name passed to the city itself. According to <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, Imola was in 412 the scene of the marriage of Atawulf, King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, and Placidia, daughter of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a>. In the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and after the Lombard invasion, it was held alternately by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and barbarians. With the exarchate it passed under <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. In the ninth century it was <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> defended against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and Hungarians by Fausto Alidosi. In the tenth century Troilo Nordiglio acquired great power. This and the following centuries witnessed incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the Ravennatese, the Faentines, and Bolognese, as well as the intestine struggles of the <em>Castrimolesi</em> (Castro Imolese) and the <em>Sancassianesi</em> (San Cassiano). Amid these conflicts was formed the republican constitution of the city. In the contest between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor Imola was generally <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>, though it often returned to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (e.g. in 1248). Several times, powerful lords attempted to obtain the mastery of the city (Alidosi, 1292; Maghinardo Pagano, 1295). <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> turned the city and its territory over to Lippo Alidosi with the title of pontifical vicar, the power remaining in the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (Alidosi) until 1424, when Angelo della Pergola, "capitano" for Filippo Maria Visconti, gained the supremacy. But in 1426 the city was restored to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> (later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Capranica inaugurated a new regime in public affairs.

<p>In 1434, 1438, and 1470 Imola was conferred on the Sforza, who had become lords of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. It was again brought under <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority when it was bestowed as dowry on Catherine Sforza, the bride of Girolamo Riario, nephew of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. Riario was invested with the Principality of <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a> and Imola. This <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> advantageous to Imola, which was embellished with beautiful palaces and works of art (e.g. in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Girolamo, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 1488 by conspirators of <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a>). The rule of the Riarii, however, was brief, as <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> deprived Ottaviano, son of Girolamo, of power, and on 25 November, 1499, the city surrendered to Caesar Borgia. On his death two factions, that of Galeazzo Riario and that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, contested the rule of the city. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party was victorious, and in 1504 Imola submitted to <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. The last trace of these contests was a bitter enmity between the Vaini and Sassatelli <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. In 1797 the French established a provisional government at Imola; in 1799 it was occupied by the Austrians; in 1800 it was united to the Cisalpine Republic. After that it shared the fortunes of the Romagna.

<p>Noteworthy among the secular edifices of Imola are the Farsetti and the municipal palaces. In the latter is a fresco representing <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1535) passing through the city. The public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was established in 1747 by the Conventual Padre Setti. In the sixteenth century the Accademia degli Industriosi flourished. Among the celebrated men of Imola were: Pope Honorius II; Benvenuto da Imola (Rambaldi), a lecturer on <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a> in the fourteenth century, Taddeo della Volpe, a captain in the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (in 1510 <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> presented him with a staff bearing the image of a fox and his device: S<font size=-2>IMUL ASTU ET DENTIBVS UTAR</font>); Giovanni Sassatelli, surnamed <em>il Cagnaccio</em>, who was also a captain; Ottaviano Vestri and his son Marcello, famous jurists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; <a href="../cathen/07693a.htm">Innocenzo da Imola (Francucci)</a>, a pupil of Francia and Gaspare Sacchi, distinguished <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>; Andrea and Giuseppe Bagnari, noted for their skill in inlaid work; Cosimo Morelli, the famous architect who designed the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> origins of Imola are obscure. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> certainly antedates <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, who <em>sede vacante</em> ordered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vigorenza to visit the church of Imola and provide for the election of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Saint Cassian is likewise certain, being described by Prudentius (Peristeph., IX) from pictures seen by him in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Imola. Saint Cassian was a schoolmaster, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by his pupils, under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. Some have identified him with Saint Cassian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabiona (Saeben in the Tyrol), said to have been transferred to Imola, but this would place the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>. In 435 <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> built the church of S. Maria in Arenula. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then was St. Cornelius, whose <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> by <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> and is known as St. Peter Chrysologus. His successor was Projectus, at whose <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> Chrysologus pronounced a magnificent eulogy of St. Cornelius. Chrysologus himself was buried at Imola. His tombstone, discovered in 1698, was a rude block on which was written PETRUS. Of the gifts of St. Peter Chrysologus to the church of Imola there is still preserved a <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, with the figure of a lamb on an altar, surrounded by the metrical legend

<blockquote><p>Quem plebs tunc cara crucis agnum fixit in ara. <br>Hostia fit gentis primi pro labe parentis. </p></blockquote>

<p>These leonine verses, however, indicate a much more recent date. At the same period flourished the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> St. Donatus. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> worthy of mention are: John (946), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and embellished the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Peter Chrysologus; Blessed Basil (1063); Ridolfo (1146), and Enrico (1174), who suffered for their adherence to <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, Enrico laid the foundations of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, finished in 1271 under Bishop Sinibaldo; Pietro Ondedei (1416), a distinguished canonist and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Gaspare Sighigelli (1450), learned and saintly; Girolamo Dandini (1546), formerly <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, founder of an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>; Francesco Guarini (1566), the founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Cardinal Fabio Chigi (1652), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a>; Cardinal Filippo Gualtieri (1702), founder of a <em>mone frumentario</em> to supply the poor peasant with seed; Cardinal Giancarlo Bandi (1752), who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the basilica of Valentinian; Cardinal Barnaba Chiaramonti (1785), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a>; Cardinal Giovanni Maria Mastai Ferretti (1832), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>.

<p>Imola has 121 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 120,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 7 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 12 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys, and 12 for girls.
