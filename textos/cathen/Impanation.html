<h1>Impanation</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> according to which Christ is in the Eucharist through His human body substantially united with the substances of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, and thus is <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made bread: <em>Deus panis factus</em>. As, in consequence of the Incarnation, the properties of the Divine Word can be ascribed to the man Christ, and the properties of the man Christ can be predicated of the Word (<em>communicatio idiomatum</em>), in the very same way, in consequence of the impanation &mdash; a word coined in imitation of incarnation &mdash; an interchange of predicates takes place between the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the substance of bread, though only through the mediation of the body of Christ. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of impanation agrees with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/04322a.htm">consubstantiation</a>, as it was taught by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, in these two essential points: it denies on the one hand the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> into the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and on the other professes nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a>. Yet the doctrines differ essentially in so far as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> asserted that the Body of Christ penetrated the unchanged substance of the bread but denied a <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>. Orthodox <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> expressed this so-called sacramental union between the Body of Christ and the substance of bread in the well-known formula: The Body of Christ is "in, with and under the bread" &mdash; <em>in, cum et sub pane;</em> <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a>, though only at the moment of its reception by the faithful &mdash; <em>in usu, non extra usum</em>. The <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Reformed Churches, calling this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, in their attack against the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, <em>impanation</em>, use the term not in the strict sense explained above, but in a wider meaning.

<p>If we search for the historic origin of the term, we must go back to the controversies against the disciples of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a> at the end of the eleventh century. Guitmund of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a> (died before 1195), in his work "De corporis et sanguinis Christi veritate in Eucharisti&acirc;" (P.L., CXLIX, 1427 sqq.), distinguishes two classes of disciples of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>; those who absolutely deny the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a>, and those who, though they admit that the Body and Blood of Christ are really (<em>rever&acirc;</em>) present in the Eucharist, reject the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> and explain <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Christ's Real Presence</a> by a kind of impanation (<em>Christum quodammodo impanari</em>). Guitmund thinks this to be the essence of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (<em>hanc esse subtiliorem Berengarii sententiam</em>). This teaching, however rightly or wrongly attributed to <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, evidently does not profess impanation in the strict sense of the term; it rather coincides with the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/04322a.htm">consubstantiation</a> as taught by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. <a href="../cathen/01310c.htm">Alger of Li&egrave;ge</a> (1131), in his work, "De sacramento corporis et sanguinis Christi", I, 6 (P.L., CLXXX, 439-845), without mentioning any definite names, points out and opposes the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of some (<em>errantes quidam</em>) who say that "Christ's Person is impanated in the bread, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is incarnated in the human flesh" (dicunt ita personaliter in pane impanatum Christum sicut in came human&acirc; personaliter incarnatum Deum). He calls this a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which ought to be utterly rooted out, because it is an absurd novelty (<em>quia nova et absurda</em>). Who was it that introduced this new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>? For a long time the well-known Abbot Rupert of Deutz (1135) was suspected. Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (De Euch., III, xi, xv), <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> (Ann. Eccl.: ad annum 1111, n. 49), Francisco Su&aacute;rez, and Vasquez thought they could trace back the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of impanation to him (cf. his work "De div. officiis", II, 2 and 9), and recently P. Rocholl ("Rupert v. Deutz", G&uuml;tersloh, 1886, 247 sqq.) repeated the same charge. Others, however, acquit him of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as Alexander Natalis, Tourn&eacute;ly, and especially Gerberon in his "Apologia Ruperti Tuitiensis" (Paris, 1669); and, amongst modern writers of the history of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, J. Bach ("Dogmengeschichte des Mittelalters", I, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1875, 412 sqq.) and <a href="../cathen/13592a.htm">Schwane</a> ("Dogmengeschichte", III, Freiburg, 1882, 641). They seem to be right, for a critical examination of all the passages bearing on the subject shows that Rupert, though at times he used ambiguous expressions, nevertheless believed in the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> of the substance of bread into the Body of Christ. However this be, it cannot now be decided whether <a href="../cathen/01310c.htm">Alger of Li&egrave;ge</a> cited Rupert as an advocate of impanation, since it remains unknown whether Rupert had already published his ambiguous expression at the time when <a href="../cathen/01310c.htm">Alger</a> wrote his attack.

<p>With much better reason, <a href="../cathen/08475b.htm">John of Paris</a> (died 1306) is considered the champion of the strict <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of impanation. In his work, "Determinatio de modo existendi corpus [<em>sic</em>] Christi in sacramento altaris alio quam sit ille quem tenet Ecclesia" (ed. Peter Alix, London, 1686), he tries, in conscious opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to establish, as plausible at least, the hypothesis that "the bread does not remain in its own <em>suppositum</em>, but is assumed through the Flesh or through the Body of Christ as a part of the <em>esse</em> and hypostasis of the Logos" (Ego dico panem ibi manere non in proprio supposito, sed tractum ad esse et suppositum Verbi, mediante carne aut corpore parte). Consequently, he maintains that it is correct to say: "The Body of Christ is 'impanated', i.e. has become bread" (<a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> impanatum, I. e. panis factum); still it cannot be said that "the Man or Christ has become bread" (sed hominem aut Christum non possumus dicere impanatum), an explanation which is certainly not too conspicuous for clearness and precision. Amongst the reformers, Andreas Osiander (died 1552), a fervent disciple of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, seems to have held the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of impanation, though later <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have tried to acquit him of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. It is, however, difficult to discern the real meaning of this fiery writer from his confused expressions. For this reason <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, in a letter of 22 March, 1538, to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Vitus Theodorus in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, merely expresses his suspicion that Osiander held the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of impanation. Both <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> were thoroughly opposed to this absurd opinion. And this for many reasons, but especially because they would have been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to adore in the strictest sense of the word (<em>cultu latri&oelig;</em>) the bread <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatically united</a> with the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and this would have been in diametrical opposition to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> principles and practices of the Lord's Supper. Recently, Bayma, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, in a series of theses proposed a theory on <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>, which, upon critical examination, comes very close to the above mentioned teaching of <a href="../cathen/15636b.htm">William of Paris</a>; in fact, it seems to explain the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a> by impanation. He bases his theory on the proposition that the substance of bread, in consequence of the conversion, ceases to be substance, and that it receives a new subject, without undergoing interior change, having its support no longer in itself but in another suppositum (substantia panis desinit esse substantia eo solum, et absque ali&acirc; sui mutatione, quod in alio supernaturaliter sustentatur, ita ut jam non in se sit, sed in alio ut in primo subjecto). Consequently it is the Body of Christ that supports the nature of the bread (Corpus Christi sustentat naturam panis). Of this hypothesis, which denies a real <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> entirely, or admits it only nominally, the Holy Office justly declared: <em>tolerari non posse</em> (7 July, 1875 &mdash; cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", 1843-46, 10th ed., Freiburg, 1908). The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of impanation as far as it denies the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> is certainly a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; besides, it is also against reason, since a <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> between the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Incarnate, or the God-man Christ, and the dead substances of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> is inconceivable. Much less conceivable is such a union if we presuppose <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>, for since the substance of bread no longer exists it cannot enter into a <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> with Christ.
