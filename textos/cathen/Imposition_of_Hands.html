<h1>Imposition of Hands</h1>  

<p>A symbolical <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> by which one intends to communicate to another some favour, quality or excellence (principally of a spiritual kind), or to depute another to some office. The rite has had a profane or secular as well as a sacred usage. It is extremely ancient, having come down from patriarchal times. Jacob bequeathed a blessing and inheritance to his two sons Ephraim and Manasses by placing his hands upon them (<a href="../bible/gen048.htm#vrs14">Genesis 48:14</a>) and Moses on <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> the hegemony of the Hebrew people in the same manner (<a href="../bible/num027.htm#vrs18">Numbers 27:18, 23</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> employed this rite to restore life to the daughter of Jairus (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs18">Matthew 9:18</a>) and to give health to the sick (<a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs19">Luke 6:19</a>). The religious aspect of this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> first appeared in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Aaron and his sons to the office of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Before immolating animals in sacrifice the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> ritual, laid hands upon the heads of the victims (<a href="../bible/exo029.htm">Exodus 29</a>; <a href="../bible/lev008.htm#vrs9">Leviticus 8:9</a>); and in the expressive dismissal of the scapegoat the officiant laid his hands on the animal's head and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people might descend thereon and be expiated in the wilderness (<a href="../bible/lev016.htm#vrs21">Leviticus 16:21</a>). The Apostles imposed hands on the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that they might receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost in confirmation (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs17">Acts 8:17, 19</a>; <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs6">19:6</a>); on those to be promoted to holy orders (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs6">Acts 6:6</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs3">13:3</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs14">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs6">2 Timothy 1:6</a>; <a href="../bible/mat013.htm">Matthew 13</a>); and on others to bestow some <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gift</a> or corporal benefit (Acts, <em>passim</em>). In fact this rite was so constantly employed that the "imposition of hands" came to designate an essential <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#vrs2">Hebrews 6:2</a>).

<p>To understand clearly the extent to which the imposition of hands is employed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at present it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to view it in its sacramental or <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> as well as in its ceremonial or <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> aspect. In confirmation, the imposition of hands constitutes the essential matter of the sacrament, not however that which precedes the anointing, but that which takes place at the actual application of the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> (S.C. de Prop. Fide, 6 Aug., 1840). In the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> it enters either wholly or in part, into the substance of the rite by which most of the higher grades are conferred. Thus in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> according to the Latin rite it is at least partial matter of the sacrament; in conferring the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> there is a threefold imposition, viz.: (a) when the ordaining <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> followed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, lays hands on the head of the candidate <em>nil dicens;</em> (b) when he and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> extend hands during the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "Oremus, fratres carissimi", and (c) when he imposes hands at giving power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, saying "Accipe Spiritum Sanctum". The first and second of these impositions combined constitute in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> partial matter of the sacrament, the <em>traditio instrumentorum</em> being required for the adequate or complete matter. The Greeks, however, rely on the imposition alone as the substance of the sacramental rite. In the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the imposition of hands alone pertains to the essence (see <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">C<font size=-2>ONFIRMATION</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">O<font size=-2>RDERS</font></a>).

<p>The ceremonial usage is much more extensive. (1) In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> signs the forehead and breast with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, lays hands on the head during the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "preces nostras", and again after the <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, beseeching <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to send down the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into the purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (cf. Rom. Rit.). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> mentions imposition being used in conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in his own day (de Bap., VI, VII, &amp;c.). (2) In penance the minister merely raises his hand at the giving of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. The ancient <em>ordines</em> (cf. Martene, "De antiqua ecclesi&aelig; disciplina", <em>passim</em>), record this custom. (3) In extreme unction there is no imposition of hands enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, although in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> immediately before the anointing the words "per impositionem manuum nostrarum" occur. Possibly the imposition is contained in the unctions as it is in the administration of confirmation. (4) Apart from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the rite is also employed in almost all the various <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and things. Abbots and virgins are thus blessed (cf. Roman Pontifical and Ritual). (5) In the reconciliation of public penitents and the reception of schismatics, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, hands were formerly, and still are, imposed (cf. Duchesne, "Christian Worship", pp. 328, 435, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, <a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>De Lapsis</em> 16</a>). (6) Those obsessed by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> are similarly <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcized</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, Titus, x, cl). (7) The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> direct the celebrant to hold his hands extended during most of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. At the pre-consecration <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "Hanc igitur oblationem", he also holds his hands over the <em>oblata</em>. This action seems borrowed from the old <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a> practice, already noticed, of laying hands on the victims to be sacrificed, but curiously it has not been proved to be very old. Le Brun (Explication de la Messe, iv, 6) says he did not find the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> in any <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> older than the fifteenth century. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> made it <em>de pr&aelig;cepto</em> (cf. Gihr, "la Messe", II, 345). The significance of the act is expressive, symbolizing as it does the laying of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon the elements of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> which, being changed into the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, become thus our emissary or scapegoat, and finally the "victim of our peace" with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nothing can better show the relationship that has always existed between <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> that is being considered, than this expressive sentence from St. Augustine, "Quid aliud est manuum impositio, quam oratio super hominem?" (De Bap., III, xvi, 21).
