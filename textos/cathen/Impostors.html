<h1>Impostors</h1>  

<p>Under this heading we may notice a certain number of objectionable characters who, while not of sufficient importance to claim separate treatment, have at various epochs so far achieved <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> or caused disturbance in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by their mendacity or their moral turpitude, that they cannot be entirely passed over in such a work as the present. That there would be <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> who would take advantage of a profession of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to mask their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> designs had been clearly foretold by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the Gospels. "Beware of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>," He had said, "who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs15">Matthew 7:15</a>), and again "there will rise up <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Christs and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>" (<a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs22">Mark 13:22</a>), The same note is heard in the other books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; for example: "Many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are gone out into the world" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs1">1 John 4:1</a>); "But there were also <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> among the people, even as there shall be among you <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> teachers" (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs1">2 Peter 2:1</a>), and the early fulfilment of these predictions is attested by the language of the "Didache" (cc. xi and xvi), and by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> (about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 150) who observes: "Our Lord said that many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Christs would appear in His name and would deceive many; and so it has come about. For many have taught godless, blasphemous and unholy doctrines forging them in His name" (<a href="../fathers/01286.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 82</a>). Putting aside, as lying beyond our province, the succession of pseudo-Messiahs among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, men like John of Gischala and Simon Bar-Giora, who played so terrible a part in the story of the siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, we may recognize in the <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> of whom we read in Acts viii 5-24, the first <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> impostor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Christian church history</a>. He offered St. Peter money that he might have power to impart to others the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the Acts do not tell us very much more about him than that he had previously practised <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">sorcery</a> and bewitched the people of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> and other early writers inform us that he afterwards went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there by the power of demons, and received Divine honours both in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in his own country. Though much extravagant legend afterwards gathered round the name of this Simon, and in particular the story of a supposed contest in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> between him and St. Peter, when Simon attempting to fly was brought to earth by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle's</a> word, breaking his leg in his fall, it seems nevertheless probable that there must be some foundation in fact for the account given by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> and accepted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. The historical <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> founded some sort of religion as a counterfeit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in which he claimed to play a part analogous to that of Christ.

<p>With the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the second and third centuries, as with those of later ages, a large number of impostors were unquestionably associated. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Marcus is declared to have combined the most extravagant teaching of formul&aelig;, by which the initiated would after death leave their bodies in this world, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and "ascend in their spirits at the pleroma", with the lowest kind of juggling tricks, pretending, for example, to show the contents of a glass <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> changed in colour after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (Iren&aelig;us, "Contra H&aelig;reses", I, xiii- xxi). Similarly it is at least very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the frenzied prophesyings of the two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, Priscilla and Maximilla, who left their husbands to scour the country of Phrygia with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Montanus, are not to be regarded as conscious impostures. Their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> opponents strenuously maintained that all the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed by the devil</a> and ought to be compelled to submit to <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>. Neither were such extravagances confined to the East although they most abounded there. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> tells us of a half crazy fanatic at the end of the sixth century who declared himself to be Christ and who travelled in the neighbourhood of Arles in company with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he called Mary. He was declared to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of healing and crowds of people believed in him and paid him Divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. In the end he moved about with a following of more than three thousand <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> until he was killed in offering <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to an envoy of Bishop Aurelius. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Mary under torture made a disclosure of all his <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">frauds</a>, but many of the populace still believed in them, and a number of other adventurers accompanied by hysterical prophetesses seem to have flourished in Gaul at the same epoch (Greg. Turon., "Hist.", X, 25). Still more famous were the impostors Adelbert and Clement, who opposed the authority of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> about the year 744. Adelbert, who was a Gaul, claimed to have been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> favours from his birth. He drew the people away from the churches, gave them pieces of his nails and hair as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and told them that it was unnecessary for them to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to him because he already read their hearts. Clement, a Scotsman, rejected the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> about marriage and other disciplinary questions and maintained that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/07143d.htm">descent into Hell</a>, had set free all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> confined there, even the lost and the unbaptized. The question of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was referred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and discussed by Pope Zachary in a council held there in 745, at which there was read aloud a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> letter from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> which Adelbert pretended had fallen from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and had been picked up by the <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Archangel Michael</a>. In the end the council pronounced sentence of deposition and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the two accused (cf. Hefele, "Conciliengeschichte", &#167;&#167; 363-367; Hauck, "Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands", I, 554 seq.).



<p>Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> we meet with many examples of such half crazy fanatics, and our imperfect information does not usually allow us to pronounce in what measure insanity or conscious <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> was responsible for their pretensions. Such cases are wont more particularly to be multiplied at times of national calamity or religious excitement. The epoch of the year 1000, owing to some vague expectation (an expectation, however, which has been much exaggerated), of the coming of the day of judgment (cf. Apoc. xx, 7) marked such a crisis, and <a href="../cathen/06574b.htm">Raoul Glaber</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXLII, 643-644) tells us in particular of two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> agitators, one named Leotardus, at <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, and the other Wilgardus, at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, who at that time caused great disturbance. Leotardus pretended to have had extraordinary revelations and preached some sort of socialistic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> preventing the people from paving <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. When his followers eventually deserted him he drowned himself in a well. Wilgardus appears to have been a literary fanatic who believed that he had been commanded by Virgil, Horace, and Juvenal in a vision to correct the dogmatic teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He had many followers and formed for a while a sort of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> until he was condemned by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. Of all the deluded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, however, whose sanity must always remain in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> John of Leyden (John Bokelzoon), who became tyrant of M&uuml;nster at a much later period (1533), is the most remarkable. He believed himself endowed with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> powers and gifts, but preferred to act as the public executioner of his own sentences, hacking his victims to pieces with his own hands. The period of the great Schism of the West was also an epoch when many fanatical or designing <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> reaped a rich harvest out of the credulity of the populace. A Greek, known as Paulus Tigrinus, pretending to be <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, after a successful career of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and elsewhere, came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was detected and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>. At the election of <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> he was released and took refuge with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, whom he imposed upon with the same pretence of being the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. By this prince he was sent with a dozen horses to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and received as patriarch by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. Thence he eventually made his escape, carrying with him many rich presents which he had received from the deluded Clement. Another famous impostor of this period was a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, one James of J&uuml;lich, who performed all the functions of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without ever having received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. He was at first admitted as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> auxiliary by Florentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. Great <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and disturbance were caused when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was discovered, on account of the large numbers of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom he had (of course invalidly) <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> degraded, in 1392, by a commission of seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and on being handed over to the secular arm was sentenced to be boiled alive, but this sentence was mitigated in execution. Nothing, however, could more clearly illustrate the extent to which a period of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> encourages visionaries and religious impostors than the history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France's</a> sainted heroine, <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>. In fact the principal obstacle to the recognition of her own inspiration has been found in the circumstance that several other visionaries, of whom Catherine of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> was the most noted, claimed similar Divine missions at about the same period. The facts have been exaggerated for their own purposes by such writers as Vallet de Viriville (Charles VII, II, 129) and Anatole <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Jeanne d'Arc, II, 96); but there certainly were a number of such impostors, both male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>; and in particular five years after the Maid was burnt at the stake another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> impersonated her, was received at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, and found influential supporters in that character for more than three years.

<p>Other cases of imposture in the fifteenth century were undoubtedly fostered by the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffite</a> and Hussite <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. If Sir John Oldcastle, the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffite</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, really believed, as is asserted on good contemporary authority, that he would rise again three days after his death, he was clearly the victim of delusions, but the details associated with the veneration of the ashes of Richard Wyche, burned in 1440 (Gairdner, "Lollardy", I, 171), imply some admixture of deliberate <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the social revolt so largely encouraged by Hussite doctrines was turned to account by more than one adventurer. Johann B&ouml;hm, who in 1476 gathered round him a crowd of peasants, numbering sometimes as many as 30,000, at Nikiashausen in Franconia, seems to have been the tool of <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> more astute than himself. He professed to have had revelations from the Blessed Virgin, and declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon all recognition of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority, upon the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and in fact upon all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. He was eventually captured by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wurzburg and burnt (Janssen, "Gesch. d. deutschen Volkes", II, 401). Somewhat similar in its partially social aims was the rebellion on English soil of Jack Cade, who professed to be a descendant of the Earls of Mortimer. How far these pretensions and a certain mountebank element in his character gained him his influence over his followers it is difficult to decide. After <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> had for a day or two been in the hands of the rebels, the revolt was put down, and Cade eventually slain (1450). Two other impostures of somewhat later date &mdash; those of Lambert Simnel (1487), who pretended to be the son of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> Duke of Clarence, and Perkin Warbeck (1497), who announced himself as Richard Duke of York, the younger of the two princes believed to have been smothered in the Tower &mdash; are famous in English history, but neither of them had any <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. For the same reason we need not touch here upon sundry other noted impersonations of characters of royal dignity, e.g. the Alexis Comnenus who appeared in the twelfth century as the rival of Isaac Comnenus II; the Baldwin who appeared in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> in 1225 after the death of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Baldwin in the East; the adventurer who impersonated Frederic II and who when seized and tortured by the Emperor Rudolph in 1284 confessed the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, not to speak of several others. Two similar pretenders to royalty, however, are of more consequence, and the impersonation, if impersonation it was, is buried in deeper mystery. When King Sebastian of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1578 fought his last desperate battle against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> upon African soil, there was some conflict of evidence regarding the manner of his death, and though what purported to be his dead body was brought back and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, rumours persistently circulated that he had escaped and was still alive. Influenced by the fact that <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> now claimed and occupied the throne of the sister kingdom, a whole series of pretenders appeared, each averring that he was in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the Sebastian whom men believed to have perished. The first three of these claimants were vulgar rogues, but the fourth played his part with extraordinary firmness and consummate ability. He obtained recognition from a number of people who had known Sebastian well, and though the Spanish Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> seized him and sent him to the galleys, he seems to have been treated by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> authorities with a curious degree of consideration. Even now it cannot be affirmed with absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that his story was a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> one, though nearly all historians pronounce against him.

<p>Still more <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> is the case of "the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Demetrius". The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Demetrius, the son of Tsar Ivan, the Terrible, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 1592. Muscovy after Ivan's death fell into terrible <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, and not long afterwards there appeared in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> a young man who declared that he was Demetrius who had escaped the massacre, and that he now meant to press his claim to the throne of the Tsars. Sigismund, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, lent him his support. He made himself master of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and was generally received with enthusiasm, although he made no secret of the fact that during his residence in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> he had adopted the Roman Faith. Probably the merits of the historical controversy as to his identity have never been quite fairly judged, because all have agreed in describing him as a tool of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and have, consequently, taken it for granted that the whole claim was a political coup devised by them to draw <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> over to the Roman obedience. It has, however, been clearly shown how <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> is the assumption that Demetrius was really an impostor. (See Pierling, "Rome et D&eacute;m&eacute;trius", Paris, 1878; and "La Russie et le Saint-Si&egrave;ge" of the same author.) Of the other royal pretenders, and notably of the six various adventurers who came forward in the character of the Dauphin Louis, the son of Louis XVI, there is no need to say anything. Neither need we linger over such fantastic personages as Paracelsus (Philip Bombast von Hohenheim, 1493-1541), who, despite his parade of cabbalistic formul&aelig; and his pretence of <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a>, was really for his age a scientific genius, or Nostradamus (1503-1566), the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who also practised as a physician, or Cagliostro (Giuseppe Balsamo, 1743-1795), who died in the dungeons of the Castle of Sant' Angelo after an almost unprecedented career of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, in which a sort of <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemasonry</a>, called "Egyptian Masonry", invented by him in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, played a notable part. Such <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologers</a> on the other hand as John Dee (1527-1608), whose life has recently been written by C. F. Smith (1909), William Lily (1602-1681), and John Gadbury (1627-1704), seem to have been sincere believers in their own strange <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and that curious character, Valentine Greatrakes (1629-1683), was not a mere charlatan but undoubtedly possessed some natural gift of healing. More to our purpose are a number of feigned or deluded <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstaticas</a> who often traded upon the popular credulity in countries like <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> that were ready to welcome the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Amongst the most famous of these was Magdalena de la Cruz (1487-1560), a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, who for many years was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. She was believed to have the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a> and to take no other food than the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was said to fly to her tongue from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was giving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, and it seemed at such moments that she was raised from the ground. The same <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> levitation took place during her <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> at which time also she was radiant with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light. So universal was the popular veneration, that ladies of the highest rank, when about to be confined, sent to her the cradles or garments prepared for the expected child, that she might <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> them. This was done by the Empress Isabel, in 1527, before the birth of Philip II. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a> had always regarded her with suspicion. Falling dangerously ill in 1543, Magdalena confessed to a long career of <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, ascribing most of the marvels to the action of demons by which she was possessed, but maintaining their reality. She was sentenced by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, in an <em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em> at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, in 1546, to perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of her order, and there she is believed to have ended her days most piously amid marks of the sincerest repentance (see G&ouml;rres, "Mystik", V, 168-174; Lea, "Chapters from Relig. Hist. of Spain", 330-335). A large number of similar cases have been discussed in considerable detail by Lea both in his "Chapters" just cited, and also in the fourth volume of his "History of the Inquisition of Spain", but Lea, though indefatigable as a compiler, is not to be relied on in the conclusions and inferences he draws.

<p>One Italian impostor at this period, who achieved a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> reputation, was Joseph Francis Borro or Borri (1627-1695). In consequence of some crime committed in his dissolute youth, he had taken sanctuary in a church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There he pretended to be converted, and to have received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a mission as a reformer. He had revelations about the Trinity, and declared that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had appointed him to be <em>Generalissimo</em> of an army, which in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to exterminate all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He also maintained that the Blessed Virgin was divinely and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> conceived, that she was, consequently, of the same nature as her Son and present with Him in the Blessed Eucharist. Borro was arrested by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and sentenced in 1661, but he managed to escape and travelled in many parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He seems to have lent himself entirely to a career of vulgar <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, and amongst his other victims he obtained considerable sums of money from Queen Christina of Sweden (this was before her reception into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), upon the pretext of making researches to discover the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> stone. Eventually he gravitated back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was there arrested, and died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1695 (see Cant&ugrave;, "Eretici d'Italia", III, 330). It is also hardly to be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that in consequence of the witch-finding mania which prevailed in both the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, during the last half of the sixteenth and the greater part of the seventeenth century, as well as the exaggerated <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in demoniacal possession current during the same period, the minds of many weak, vicious, or designing <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were fascinated by the supposed possibilities of intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in a more or less visible shape. How much credit is to be attached to the confessions undoubtedly made by many of those accused of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>, it seems impossible to decide. Neither is it easy to arrive at the real facts in such criminal indictments as that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Louis Gauffridi, burnt for his <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">satanical</a> practices and his immoral relations with the "convulsionnaires" in the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sainte-Baume, near <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, in 1611, that of the pretended <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatica</a>, Madeleine Bavent, who upon similar charges was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> with her confessor at Louviers, in 1647, or that of Urbain Grandier, the necromancer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, supposed to have cast a spell over the possessed <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Loudun in the time of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>. These and similar stories, which have been exploited again and again in such prurient and anti-religious works as Michelet's "La Sorci&egrave;re", from an historical point of view still remain shrouded in an almost impenetrable obscurity. On the other hand few will now venture to identify themselves with that unquestioning acceptance of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">satanic</a> and demoniacal phenomena which is to be found in the fourth and fifth volumes of G&ouml;rres's "Mystik". The dangers of excessive credulity of this kind have been too lamentably brought home to our own generation by the outrageous impostures of "L&eacute;o Taxil" to be readily forgotten. At present the tendency of historians is to detect deliberate <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, not so much perhaps in the sorcerers themselves, as in the pretended <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitions</a> of such "witch-finders" as Matthew Hopkins, who in the years 1645-1646 tortured hundreds of miserable victims in East Anglia, under the pretext of finding witch-marks, a procedure which generally ended in their condemnation and death. It is pitiable that the most devout <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformist</a> leaders, men like Baxter and Calamy, regarded Hopkins as the inspired agent of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> in this work.

<p>Towards the close of the seventeenth century, the discovery of the supposed Popish Plot occasioned an epidemic of malicious impostures in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for more than a hundred years previously had let loose a tribe of spies who, passing from side to side, as fear or interest suggested, scrupled at no form of trickery. In a man like the priest-hunter, Richard Topcliffe (1532-1604), who cruelly tortured <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Father Southwell</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, in his own house, the note of brutality prevailed, but that of treachery and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> was not absent. With Gilbert Gifford (died 1590), the government agent who betrayed <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a> to her doom, the case was reversed. Not only he, but Robert Bruce (died 1602), the Scottish spy and swindler, John Cecil (died 1626), the agent of Burleigh and afterwards the associate of the "Appellant" <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and several others were pitiable rogues prepared at all times to sell themselves to the highest bidder. A little later we have another example of the same type in James Wadsworth (1604-1656), the son of a fervent convert of the same name, who had become in his later years a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. James Wadsworth the younger lived upon the money which he earned by his treacherously acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and their secrets. Whatever may be said of James La Cloche, a supposed natural son of Charles II and for a while a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> scholastic, whose story has recently attracted attention (see Barnes, "The Man of the Mask" and the review, by Andrew Lang, in "The Athen&aelig;um", 26 Dec., 1908), it seems clear that La Cloche and his double were both swindlers, though not of the treacherous order. However, the comparative respite accorded to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the accession of Charles II was also accompanied by a great recrudescence of anti-papal feeling. Two unprincipled scoundrels, Israel Tongue (who, though less clearly culpable than his confederate, cannot have acted in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>) and Titus Oates, a young man whose record was already <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, concocted a scheme to exploit the anti-popery ferment. Oates, to worm himself into the secrets of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, pretended conversion and offered himself to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. He was sent to Valladolid on trial but was soon expelled. Professing repentance he was allowed another trial at St-Omer, but expelled a second time. Coming to Tongue in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, the two, in August, 1678, evolved the details of a wildly extravagant plot which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were supposed to have brought to the verge of execution. All the preposterous details were greedily swallowed by the English populace, and in the panic which ensued some thirty-five victims, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of position, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and others, had their lives sworn away by the grossest <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>. Oates, whom his modern biographer (Seccombe, "Twelve Bad Men", 154) describes as "the bloodiest villain since the world began", found a host of abettors and imitators, amongst whom Thomas Dangerfield, an adventurer who also personated the Duke of Monmouth and claimed <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous gifts of healing</a>, with Stephen Dugdale, William Bedloe, Edward Turberville, and Robert Bolron, were the most conspicuous. Oates soon after became discredited, and in 1685, under James II, he was convicted of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> and punished by floggings of unexampled severity, but under William and Mary his sentence was reversed, and in spite of fresh malpractices he received a large pension from the Government, which he drew until his death in 1705. With Oates in his later years was associated William Fuller (1670-1717), seemingly the inventor of the "warming-pan story" (concerning the birth of James, the Old Pretender) and concocter of fictitious Jacobite plots. He published letters of Mary of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> but was convicted and pilloried.

<p>Another swindler who tried to make money out of the fabrication of pretended Jacobite plots was Robert Young. He succeeded for a while, during that age of intrigue and mistrust, in imposing upon the popular credulity, but he was in the end detected. He was afterwards convicted of coining and executed (1700). Robert Ware the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a>, the author of "Foxes and Firebrands", who has of late years been so thoroughly exposed by <a href="../cathen/02782b.htm">Father Bridgett</a>, traded upon the same prejudices. His more public career began contemporaneously with that of Oates in 1678, and by sheltering himself behind the high reputation of his dead father, Sir James Ware, amongst whose <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> he pretended to discover all kinds of compromising papers, he obtained currency for his forgeries, remaining almost undetected until modern times. Many foul aspersions upon the character of individual <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and also upon some <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>, which have found their way into the pages of respectable historians, are due to the fabrications of "this literary skunk", as <a href="../cathen/02782b.htm">Fr. Bridgett</a> not unjustifiably calls him (see <a href="../cathen/02782b.htm">Bridgett</a>, "Blunders and Forgeries", pp. 209-296). Some other vindictive and unprincipled scoundrels whose impostures for the most part took a literary form may also be mentioned here, though without any hope of exhausting the list. Foremost among them comes the Abb&eacute; Zahorowski, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> expelled from his order in which as a young scholastic he had been guilty of certain mean and discreditable tricks. In revenge for his expulsion he contrived to write and publish the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> "Monita Secreta", which, as a code of secret instructions issued by authority, pretended to lay bare the shameless and <a href="../cathen/09501a.htm">Machiavellian</a> policy followed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. That the "Monita Secreta" are a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> is now universally admitted even by opponents, and since the publication of the memoirs of Father Wielewicki (Scriptores Rerum Polonicarum, vols. VII, X, XIV) no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> remains that Zahorowski was the author (see Duhr, "Jesuitenfabeln" No. 5; Brou, "Les J&eacute;suites de la L&eacute;gende", I, 281). Hardly less dear to the no-popery champion than the "Monita Secreta" is the fictitious "Hungarian Confession" or "Fluchformular". It is a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> supposed to have been exacted of converts to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (c. 1676), by which among other things they were required to declare that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ought to receive Divine honours, and that the Blessed Virgin ought to be held higher than Christ himself. The <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> seems to have been traced to the door of George Lani, an Evangelical minister, sent to the galleys for political intrigues against the Government in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, who first published it in a work called "Captivitas Papistica". Whether it was his own fabrication is not, however, certain. He may possibly have adopted, seriously and in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, some satirical composition in circulation at the time (see Duhr, "Jesuitenfabeln", No. 7, and S. F. Smith in "The Month", July-August, 1896).

<p>Such satirical compositions have often been taken seriously. An example is the "Letter of the Three Bishops", which, though written by an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> character, Peter Paul Vergerius (1554), and professing to be a letter of advice given by three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to help to strengthen the power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, is obviously a skit rather than a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. But his letter has been quoted as authentic by hundreds of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversialists from <a href="../cathen/04467a.htm">Crashaw</a> downwards (see Lewis "The Letter of the Three Bishops"). Of the same type is an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> supposed to have been granted by <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a> to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unrepented of, a document really derived from a burlesque Latin drama (see "The Month", July, 1905, p. 96); but <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of the most flagrant type was often used, as, for example, by the ex-Capuchin Father Norbert Parisot, later called Platel, who in the time of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> wrote a book of memoirs on the Jesuit missions, professing to incorporate authentic documents, for the most part fabricated by himself. He afterwards left his order, went to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and is suspected to have fabricated the religious effusions which were made the pretext for burning Father Walafrida. as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in 1761 (see Brou, "Les J&eacute;suites de la L&eacute;gende", II, 82).

<p>In the encouragement of the crowd of impostors who flourished at the beginning of the eighteenth century many leading members of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> episcopate, notably Archbishop Tenison, Bishops Compton of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and White Kennett of <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, were conspicuous. A whole tribe of <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> and French "proselytes" (i.e. seceders from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>) were welcomed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with open arms; but the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">frauds</a> and immoralities of these men, many of which were brought to light in the recriminations of the famous "Bangor Controversy" (a name derived from Hoadly, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bangor, the patron of de la Pilloni&egrave;re, an ex-Jesuit who played a principal part in the fray), would suffice to fill a volume. It seems plain that such converts to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> as Malard, Rouire, and Fournier, despite the eminence of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patrons, were thorough-going scoundrels (see Thurston, "Weeds from the Pope's Garden", in "The Month", Feb., 1897). For example, the last named, obtaining Bishop Hoadly's signature on a scrap of paper, wrote over it a promissory note for &pound;8000 and sued the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the money. When the claim was resisted, Fournier, an ex-priest, impudently declared that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when in his cups had signed the note and given it to him in payment of a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. But even at this stage, Fournier, strong in his denunciations of popery, found supporters against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The same was conspicuously the case with the ex-Jesuit, Archibald Bower, who published in 1743 a most scurrilous "History of the Popes" and mendaciously <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> his former co-religionists. He was ardently taken up by eminent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and statesmen, but his insincerity in the end became so patent that he was exposed and denounced by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, John Douglas, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> (see Pollen in "The Month", Sept., 1908). More nearly corresponding to the ordinary type of impostor was the famous Psalmanazar (1679-1763), a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in childhood by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who coming to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> pretended to be a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> from Formosa, and professed himself a convert to <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a>, winning favour by abusing the Jesuits. He was warmly encouraged by Bishop Compton, to whom he presented a Catechism in "Formosan", a purely fictitious language. Afterwards he fell into poverty and disrepute, confessed the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, and is said to have been sincerely repentant, being visited by Dr. Johnson in his last days. His accomplice and mentor Innes, an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, before the cheat was detected was rewarded by being made chaplain-general of the English forces in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>.

<p>Passing over a certain number of religious enthusiasts who may in various degrees have been self-convinced and who range from the crazy hallucinations of Joanna Southcott (died 1814), who believed she was to bring forth the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>, or of Richard Brothers, the Divinely-crowned descendant of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> and ruler of the world (c. 1792), to the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracle-working</a> claims of Anna Lee (died. 1784), the foundress of the American Shakers, we will pause only to say a word of Joseph Smith (1805-1844), the first apostle of <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormonism</a>. It cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that this man, who after a dissolute youth professed to have visions of a golden book, consisting of metal plates inscribed with strange characters, which he dug for and found, was a deliberate impostor. Smith pretended to decipher and translate these mystic writings, after which the "Book of Mormon" was taken back to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. The translation was printed, but a flood of revelations was still vouchsafed to the seer. Followers, who adopted the name of "The Latter Day Saints", gathered round him, and after some rather brutal treatment in Missouri provoked by their <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> and other doctrines, the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> finally settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. In this State Joseph Smith and Hyrum his brother were lynched on 27 June, 1844, amid circumstances of great barbarity. A revulsion of feeling followed, and Brigham Young, Smith's successor, achieved a corresponding success when he transferred the headquarters of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> (see Lynn, "Story of the Mormons"; and Nelson, "Scientific aspects of Mormonism"). An English analogue of <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormonism</a> was afforded by the Agapemonists from 1848 onward, who under their founder, H. S. Prince, combined a fantastic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a reincarnation of the Deity in Prince and his successors with the grossest laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. But leaving out of account the class of criminal impersonations for motives of gain (like that of Arthur Orton in the celebrated Tichborne case, where the pretender, we may note, seriously damaged his case by his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the life and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practice of the Jesuit College of Stonyhurst in which Roger Tichborne was brought up), anti-Catholic prejudice is still responsible for a large proportion of modern impostures. Famous among these are the supposed revelations of Maria Monk, who professed to have been a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> for some years in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and who published in 1835 a wild and often self-contradictory story of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> and immoralities supposed to be committed there by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Though this narrative was fully refuted from the very first by unimpeachable <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> testimony, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that during the period of Maria Monk's alleged residence in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> she was leading the life of a prostitute in the city, and though this disproof has been in a hundred ways confirmed by later evidence, the "Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk" is a book still sold and circulated by various <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. Maria Monk died (1849) in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where she had been confined as a common pickpocket (see "The True History of Maria Monk", <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Truth Soc. pamphlet, Lond., 1895).

<p>Not less famous is the case of Dr. Achilli, an ex-Dominican and anti-popery lecturer, whose long career of debauchery, first as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and then as a pretended convert to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, Dr. (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> exposed in 1852. In the <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a> action which Achilli was forced to bring, a verdict was given against <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> on certain counts, but almost the whole <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> press of the country described the trial as a gross miscarriage of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Achilli's credit was in consequence completely destroyed. In the case of many of these purveyors of "awful revelations" on both sides of the Atlantic, the previous record of the lecturer is of the most <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> kind. The men calling themselves "ex-monk Widdows" and "James Ruthven", as well as the "escaped nun", Edith O'Gorman, may also be specially mentioned in this connexion. Hardly more creditable is the history of Pastor Chiniquy (1809-1899), who for many years denounced in highly prurient books and pamphlets, notably that called "The Priest, the Woman and the Confessional", the alleged abuses of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is admitted that he had been twice suspended by two different <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before he seceded from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and there is no room to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that these <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspensions</a> were motived by grave moral lapses of which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in question had full and convincing information, though, as often happens in such cases, the girls he had seduced could not be persuaded to face the exposure involved by substantiating the charge publicly upon <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Certain it is that, while in his early books after leaving the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he makes no charge against the moral character of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> but rather on the contrary attributes his change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> considerations, in his later works, notably his "Fifty years in the Church of Rome" (1885), he represents himself as forced to relinquish <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> by the appalling <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> he had witnessed (see S. F. Smith's "Pastor Chiniquy", <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Truth Soc. pamphlet, Lond., 1908). But by that time he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> public demanded, while all who could effectively confute his statements were dead.

<p>Of a different type is the most <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> imposture of modern times, that of "L&eacute;o Taxil" and "Diana. Vaughan". L&eacute;o Taxil, whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name was G. Jogand-Pag&egrave;s, had long been known as one of the most blasphemous and obscene of the anti-clerical writers in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He had been repeatedly sentenced to fines and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for the filthy and libellous works he published. For example, on account of his atrocious book Les Amours de Pie IX" he was sentenced to pay 60,000 francs at the suit of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> nephew. He had also founded the "Anti-Clerical", a journal which fanatically attacked all revelation and religion. In 1885 it was announced that L&eacute;o Taxil had been converted, and he soon proceeded to publish a series of pretended exposures of the practices of <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a>, and particularly of the "Satanisme" or <a href="../cathen/04767a.htm">Devil-worship</a> with which he declared it was intimately bound up. Amongst other attractions he introduced a certain "Diana Vaughan", the heroine of "Palladism", who was destined to be the spouse of the demon <a href="../cathen/01792c.htm">Asmodeus</a>, but clung to virtue, and was constantly visited by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>. Various other writers, Bataille, Margiotta, Hacks, etc., exploited the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and became in a measure Taxil's confederates. In 1896-1897 the imposture was finally shown up and Taxil cynically admitted that Diana Vaughan was only the name of his typist. [See Portali&eacute;, "La Fin d'une mystification", Paris, 1897, and H. Gruber (H. Gerber), "Leo Taxils Palladismus Roman", and other works, 1897-8.] Of Dr. Dowie, who professed to represent a second coming on earth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elias, and of his followers the "Zionists", of the Christian Scientists, of the late Madame Blavatsky and A. P. Sinnett, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of Esoteric <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, of Mrs. Annie Besant and the believers in reincarnation, there is no need to say more here than that the existence of such cults proves conclusively that the age of credulity is not yet over.
