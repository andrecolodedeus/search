<h1>In C&oelig;na Domini</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, so called from the feast on which it was annually published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, viz, the feast of the Lord's Supper, or <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> took place in the loggia of St. Peter's in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, and the Roman Court. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was read first in Latin by an auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Sacred Roman Rota</a>, and then in Italian by a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a>. When the reading was over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> flung a lighted waxen torch into the piazza beneath. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> contained a collection of censures of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the perpetrators of various offences, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from which was reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The custom of periodical publication of censures is an old one. The tenth canon of the Council of York (1195) orders all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to publish censures of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurers</a> with bell and lighted candle thrice in the year. The Council of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1200) commands the yearly publication of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against sorcerers, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurers</a>, incendiaries, thieves, and those guilty of rape. The first list of censures of the "Bulla C&oelig;n&aelig;" appeared in the fourteenth century, and was added to and modified as time went on, until its final revision under <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in the year 1627, after which it remained practically unchanged till its formal abrogation in the last century. Under <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> (1363) the list contained seven cases; under <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> (1372) nine; under <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1420) ten; under <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> (1511) twelve: under <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (1536) seventeen; under <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (1577) twenty, and under the <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">same pontiff</a> in the year 1583 twenty-one; under <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (1606 and 1619) twenty; and the same number in the final shape given to it by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. The main heads of the offences struck with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> are as follows: <ul><li>(1) Apostasy, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. <li>(2) Appeals from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. <li>(3) Piracy in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> seas. <li>(4) Plundering shipwrecked vessels, and seizure of flotsam and jetsam. <li>(5) The imposition of new tolls and taxes, or the increase of old ones in cases where such was not allowed by law or by permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <li>(6) The falsification of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Briefs and Bulls</a>. <li>(7) The supply of arms, ammunition or War-material to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, or other enemies of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. <li>(8) The hindering of the exportation of food and other commodities to the seat of the Roman court. <li>(9) Violence done to travellers on their way to and from the Roman court. <li>(10) Violence done to <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. <li>(11) Violence done to <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, etc, <li>(12) Violence done to those who were treating matters with the Roman court. <li>(13) Appeals from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> to secular courts. <li>(14) The avocation of spiritual causes from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> to lay courts. <li>(15) The subjection of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to lay courts. <li>(16) The molestation of ecclesiastical judges. <li>(17) The usurpation of church goods, or the sequestration of the same without leave of the proper <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. <li>(18) The imposition of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and taxes on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> without special leave of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <li>(19) The interference of lay judges in capital or criminal causes of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. <li>(20) The invasion, occupation, or usurpation of any part of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>.</ul>

<p>There was a clause in the older editions of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, ordering all <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to see to its regular publication in their spheres of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but this was not carried out, as we learn from a letter of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> to the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The efforts of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to bring about its solemn publication in every part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were foiled by the opposition of the reigning powers. Philip II, in the year 1582, expelled the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> from his kingdom for attempting to publish the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Its publication was forbidden in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Rudolf II (1576-1612) likewise opposed it. In spite of the opposition of princes it was known to the faithful through <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> rituals, provincial chapters of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of jubilees. Confessors were often ordered to have a copy of it in their possession; <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> had a copy of it posted up in every confessional in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> its solemn publication took place year after year, on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, until 1770, when it was omitted by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> and never again resumed.

<p>A widespread and growing opposition to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogatives in the eighteenth century, the works of <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a> and Pereira, favouring the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> of the State, eventually resulted in a general attack on the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. A very few of its provisions were rooted in the old <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could effectually champion the cause of the oppressed, and by his spiritual power remedy evils, with which temporal rulers were powerless or unwilling to deal. They had outlived their time. The <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Ferdinand, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> on 30 January, 1768, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the signal for a storm of opposition against the <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in almost all the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states. Joseph I of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> issued an edict on 2 April, 1768, declaring it treason to print, or sell, or distribute, or make any judicial reference to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Similar edicts followed in the same year from Ferdinand IV of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, the Prince of Monaco, the free states of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Teresa</a>, Empress of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, to her subjects in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> followed the lead of his mother, and on 14 April, 1781, he, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>-like, informed his subjects that "the power of absolving from the cases reserved in the 'Bulla C&oelig;n&aelig;', which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had hitherto given in the so-called quinquennial faculties, was now and henceforth entirely withdrawn". On 4 May of the same year he ordered the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> to be struck out of the rituals, and no more use to be made of it. In 1769 appeared Le Bret's well-known attack on the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in four volumes, under the title "Pragmatische Geschichte der so berufenen Bulle in Coena Domini, und ihrer f&uuml;rchterlichen Folgen f&uuml;r Staat und Kirche" (Frankfort, 1769). Towards the end of the work he appeals to the humanity, wisdom, and magnanimity of the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a>, <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, to suppress it. Clement, who already as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had expressed his view as to the necessity of living in peace and harmony with the heads of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> states, omitted its publication, but did not formally abrogate it. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> had inserted a clause in it, which stated that it would continue to have the force of law until the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should substitute another in its place. In the quinquennial faculties delivered to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> continued to grant power to absolve from its cases. This was done so late as 1855 by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. For these reasons <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists commonly held that the main provisions of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> were still in force. Nevertheless, there was good ground for supposing that the few obnoxious clauses that had outlived their purpose, and in the changed times were no longer applicable to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, had ceased to have any binding force. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was formally abrogated by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> through the issue of the new Constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis"</a>, in which the censures against piracy, against appropriating shipwrecked goods, against supplying infidels with war-material, and against the levying of new tolls and taxes find no place. In the preamble to the Constitution the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> remarks that, with altered times and customs, certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures no longer fulfilled their original purpose, and had ceased to be useful or opportune.

<p>In the controversies that arose at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> about <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In C&oelig;na Domini" was dragged to the front, and Janus said of it that if any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> bears the stamp of an ex cathedra decision it must surely be this one, which was confirmed again and again by so many <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, afterwards made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at the same time as <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, had no difficulty in showing in his "Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and Christian State" the absurdity of this assertion.
