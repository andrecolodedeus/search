<h1>Incardination and Excardination</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>cardo,</em> a pivot, socket, or hinge--hence, <em>incardinare,</em> to hang on a hinge, or fix; <em>excardinare,</em> to unhinge, or set free).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sense the words are used to denote that a given <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is freed from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and is transferred to that of another. The term <em>cardinare</em> is used by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> (596-604), and <em>incardinare,</em> in the sense of inscribing a name on the list or <em><a href="../cathen/10052a.htm">matricula</a></em> of a church, is found in the ancient <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a> of the Roman chancery. Excardination is the full and perpetual transference of a given <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to that of another. Incardination is canonical and perpetual enlistment in the new diocese to which a given <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has been transferred by letters of excardination. It must be remembered that in canon law a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> belongs to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in any one or more of the four following ways: by birth, by <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, by domicile, or by service. In accordance with this the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always maintained the principle that excardination cannot be forced upon a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unwilling to accept it, nor at the same time can it be withheld unless there exist a just reason. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> is most clear in its legislation on these matters, as will be seen from the following: "Whereas no one ought to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, who, in the judgment of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is not useful or <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his churches, the Holy Synod, in the spirit of what was enjoined by the sixth canon of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, ordains that no one shall for the future be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> without being attached to that church, or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> place, for the need or utility of which he is promoted, where he shall discharge his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and may not wander about without any certain abode. And if he shall quit that place without having consulted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he shall be <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a> from the exercise of his Sacred orders. Furthermore, no cleric, who is a stranger, shall, without letters commendatory from his own ordinary, be admitted by any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to celebrate the Divine mysteries and to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>" (Sess. XXIII, "De Ref.", cap. xvi). "The Holy Synod ordains that henceforth no secular cleric . . . shall be promoted to Sacred orders unless it be first legitimately certain that he is in the peaceful possession of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> sufficient for his honest livelihood; and he shall not be able to resign that <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, without mentioning that he was promoted under the title thereof; nor shall that resignation be received, unless it be certain that he can live suitably from other resources at his disposal; and any resignation made otherwise shall be null" (Sess. XXI, "De Ref.", cap. ii).

<p>From these decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> canonists deduce that for excardination to be lawful there must exist a just cause. Moreover, letters of excardination are absolutely valueless unless at the same time there is a corresponding incardination into another diocese, lest the cleric wander about "ovis quasi perdita et errans" (Decret. Grat., can. i, dist. 72). Many decrees of the Congregation of the Council assert this (S.C.C., 5 Sept., 1818; 14 Dec., 1822; 26 Jan., 1833; 20 July, 1898; <a href="../cathen/02711e.htm">Bouix</a>, "De Episcopo", pt. V, c. xxiv, 4). Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, may not leave the diocese to which they belong. Moreover, if they have not been appointed to any specific work in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may order them to remain in the diocese even though they be unwilling to do so (S.C.C., as above). He must, however, have a just cause for his action, and make provision for the decent support of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> thus retained (Bargilliat, 1907, no. 607). If a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> wishes to enter a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has no power to refuse letters of excardination; they are not granted, however, until the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> has been completed. If before that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> such a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is to receive orders, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will grant him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> dismissorial letters. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot incardinate a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> verbally. The canonical effect is obtained only when the incardination is granted in writing, absolutely and perpetually. There must not be any limitations either expressed or tacit; so that a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is absolutely enlisted in his new diocese and takes the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> similar to that prescribed by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> in the Constitution "Speculatores" (1694) for acquiring a new domicile (S.C.C., 20 July, 1898). Further, the incardination is not accomplished unless the cleric presents a legally executed document which sets forth that the cleric has been released perpetually from his former diocese, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of which gives testimony (secretly if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>) as to the subject's birth, life, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and studies. When the above conditions have been complied with, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> after they have been transferred may be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, although it is recommended that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should give a further trial before <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposing hands</a> upon his new subject. In general the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares, he should ordain no one, except for the need or convenience of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (Sess. XXIII, "De Ref.", c. xvi). A greater amount of supervision is required when it is question of incardinating a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> from a foreign country or speaking a foreign tongue. There is a grave <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to inquire most strictly as to their life from their former ordinaries (S.C.C., 20 July, 1898). Clerics and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who do not wish to use the benefits of excardination are bound by the aforesaid Constitution "Speculatores". In connection with excardination and incardination, it is generally accepted now that the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> has no power to grant perpetual letters of excardination, nor can he receive a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> into the diocese in perpetuity, but for a time he may do either in any cases which present themselves during his period of office ("Clement.", I: "De h&aelig;ret.", <a href="../cathen/12724c.htm">Reiffenstuel</a> ad tit. "Ne sede vacante", n. 77).

<p>In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> special legislation on this subject has become <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in various countries. The following is a brief resum&eacute; of the same. Where <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <em>ad titulum missionis</em> they are bound thereby not only to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but to the province also, "so that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> thus <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> may, with the consent of both ordinaries, be transferred from one diocese into another merely by conferring a fresh title without the necessity of taking a fresh <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>". In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> a three years' trial is recommended before such transfer be made. The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> a three years' trial (or even five, but no more) for a strange <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, unless the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of both <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> should agree to the immediate reception of the applicant. This is called by the council <em>formal</em> incardination. If, after the lapse of this period, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does not formally reject the applicant, he is legally presumed to have accepted him (nos. 63, 66). This council also reminds all ordinaries of the special rules to be observed in the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who have taken the "mission oath", and of members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders desirous of joining a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (nos. 64, 65; <em>cf.</em> Cong. Prop., 30 Nov., 1885, and 17 April, 1871). To obtain uniformity of action, the council recommends that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> use an identical printed formula for excardination and incardination. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of the Council (14 Nov., 1903) concerns <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clerics</a> who wish to go to North America or the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. It again calls attention to a circular sent to the American and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1890, which instructed the latter not to allow their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to America unless they have an excellent record, concerning their previous ministry, are of mature age, are likely to edify by their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and also are able to assign a valid and serious reason for leaving home. This circular now applies to all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who propose to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to America or the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, or even to make prolonged visits to those countries without the consent of the congregation. In case of real and urgent necessity the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can only grant permission for absence during six months, and in each case they are bound to inform the congregation of the permission given. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> have lately adopted the same precautions. In the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (no. 69) the Fathers approve of the custom of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> having an abundant supply of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, lending to more needy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> some of such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but such transfers to be of a temporary nature. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> approved the custom of the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The councils of Westminster contain a command received from <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and imposed upon all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in missionary countries and also prefects and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, that without any hesitation they require strange <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to present commendatory letters from their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Those who have them not are in no way to be received. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who wishes to leave the diocese to which he is attached must be furnished with a letter of excorporation, i.e. excardination (commonly called an <em>exeat</em>) from his ordinary, and no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can aggregate to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> any strange <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is not possessed of such letter (First Synod of Westminster, no. 19, c. vii). Further, no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall ordain a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> born in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without a testimonial or dimissorial letter from that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This rule should be observed also in the case of converts who wish to enter the sacred ministry. For the special rules which govern the sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> belonging to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, see the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the S. Cong. of the Council, 22 Dec., 1894, and the instruction of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 6 Aug, 1905.
