<div id="springfield2">
<h1>India</h1>  

<p>In popular language the name "India", in its widest extension, is taken to include British India proper, Native States, Portuguese and French India, <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, and Ceylon, and is even sometimes stretched to include Indo-China. In its strictest sense, however, it means the Indian Empire properly so-called. The Indian Empire, as at present constituted, comprises (besides the peninsula) Burma, Aden, the Laccadive, Maldive, Andaman, and Nicobar Islands, but does not include Ceylon, which is a Crown colony politically distinct. Its total area exceeds 1,800,000 square miles &#151; fifteen times that of the United Kingdom, nearly one &#151; sixth of the area of the whole British Empire, and three- quarters of the area of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. About 1,000,000 square miles are directly under British rule, the rest consisting of Native States and Agencies and the small possessions of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The greatest length, from Kashmir to Cape Comorin, is 2,022 miles, and the greatest breadth, from Eastern Burma to Karachi, 2,520 miles. The land frontier measures about 6,000, and the coast line about 9,000, miles. It will be useful at the outset to point out the impossibility of forming one united conception of anything connected with India. It is not a country but rather a continent, comprising such a variety of physical features, climates, seasons, products, races, <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, customs, and languages as to require an encyclopedia by itself. Nor can any amount of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> gathered in one part of this immense territory be taken as applicable without qualification to another.
<h2>Physical features</h2>

<p>The peninsula is separated on the north from <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a> and Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> by the Himalaya, <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> Kush, and Karakoram mountains, and some lower ranges divide it from Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Attached to the Bombay Presidency is a certain portion of Baluchistan bordering on the Afghan frontier. Within its general boundaries there are several small portions of territory belonging to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, having their centres of government at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and Pondicherry respectively. In point of contour, Bengal, Sind, Rajputana, and the Punjab are flat, being formed by the alluvium of the Ganges and Indus respectively. The rest of the peninsula is roughly speaking a plateau rising abruptly at the western edge and gradually sloping down to the east coast. As a consequence the watershed line is generally at the summit of the western Ghats, 30 to 100 miles from the west coast. From this point a few small rivers run their short course to the Arabian Sea, but the greater ones rise in the heart of the Ghats and run across the whole peninsula, increasing in volume as they progress, and empty their waters into the Gulf of Bengal (Mahanadi, Godaveri, Kistna, Kaveri, etc.). In the more northerly parts, however, the plateau recedes inland, and here two rivers of considerable size (Tapti and Nerbudda) run into the Arabian Sea. The average level of the Deccan plateau is under 2,000 feet; but it contains many ranges and isolated mountains rising over 4,000 feet, chiefly along the western edge, and there are still higher parts in the Mysore and neighbouring districts, where the highest point is 8,840 feet above sea level. The coast is for the most part flat and straight, with a considerable number of small indentations suitable for small craft; but there are very few large harbours: Karachi (mostly artificial), <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, and Marmagoa are the only ones which are practicable on the west side, while on the east there is not a single one, Madras harbour being purely artificial, and Calcutta over 100 miles up the River Hooghly. The climate is on the whole dry and rainless for two-thirds of the year, during which time crops are possible only by means of irrigation. The rainy season (called the monsoon) occupies the remaining four months but differs on the two sides of the country. On the western coast it lasts from June to September, while on the east coast it occurs from October to December &#151; in each case the rain being borne on to the land by the sea breeze. The rainfall on the western coast strip is about 70 inches, while on the Ghat line it sometimes rises to 300, but falls in the interior to 30, 20, and even less than 10 inches. In the northern parts and on the east coast the rainfall is less, while in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> districts of Sind, Rajputana, etc. it is very scanty. About the Himalayas the conditions approach more nearly to those of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. One-half of the latitude of India falls within the tropics. Ice and snow are entirely unknown except in the high altitudes, and hail is rare and phenomenal. The temperature, which varies much locally, falls in the aggregate rarely lower than 50&#176; and rise in parts as high as 120&#176; in the shade. In the tropical portions there are two hot seasons, the one before and the other after the rains (May and October). With due precautions against exposure to the sun, avoidance of chills, a carefully adjusted diet and judiciously regulated exercise, <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> find the country on the whole healthy though enervating; but any weakness in the constitution is more likely to reveal itself there than at home, especially among men who go out after the prime of life. The people as a whole are of a mild and inoffensive character, and obsequious to the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a>; and except for a chance of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> among the remote hill tribes, the traveller is everywhere as safe as he would be in any part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>India is covered over with a network of railways, along which the chief business centres and the chief objects of interest for the traveller are situated &#151; the rest being accessible by journeys of a few miles by <em>tonga</em> along decent roads. Except in the cities much frequented by <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> hotels are scarce; but refreshment rooms and even sleeping rooms are found in the more important railway stations, otherwise resort must be had to "travellers' bungalows", in some of which food can be obtained by previous notice. In Native States respectable <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> are accepted as guests of the State, and guest-houses are provided for them. In other remote districts resident <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> officials can be relied upon for incidental hospitality in case of emergency. In a few large cities such as Calcutta, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, and Karachi, <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> commodities of every kind are obtainable, and the social and domestic life differs in no way from that at home. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to a more limited extent in towns occupied as military stations. Elsewhere it is generally impossible even to obtain anything so <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> as a loaf of bread, except at the refreshment room of the station, if there is one.

<p>One of the peculiarities of Indian life is the hill stations, "suburban towns" they might be called, to which those who have the opportunity flock from the plains in the hot seasons, and occasionally at other times, to recover from the enervating influence of the plains. For instance Darjeeling, <a href="../cathen/13796a.htm">Simla</a>, Mussourie, Murree, Nainital, etc., on the slopes of the Himalayas; Mount Abu in Rajputana; Khandalla, <a href="../cathen/12235b.htm">Poona</a>, Matheran, and Mahableshwar, in the western Ghats; Bangalore, <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a>, and Conoor, in the Mysore hills; Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>.


<h2>Population and language</h2>

<p>According to the census of 1901 the total population of the Indian Empire amounted to 294,361,056, of which 62,461,549 belong to the Native States, and 231,899,507 to strictly British territory. The whole of this population is divided racially as follows: (1) The Aryans, mostly in Northern India and the Deccan, about 221 millions or nearly three-fourths of the total; (2) The Dravidian races of Southern India, about sixty millions; (3) The Kolarian aborigines of the Central Provinces, from four to five millions; (4) The Tibeto-Burmese, above eleven millions; (5) <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, a fluctuating figure something over 170,000; (6) Parsees, about 94,000; (7) <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 18,000 &#151; smaller classifications being omitted. The prevailing languages are correspondingly the Aryan (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Gujerathi, Uriya, Sindi, etc.); the Dravidian (Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Canarese); the Kolarian (Santali) and the Tibetan and Burmese. There are also very many minor languages confined to small districts or single tribes. The lingua franca of the country is Hindustani, or Urdu, a mixture of Hindi with Persian and Arabic words, and written in the Arabic or in the Devanagiri character &#151; its prevalence being due to the Mogul domination.
<h2>Political history</h2>

<p>The historical vicissitudes of India have been likened to the waves of the ocean flowing into a shallow bay, one following after another and each obliterating wholly or partially the effects of the preceding. It may also be likened to a kaleidoscope of ever-changing colour and form, as kingdom after kingdom has risen and fallen, coagulated and disintegrated, and as the supremacy has passed from hand to hand. The ancient portion of this history is almost without dates, and even the events themselves are mostly gathered from precarious references. Consequently, as regards origins, even what is certain must from the nature of the case be vague. Down to some unascertainable date (possibly about 1,500 B.C.) India was inhabited partly by the various aboriginal peoples (Kolarians, etc.) whose remnants are still found surviving in the country, and partly by Dravidian immigrants who had superseded these aborigines at some very early period. About that time the great Aryan <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> divided into two sections, one passing southwards into India. This Aryan race in great part held aloof from the people they subjugated, whom they regarded with contempt. But in some degree mixture was inevitable; and thus a large number of local tribes, some pure Aryan, others aboriginal, others mixed, came into existence. When Alexander the Great made his expedition to India in 326 B.C., his sphere of activity did not extend beyond the Sutlej. After his death and the breaking up of his empire, the people of India, under the leadership of a prince of Patna (305 B.C.) forced the Greek invader to relinquish all share in the country. Many of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> were then gradually consolidated into an empire which reached its highest organization under Asoka (272 &#151; 232 B.C.). The empire of Asoka comprised practically the whole of the peninsula except the portion south of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, which was held independently by the more ancient Chola, Pandya, Chera, and Satuja dynasties. Soon after Asoka's death, his kingdom broke up into several smaller ones bearing the names of Kalinga, Andhra, Malwa, and Magadha, besides numbers of minor states. Early in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era fresh Scythian hordes poured into India and founded the Kushan Empire, which comprised the whole north &#151; west down to the Vindhya Mountains. This empire reached the summit of power under King Kanishka, the great patron of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> who ruled about A.D. 120. By the fourth century A.D. the Guptas and the Western satraps rose in importance, and divided the supremacy between them till the latter were swallowed up by the former. The Gupta Empire lasted till the end of the fifth century A.D. when it was destroyed by a Mongol tribe, called the White Huns. In the sixth century the White Huns were overcome by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> and by <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> tribes, and their hold on India fell before a confederacy of Indian princes under the King of Magadha. In the beginning of the seventh century there existed two supremacies &#151; that of the north under a king of Thaneshwar, and that of the south in the hands of the Chalukyas, with the River Nerbudda as the boundary between them. These organizations soon fell to pieces, and for several centuries India became once more a congress of petty chieftaincies.

<p>The next foreign invaders were the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> of Afghanistan, who gradually took possession of the northern half of the peninsula, while in the south the supremacy of the Chalukyas was succeeded by that of the Cholas. In the fourteenth century the Afghan Empire had expanded over almost the whole of the country, the chieftaincies of Kashmir, Orissa, Kutch, Junagarh, and the Comorin Coast alone retaining independence. But there was a constant tendency among the various provinces of this empire to throw off the yoke, in which for the most part they succeeded. In the fourteenth century the country south of the Kistna was held by the Indian princes with their capital at Vijayanagar, while north of this the Bahmani kingdom, and those of Malwa, Gondwana, Telingana, Behar, Bengal, Jaunpur, etc., were in various degrees independent of the Afghan dominion of Delhi. Two hundred years later the Afghan empire had shrunk up towards the Himalayas and was fringed round with more or less independent kingdoms which now included Rajputana, Sind, Multan, Gujerat, Malwa, Gondwana, Khandesh, Berar, Bidar, Golconda, Ahmednagar, Bijapur, etc. The year 1526 marks the entrance into India of the Moguls, who under the famous Akbar (1556-1605) finally broke the Afghan power and set up the Mogul supremacy in its place. The empire of Akbar comprised the provinces of Kabul, <a href="../cathen/08742c.htm">Lahore</a>, Multan, Delhi, <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, Oudh, <a href="../cathen/01316b.htm">Allahabad</a>, Ajmere, Gujerat, Malwa, Behar, Bengal, Khandesh, Berar, Ahmednagar, Orissa, Sind, and Kashmir, the southern boundary being roughly speaking marked by the River Godaveri and the latitude of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. South of this extended the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> sultanates of Ahmednagar, Bidar, Golconda, and Bijapur, south of which lay their enemy, the Indian confederacy of Vijayanagar. The latter power was irrecoverably defeated by the former in the battle of Talikot (1565). The barrier which had withstood the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> power for three centuries was thus removed; and this prepared the way to an extension southwards as far as Mysore &#151; the sway of the southern princes having now declined so as to become almost negligible. But these victorious <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> sultans were in turn attacked from the rear by the Mogul power which under Aurung-Zeb (1658 &#151; 1707) swallowed up the Kingdoms of Ahmednagar, Bijapur, and Golconda. But the Mogul supremacy, like all former ones, was incapable of permanency. Besides successful efforts after independence made by the tribes of the north, a new enemy now appeared in the rising power of the Mahrattas (Aryans of the Deccan) who under Sivaji (1627 &#151; 1680) played havoc wherever they went. By 1750 the Mahratta confederacy had extended over the greater part of Central India and the western coast, while the Mogul Empire had been resolved into several kingdoms of which Rajputana, Ahmedabad, Oudh, Behar, Bengal, the Nizam's dominions (Hyderabad &#151; Deccan) were the chief &#151; the Dravidian princes still reigning on the Canarese and Travancore coasts. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Mahratta confederacy had still further extended its range northwards so as to include Rajputana.

<p>Meanwhile various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> powers were gradually securing a footing in the country. First came the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> in 1498, and secured certain strips of the western coast (Goa, Chaul, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/02343a.htm">Bassein</a>, <a href="../cathen/04610a.htm">Dam&atilde;o</a>, Diu). More than a century later the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, sworn enemies of the Portuguese, established themselves in Nagapatam, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, Pulicat, etc., besides wresting Cochin and other portions of territory from the Portuguese. The English East India Company (founded in 1600) soon acquired stations at Sarat, Calicut, Masulipatam, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, and (by cession) Bombay (1661 &#151; 5). Before 1700 the French had secured Masulipatam, <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, and Chandernagore, while at the same time the Danes held Tranquebar and Serampur. In the conflict which followed the Portuguese, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and Danes counted for little, and the two last named powers ultimately lost all footing in the country. The struggle was chiefly between the English and the French, both of whom tried to win the various native princes over by persuasion, treaty, subsidy, or force, and played them off against the opposing power. The growth of the English supremacy was steady but gradual. By the battle of Plassey in 1757 they became virtually masters of Bengal. By 1784 they had secured sway along the east coast (Circars and Carnatic). In 1795 they were dominant in Bengal and Behar, the Circars, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, Carnatic, <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, etc. In 1805 they had reached up the Ganges valley as far as Bellary and along the Kanara coasts. In 1823 British territory reached almost all round the coast from Assam to Gujerat, and extended inwards in such a way that the Native States resembled islands in a sea (Travancore, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a>, Nizam's dominions, Kolhapur, Mahratta States, Rajputana, Oudh, etc). In 1843 Sind was added to the British dominions; in 1849, the Punjab; in 1854, Nagpur; in 1856, Oudh; and in 1885, Burma. Where conquest or cession by treaty did not take place, the Native States were taken under military protection, the British troops stationed in them being an effectual preventative of revolt or foreign alliance. The conquest of India would present an interesting study in ethics, as would most other conquests in the world, but one thing is clear: the history of India before the English supremacy was a history of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, devastation, arbitrary rule, fall of empire upon empire, chaos, and insecurity, while under British rule it has become precisely the opposite. The foregoing sketch, inadequate and incomplete, will suffice to convey a general impression of the whole field; and it will be rendered more intelligible if read with Joppen's "Historical Atlas of India", from which it has chiefly been taken.
<h2>Present political organization</h2>
<h3>British India</h3>

<p>India is at present divided into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> territory, independent Native States, and protected Native States &#151; which latter are in varying degrees under the sway of the supreme executive authority of the Governor &#151; General of India, more commonly known as the viceroy. For purposes of administration the Indian Empire is divided into the nine great provinces of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, Bengal, Eastern Bengal and Assam, United Provinces of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a> and Oudh, the Punjab, <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, Central Provinces and the North &#151; West Frontier Province, under officials variously designated governor, lieutenant &#151; governor and chief commissioner &#151; the minor charges being Coorg, Ajmere &#151; Marwara, British Baluchistan, and the Andaman Islands, each under a chief commissioner.

<p>Of independent States there are only two, Bhutan and Nepul, both in the Himalayas. Of the protected States, Hyderabad (Deccan), Baroda, and Mysore are the most important, while the smaller ones are to a great extent grouped together into Agencies, e.g., Rajputana, Kathiawar, Central India, etc. The chiefs of these protected states retain their own internal administration, but under British supervision, which is exercised sometimes through political agents, in other cases by political residents. The princes have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> or peace, or to send ambassadors to other states, or to maintain a military force beyond a certain specified limit; and the supreme government can exercise any degree of control in case of misgovernment; moreover, some of them are required to pay a fixed annual tribute.
<h3>Portuguese India</h3>

<p>The actual Portuguese possessions at the present time within the peninsula are <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, Dam&atilde;o and Diu. <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> is a tract of picturesque and fertile country on the West Coast about 250 miles south of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, measuring 63 miles in length by 40 miles in breadth. It comprises a nucleus of "old conquests", <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, Bardez, and Salcete (to be distinguished from the Island of Salsette near Bombay); an outer belt of "new conquests"; and the Island of Angediva. The population borders on half a million; the majority are native <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whose ancestors were converted centuries ago. Freedom of religion is tolerated, but no public form of worship other than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is admitted within the "old conquests". <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> is regarded as an integral part of the Portuguese Empire, and (with its two dependencies, Dam&atilde;o and Diu) forms a province subject to a Governor &#151; General. Dam&atilde;o, 100 miles north of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, a fortified Portuguese town with a small outlying district in the interior, has an area of 82 square miles with a total population of over 50,000. Diu is a small fortified island at the southern point of the Kathiawar coast, measuring about 7 miles by 2, with a population of something over 12,000. (For <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> particulars see under <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and damao).
<h3>French India</h3>

<p>The French possessions consist of five settlements. Of these Pondicherry is the chief, having an area of 115 square miles and a population of about 150,000. Next comes Karikol with 53 square miles and 26,000 inhabitants. The rest are much smaller, namely, Chandernagore, near <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, Mahe, on the Malabar coast, and Yanaon, north of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, the total area of French India being 203 square miles, with a total population of about 300,000. In British territory round about Pondicherry, etc., there are also a number of small plots, the sites of former French factories, over which the French possess certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Administration is in the hands of a governor residing at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. (For <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> particulars see Pondicherry, archdiocese of.)
<h2>The government and the people</h2>

<p>There has arisen in India of recent years a wave of national aspiration, which is by some viewed with alarm, and by others with indifference. It originated or first manifested itself by the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1886, which began to hold annual meetings wherein "to give voice to our aspirations and to formulate our wants" (Gokhale in 1905). In 1904 a party &#151; protest against the partition of Bengal was followed by an attempt to force the hand of Government by the <a href="../cathen/16012a.htm">boycott</a> of imported goods in favour of Indian manufactures (Swadeshi movement), which in turn developed into an effort after "national revival". This movement issued in a certain amount of seditious writing, systematic spread of disaffection among the masses, and even resort to anarchistic methods such as the use of bombs, etc. Given that the element of sedition and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is suppressed with a firm hand, the movement does not (in the present writer's opinion) forebode anything like a mutiny, or jeopardize British dominion. But in its constitutional elements, which are based on democratic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> derived from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, it will have to be reckoned with. Viewed in this light, it means that an ever &#151; increasing number of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, who have been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> on English lines and many of them in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, realize keenly their position as British subjects, claim equality with <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> in talent, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and citizenship, seek to be admitted more extensively to Government offices, aim at a representative instead of an autocratic form of government, demand financial autonomy for the country, etc., etc., and are endeavouring to develop public opinion in favour of all these points, first among their own class, then among the community in general. No one can quarrel with this aspiration so long as it is worked on constitutional lines, and in a measure calculated to promote the real welfare of the country. The practical difficulty arises from the fact that while in the eyes of most <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> the country is not yet ripe for such measures, the promoters of the movement either believe that it is ripe, or else that by pushing the matter the country can be made ripe far sooner than if matters are left alone. This seems a fair and moderate view of the movement, putting aside the more extreme tendencies connected with it. With regard to the policy of Government in dealing with the situation, account must be taken of the tendency of the Oriental mind to respect power and to take advantage of good nature. Anything like leniency or long &#151; suffering in dealing with disturbance is in India sure to be taken as a sign of weakness, and hasty endeavours to pacify the people by partially acceding to their demands will only be interpreted as indications of fear, and an encouragement to further agitation. A firm determination, on the part of Government, not even to entertain any <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of concession till all signs of disorder have permanently disappeared, would probably be more effectual than any other measure.

<p>It does not come within the scope of this article to discuss the political situation. Our only concern here is to dispel certain <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> or exaggerated notions as to the relations between Government and people. There does not, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, exist in India much positive patriotism in favour of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> rule; but at the same time neither does there exist anything like a deep or widespread <em>spontaneous</em> indignation. The mass of the people usually confine their interest to the narrow horizon of their own personal wants. They find that contact with <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> brings a great increase to their revenues; and in fact there is a danger of whole classes being spoiled by the lavishness with which, compared with former times, they are remunerated for their services. It is quite certain that the people prefer to deal with <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> rather than with native officials. On the whole, Government is considerate in remitting or reducing taxation as soon as scarcity is felt. A considerable grievance has been removed or greatly diminished by the reduction of the salt tax, but a minor grievance remains regarding the toddy tax (native palm &#151; tree liquor). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that preferential treatment in favour of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> trade has done much to destroy the older native industries; but this has been amply compensated for by the increased facilities of obtaining articles of comfort and convenience, as also in the employment given to natives in government posts, office work, public works, industries, outlets for produce, etc. No one will deny that detailed improvements in administration are possible and desirable; but the grievances which exist, while affording matter for constitutional representation, are not sufficient to justify any real disaffection, still less resort to violent measures.

<p>The really serious evils of India as felt by the masses are three in number. The first is the artificial creation of famines. The constant recurrence of famine in India is not due to local scarcity of food; for it is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> that there is always in the country at large plenty of grain for the people and abundance to spare &#151; a fact <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the undiminished exportation which goes on all the time. The cause of famine is due simply to the combination of the native grain &#151; dealers, who buy up the supplies and establish famine &#151; prices as soon as the first sign of scarcity is observed. All other explanations of famine in India are either <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, or inadequate and negligible. Government expedients of famine relief &#151; works and free distribution of food are neither adequate nor radical. The proper and effectual remedy would be for Government to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> keeping the prices down and forcing the merchants to sell at those prices. This, however, Government will not do, on the plea of not interfering with freedom of trade &#151; thus losing sight of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the State to protect particular classes of the population from what is equivalently gross oppression. The second <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the extraordinary <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> practised by the native Marwaris or money lenders, who have the people at their mercy in times of stress, and who carry on their business in such a way that getting into their hands usually means total ruin. The necessity of borrowing small sums of money being recognized, the only remedy would be for Government either to provide some means of meeting this need on moderate terms, or else to legislate in some effectual manner for the restraint of the professional money lenders &#151; a matter easy to theorize about but difficult to achieve. The third <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in India is petty tyranny, extortion, and corruption on the part of subordinate native officials. Such a charge can only be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in detailed cases, but its widespread existence seems to be universally admitted and complained of. And as such acts are done under cover of authority, the blame of them is popularly attributed to the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government, which in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is utterly incapable of coping with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. With the removal or diminution of these three evils, and a few adjustments of taxation in view of local circumstances, India would be a most prosperous and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> country as far as good government can make it one.

<p>These remarks, based on six years' careful observation in the country itself, ought to put writers outside India on their guard against the monstrous misrepresentations which are so frequently circulated in the press.
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>In India, there are five <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, namely, those of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/01316b.htm">Allahabad</a>, and the Punjab. They are all organized on the examining-body system, having affiliated to them a large number of teaching colleges, some of which are worked by Government, some by missionary bodies, etc. Below these come numerous high-schools, middle <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, primary- <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of various kinds, to a total of over 160,000. Of those institutions 27,220 are public, 73,192 aided, and 60,057 private and unaided. According to the census of 1901 the statistics of literacy run as follows:<blockquote><p>Males Able to Read and Write &#151; 14,690,080 <br>Males Unable to Read and Write &#151; 134,752,026 <br>Females Able to Read and Write &#151; 996,341 <br>Females Unable to Read and Write &#151; 142,976,459 <br>Total &#151; 293,414,906 </p></blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that immense progress has taken place since then; but even now it is estimated that only 25.3 per cent of the boys and 3.4 per cent of the girls of school-going age attend <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.
<h2>Religious history</h2>

<p>Mention has already been made of the Aryan tribes which immigrated into India many centuries before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It was during their sojourn in the Punjab that the first sacred <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> were composed (the Rig Veda). While pushing eastwards and southwards, the first beginnings of the caste system were formed and the rest of the sacred books written (see Vedas). Their religion, which had in the first instance been a simple kind of nature and hero-worship, was developed by the Brahmin <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and sages into a highly ceremonial cult with a theoretical background of emanative <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> as formulated later on in the Vedanta. While the speculative and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> portions of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> religion were being developed by the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes, the popular religion was being transformed by contact with the older local tribes. The <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> induced by the co-existence of various local <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> received a <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> explanation from the Brahmins, each god being regarded as a particular manifestation of the supreme one. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> came into existence in the sixth century B.C. (Gautama <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> fl. circa 527 B.C.). It adopted many of the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the prevailing <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahministic</a> creed and developed its ascetical consequences, but made no account of the system of caste, and afterwards degenerated into saint and hero worship. During the following centuries <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> gradually spread throughout the country, and constituted a formidable rival to <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a>. A reaction, however, supervened, during which <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> gradually disappeared from the land, though it continued to prevail in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a> and Ceylon. From the thirteenth century A.D., <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a> has retained a permanent hold over at least three-quarters of the population. Out of a miscellaneous collection of elements &#151; <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, Puranic mythology, aboriginal <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">animism</a>, <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04767a.htm">demon worship</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>, there developed a promiscuous system of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice which became hereditary, and which may be called "exoteric or popular <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>" as distinguished from the esoteric or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> religion of the select few. The study of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> therefore naturally falls into two corresponding parts of which a totally separate treatment is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">BRAHMINISM</a>). Besides <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> in these two senses of the term, there exist certain other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, the chief of which may be enumerated as follows: --

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> and a promiscuous collection of archaic low cults and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, still maintained by the more remote aboriginal tribes &#151; a survival of the time prior to the Aryan immigration; and also rife to a great extent among the masses of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>. (2) <a href="../cathen/08269b.htm">Jainism</a>, a form of religion allied equally with <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> and found chiefly in Gujerat and Kathiawar. Its alleged founder Mahavira is said to have died just when <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> was entering into his missionary labours (circa 527 B.C.). (See <a href="../cathen/08269b.htm">JAINISM</a>.) (3) <a href="../cathen/13789a.htm">Sikhism</a>, an off-shoot (originating in the Punjab in the fifteenth century A.D.) claiming to be a purification of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>, in which, however, the worship of a sacred book has largely taken the place of the worship of images (see <a href="../cathen/13789a.htm">SIKHISM</a>). (4) <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>, brought into India by a body of Parsees who fled before the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquerors of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and reached India about A.D. 700. This religion has neither influenced nor been largely influenced by <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>, and is still kept up among the Parsee community exclusively (see <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>; Parsees). (5) <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, introduced into India by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> conquerors, who, beginning about A.D. 1000, gradually spread their domination over the land till in the seventeenth century it reached almost to Cape Comorin. Large numbers were brought over from <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> to this creed. But they retained much of their old caste and ceremonial <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and thus brought into existence a modified form of popular <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, outwardly resembling <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> in many points &#151; among which hero-worship directed to <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> corresponds largely to the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> worship of images (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">MOHAMMED AND MOHAMMEDANISM</a>). (6) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, said to have existed among the White Huns, through whom it may have contributed to the Krishna legend; prevalent from very early times on the Malabar coast and to some extent in several other parts (see <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">THOMAS CHRISTIANS</a>); extensively spread by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> from the year 1500, and afterwards by missionaries of other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations. In recent times <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> have exercised much indirect influence on the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, resulting partly in efforts to purify popular <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> of its grosser elements, partly in adopting a more rationalized interpretation of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and practices. But the popular religion among the masses remains untouched.
<h2>Present religious statistics</h2>

<p>According to the census of 1901 the <a href="../cathen/14275a.htm">religious statistics</a> of the Indian Empire stand as follows: &#151; The votaries of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> number 207,147,026, or about three-quarters of the total. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> come next with 62,458,077. The <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> number 9,476,759, almost exclusively in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a> and Assam. <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> prevails among the aboriginal tribes to the number of 8,584,148. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> come next with a total of 2,923,241. The <a href="../cathen/13789a.htm">Sikhs</a> (chiefly in the Punjab) number 2,195,339; the <a href="../cathen/08269b.htm">Jains</a> (chiefly on the western coasts), 1,334,148; the Parsees (chiefly in Bombay), 94,190; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 18,228 &#151; the rest being insignificant or unclassified.

<h2>Ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in India can be divided into the following sections: (1) From the earliest times down to the advent of the Portuguese, and especially the traditions regarding St. Thomas and the community believed to have been founded by him (see <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">THOMAS CHRISTIANS</a>). (2) Portuguese missionary enterprise <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the year 1498, a brief outline of which appears under <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. (3) The dispute regarding concessions to <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> usage, commencing with Robert de Nobili in 1606 and ending with the final decisions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1742 (see Malabar Rites; Madura Mission). (4) <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> missionary enterprise, commencing about the year 1637. (5) The conflict of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> between the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of propaganda and the Portuguese <em>padroado</em>, commencing in the eighteenth century, reaching its climax in 1838, and its final settlement in 1886 (see <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, Archdiocese of; Padroado). (6) The establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1886 and subsequent organization down to the present time. Besides the special articles referred to, local details will be found under the different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Here it will be sufficient to take a brief survey of the whole. From very early times there existed on the Malabar and Coromandel Coast a considerable community of native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> claiming to have received the Faith from the Apostle St. Thomas, whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is held to have taken place near Mylapur, three miles south of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>. His reputed <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> seems to have been in the hands of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and the community generally appears for several centuries to have been ruled by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> or <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> who were also <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> came into India, they set themselves to the task of removing this <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> taint and bringing the community into union with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and this was accomplished by the Synod of Diamper in 1599. In 1653, in consequence of domestic quarrels, a revolt took place, followed by a conciliation of the great majority, while a certain minority fell away, and became later on a prey to Jacobite influences. The Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; as they are called on account of their liturgy &#151; still flourish and are governed by three <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> at <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a>, Trichur, and Changanacherry respectively.

<p><a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> missionary enterprise, which began shortly after 1500, partly followed the progress of conquest, but also extended beyond it, so that large communities were formed in the south of the peninsula and as far as Madras on the east coast, and Dam&atilde;o on the west, while sporadic efforts were made from time to time further northwards, as far as Bengal, <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, and even Tibet. The chief successes were, first, within the strictly Portuguese territory of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, where the fullest influence of the State lay at the back of the missionaries; secondly, on the Fishery Coast about Cape Comorin; thirdly, in the inland districts of Madura; fourthly, in the districts of <a href="../cathen/02343a.htm">Bassein</a>, Salsette, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, Karanja, and Chaul on the western coast, north of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were the first orders in the field, soon to be followed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and Augustinians, and later on by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. John, and <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. The tide of enterprise reached its highest soon after A.D. 1600, by which time vast numbers had been enrolled in the membership of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The work of attending to the wants of such large communities naturally placed a limit on further missionary expansion. Moreover, as the power of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> itself began to decline, there was a falling off in the supply of missionaries, and after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773 it may be said that missionary progress under Portuguese patronage came practically to a standstill. Meantime the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, recognizing the inadequacy of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> resources to deal with so vast a country, began to provide independently for the spread of the Gospel by appointing <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, under <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, the first being that of the Deccan, afterwards called the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Great Mogul, and finally the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. This appointment, made about 1637, was followed by others down to recent times, till the whole of the country outside the actual sphere of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> ministrations was in some way provided for. It soon happened that where the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> came into contact with the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there arose a conflict of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> resting their claims on the direct delegation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> party took their stand on the ancient prerogatives of the patronage as well as the prescriptive right of possession. The policy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> throughout this conflict was to support unequivocally the position of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, at the same time recommending them to use caution and thereby avoid dissension where possible. The strained relations between the two parties reached a climax when in 1838 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> cancelled the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the three suffragan Sees of Crangaqnore, <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, and Mylapur and transferred it to the nearest <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, and did the same with regard to certain portions of territory which had formerly been under the authority of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> itself. The struggle, which was most fierce in the districts of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, and Madura, continued till 1857, when a concordat was drawn up which gave comparative peace to the churches, but left the two conflicting jurisdictions almost in <em>statu quo</em>. Finally in 1886 another concordat was established, and at the same time the whole country was divided into ecclesiastical provinces, and certain portions of territory, withdrawn in 1838, were restored to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The delineations made in 1886 were afterwards supplemented by adjustments and subdivisions down to 1899, since when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> distribution has been stable. The following lists will summarize the main facts thus described: (1) The old foundations of the Portuguese Padroado: &#151; <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, 1534; Chochin, 1557; Cranganore, 1600; San Thom&eacute; (Mylapur), 1606. (2) Vicariates founded before 1800: &#151; Great Mogul, 1637; Malabar, 1659; Bombay and Tibet, 1720: Ava and Pegu (Burma), 1722. (3) Vicariates founded from 1800 to 1886: &#151; Tibet, 1826; Bengal, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, and Ceylon, 1834; Madura and Coromandel, 1836; Agra and Patna, 1845; Jaffna, 1847; East and West Bengal, <a href="../cathen/15496a.htm">Vizagapatam</a>, <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, <a href="../cathen/04095a.htm">Coimbatore</a> and Mysore, 1850; Hyderabad (Deccan), 1851; Mangalore, <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, and Verapoly, 1853; Poona, 1854; Central Bengal, North and South Burma, 1870; Punjab and Kashmir, 1880; Kandy, 1883; East Burma, 1886. (4) The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> as established in 1886 consisted of eight <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> bearing the titles of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a>, and Ceylon, each having his subject <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, vicariates and prefectures Apostolic. (5) The following new subdivisions were made after 1886: &#151; Kashmir, <a href="../cathen/10669a.htm">Nagpur</a>, Trichur, and Kottayam, 1887; Assam, 1889; <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a>, and Changanacherry, 1890; Rajputana, 1891; Bettiah, 1892; Galle and Trincomalee, 1893; Kumbakonam, 1899. To these must be added the three <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> of Burma.
<h2>Catholic statistics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization connected with India does not by any means coincide with the political divisions of the country. India consists of eight ecclesiastical provinces, seven of which are in the peninsula and the eighth in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. The Provinces of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, Verapoly are entirely in the Indian Empire. The Province of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> comprises Portuguese India and some portion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> India, besides the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the Far East. The Province of <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a> comprises French India and some portion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> India, as well as the <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Diocese of Malacca</a> in the Straits Settlements. The Province of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> is entirely in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a> and so outside the Indian Empire. On the other hand, the three vicariates of <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, which at present belong to the Indian Empire, are not part of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> India proper, and lie outside the Apostolic Delegation of the East Indies. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Aden, which belongs politically to the Bombay Presidency. Our best course, therefore, in giving ecclesiastical statistics, will be to take the general group just described, indicating certain subtractions which must be made in order to bring the figures into relation with the Government census of India.

<p>(1) Province of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. &#151; In the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Archdiocese of Goa</a> 299,628 belong to Portuguese territory and 35,403 to British territory. In the Diocese of Dam&atilde;o 2,213 belong to Portuguese territory and 69,789 to British territory. Out of these latter, 26,419 are Goanese living in Bombay island, under the personal and not territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/04610a.htm">Dam&atilde;o</a>. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and Mylapur are entirely in British territory. The more remote suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the Far East are omitted from the list. (2) Province of <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. &#151; In the <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Archdiocese of Pondicherry</a> 25,859 belong to French territory and 117,266 to British territory. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are all in British India except Malacca, which is altogether outside India. (3) Province of <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a>. &#151; The three Vicariates of <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a>, Changanacherry, and Trichur consist of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Syrian Rite, with a total 325,281 (<a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a>). By subtracting the figures for French India, Portuguese India, <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>, and Ceylon, and separating off the Syrian vicariates, the total results for the Indian Empire (including Burma) for the year 1908 are as follows: &#151; Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 1,439,066; Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 325,281. A comparison with the census of 1901 reveals an increase of 190,325 Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 2,695 Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; which is probably a fair estimate of progress during the last eight years. As far as older statistics can be obtained for purposes of comparison, the total number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in British India (not including Burma or Ceylon) in 1857 was 801,858. In 1885 they had risen to 1,030,100 and in 1905 to 1,582,186.
<h2>Double jurisdiction</h2>

<p>One of the peculiarities of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> India, though not unknown in other parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is the existence in certain places of what is popularly known as a "double <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>". The historical explanation lies in the fact that when the jurisdictional conflict was brought to a close in 1886, the Padroado sphere of influence was not restricted to Portuguese territory, but allowed to remain in many parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> India where the Padroado <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were in actual possession. In the first place the See of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> was allowed to retain a considerable part of the coast country north and south of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>; while the two ancient Sees of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and Mylapur and the newly erected See of <a href="../cathen/04610a.htm">Dam&atilde;o</a> were all three totally in British territory. But it happened that in the case of Mylapur there existed certain widely scattered and isolated <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which were actually under Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> administration, and these were retained as exempted churches in the midst of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> territory. Thus to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mylapur belong no fewer than fifteen separate churches scattered over the <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Diocese of Trichinopoly</a>, with others in <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, and Dacca giving a total number of twenty-eight. In the Island of Salsette, near <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, which was made over to the Diocese of Dam&atilde;o, six churches remained attached to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. In some of these places both jurisdictions exist side by side, the one holding territorial sway, the other possessing exemption. In Bombay a more special arrangement was made &#151; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> under <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> enjoying territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04610a.htm">Dam&atilde;o</a> holds personal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over those who are Goanese by birth or otherwise connected with Padroado rule; and a certain complicated code exists for determining the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to which <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> belong (see under <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>; Bombay; Dam&atilde;o; St. Thomas of Mylapur). In the <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Archdiocese of Verapoly</a> (Malabar Coast) another form of double <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> exists, this time based on a difference of rite. There the Latins are under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/14413a.htm">Syrian Christians</a> (Syrians not by race but by liturgy only) in the same territorial limits are assigned to three <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of the same rite.
<h2>The Catholic clergy</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> regime, the first missionary work was done by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> a large body of native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> came into existence, some of whom strongly developed the apostolic spirit; but in general their work was to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and mission-stations which had already been founded by the missionary orders. On the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> territory in 1834, the whole care of the faithful devolved on the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, who at present work in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, Mylapur, and Dam&atilde;o &#151; a few being <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Portuguese, and the rest natives of India. Of recent years a few <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have been introduced in the parts which lie outside Portuguese territory.

<p>Similarly the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> were initiated and continued to be worked by <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries of different orders and nationalities, assisted by such secular native or other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as they were able to train up. When the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was established in 1886 the same regime was retained, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being generally of the same order or congregation. The foregoing list shows the orders and nationalities in the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The fewness of missionaries of British extraction in India is sometimes made a matter of criticism by Englishmen not conversant with history. They forget that at the time when India was assigned to <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was not in a condition to send out foreign missionaries. Secondly, it is much less than a century ago since <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> began to acquire anything like a general footing in the country. Even at the present time the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> have their hands full in attending to the needs of their own country, and have few men to spare for outside enterprise. Then again, as regards the far greater part of India, the nationality of the missionaries is a matter of indifference, since the work is almost entirely with native communities, who have to be dealt with in the vernacular. In the larger towns, where English is a current language, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> manage to equip themselves with a sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of English, and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, though in individual cases a deficiency may sometimes be found. Those who travel will never come across a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionary in British territory who cannot make himself understood in English, and in the majority of cases the proficiency attained is remarkable.

<p>The actual statistics of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> group already described may be estimated approximately at 2,800 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom about 1,050 are <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, and about 1,750 of native extraction. By a cross division about 2,000 may be classed as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> (including the Mill Hill Fathers and the Foreign Mission Fathers), and about 800 as members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or congregations. There are also more than 500 brothers of various orders and congregations, and about 3,000 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; and the number of <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> served rises above 5,000.
<h2>Catholic missionary work</h2>

<p>The figures of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population given above include only those who are ascertainably members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; all converts being subjected to careful tests and instruction before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The numbers are mostly made up of native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, partly of the higher but chiefly of the lower castes, together with a certain percentage of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> belonging to the army, government and civil service, railways, etc., and a number of Eurasians. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is densest among the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a> of Travancore, where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions are of the smallest. The coast districts east and west (the scene of the ancient Portuguese and French missions), and especially the south of the peninsula, come next in order of numbers: and here the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are larger. The farther north we go the more scanty the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population becomes. Thus the Province of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, which in dimensions covers almost as much space as the other seven provinces taken together, contains the smallest number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; this being a field which has only begun to be worked in recent times. At present the largest mission centres for natives are in Chota Nagpur, (<a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Diocese of Calcutta</a>) the Godaveri districts (Hyderabad), the Telugu districts (Madras), the districts of <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Trichinopoly</a>, Madura, <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, <a href="../cathen/08710a.htm">Kumbakonam</a>, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a>, etc., in the south. Smaller but growing missions are in the Ahmednagar District (Poona) and the Anand District (Bombay). It has been estimated that the number of converts <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the year 1903 amounted to about 16,000; while the number of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> preparing for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> counted about 45,000. At the present time the rate of progress, though not definitely ascertainable in detail, has certainly advanced.
<h2>Missionary success</h2>

<p>One of the moot questions in connection with India is the real or supposed difference between missionary progress in the past and in the present. The prevailing surface impression is that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body of India was build up suddenly within the space of say a century and a half by the Portuguese missionaries, the fruits of whose enterprise we inherit and to some extent keep up without adding much thereto in modern times. Special investigation would be required in order to give a documented answer; but the following considerations will help towards a sound view of the case. In the first case, the reason usually regarded by non-Catholics as an adequate explanation of past success, viz., that the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> spread the Gospel by force; or, as it is sometimes said, "at the point of the sword", is certainly an exaggerated one, and in many respects <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. There are on record a few isolated cases in which, equivalently at least, physical force was used &#151; for instance, where a ship-load of captured pirates were given the option of embracing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> or being thrown into the sea. But such acts were entirely unsupported by authority, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or civil, besides being so rare as not to count. As to the policy of the state, the local tendency was rather to be tolerant of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and to let religious propagandism go; and when, under pressure from the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, an organized policy of support for the Faith was framed, physical coercion was not one of its elements. It may safely be said that there existed in the legislature no law forcing a born <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; nor was compulsion exercised in practice. The methods adopted by the State consisted, first, in a ruthless destruction of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, and fouling of sacred tanks in districts where the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> was fully dominant and the Gospel had been preached; and also in forbidding the public exercise of any alien religion within the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> confines. Political and social advantages of various kinds were attached to conversion, and corresponding disabilities to non-conversion; and in certain parts, all adults over the age of fifteen were compelled to listen to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> instructions on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> under pain of fine and, if obdurate, of expulsion from the district. This policy had partly the effect of bringing converts, often of dubious quality, into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and partly of driving away from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> confines those who were tenacious of their ancestral creed. But it is to be noted that these measures were by no means carried into effect uniformly at all times and in all places, and their sphere was in any case confined to the narrow limits of actual Portuguese territory, or even to a small radius round the chief centres such as <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and <a href="../cathen/02343a.htm">Bassein</a>. More defensible and even praiseworthy methods were also in vogue, such as making great account of public <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of converts, in which the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> nobility stood sponsors to the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> and bestowed on them their illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> names &#151; hence the prevalence of De Souzas, De Mellos, Almeidas, Pereiras, and even Albuquerques, etc. among the people to this day. Another usage was to rescue slaves from the slave-dealers, either by capture or purchase, and turn them into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; or again, to take charge of all <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and bring them up in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In some cases outside Portuguese territory, conversion was promoted by affording protection to the helpless classes against the tyranny of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, as occurred on the Fishery Coast. Hence it seems clear that practices savouring of coercion were in some cases a partial, but never the sole or adequate, cause of conversions. This is shown by the fact that missionary work proceeded with equal or even greater success in districts altogether remote from state influence, e.g. Madura, where the missionaries worked on lines of persuasion alone, unaided by even the mere prestige of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> at their back.

<p>If then, as must be admitted, the progress of missionary success in modern times is not so notable as in the past, a complexity of causes must be assigned, of which the following are the chief: &#151; The early missionaries had the advantage of being pioneers working in an open field. They were at first unhampered by the existence of large communities of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> needing constant <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> care. They had, moreover, the stimulus of novelty, and their message had also the advantage of novelty. It came to the people as a surprise, and large bodies of converts could be brought in before the enemies of the Faith had time to formulate objections to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and to imbue the minds of the people with them. Besides this there were no <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions in those days (the first beginning of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> enterprise was at Tranquebar in 1704), so that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was able to present an undivided front to the country, as there were no rival <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and creeds to be played off one against another. Then again, the terms on which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were admitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> were much more lenient than nowadays. A willing disposition, accompanied by a brief instruction, was in many cases taken as sufficient grounds for admitting thousands together to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; whereas at present a careful course of instruction and probation lasting at least a whole year is the usual requirement &#151; less reliance being placed on subsequent instruction and training than was formerly the case. The result is probably a better quality of convert nowadays than in many instances was then secured. If it is allowed that the prestige of the Portuguese State went then for a great deal in favour of conversion, it must be added that at present the professed neutrality of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government is nothing short of a public encouragement of indifferentism. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Western civilization are also undoubtedly an important obstacle to the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in modern times, for they materialize the people's minds and interests, induce <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a> or indifferentism, sophisticate the simple, and encourage the worldly &#151; disintegrating the old creeds, but building up nothing in their place. Of obstacles inherent to the people themnselves, rigid conservatism of mind and the trammels of the caste system are certainly of the first magnitude. Hence it is found today, as it was found in Portuguese times, that in places where the pressure of the State was unfelt, the Brahmins were the most difficult to convert, and the low-caste and no-caste people the easiest. In modern times the greatest missionary success is invariably found (1) among the aborigines or depressed classes; (2) among those who are without caste and outside the influence of the Brahmins; (3) in districts most remote from railways and centres of civilization; and (4) in places where one missionary body alone holds the field. Among the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes, especially those who have been trained in the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> manner, conversions are extremely rare &#151; sometimes on account of indifferentism and unbelief imported from the west; sometimes for want of practical seriousness of purpose in religious discussion, of which many are extremely fond; and sometimes on account of a certain slackness of mind and a tendency to vague viewiness, or symbolism and poetic fancy instead of a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of facing and gripping facts &#151; a peculiarity temperamental to the eastern mind.
<h2>Catholic education</h2>

<p>Besides strictly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministrations to the faithful and efforts for the spread of the Faith, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of India take a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work of the country. The latest complete collection of statistics in this branch was compiled in 1904. It includes the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> group already mentioned with the exception of <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a> (according to Krose some of the figures for Burma can be supplied as follows: &#151; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 151, with 8,983 pupils; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 958). The following particulars are taken from this list:
<h3>Male education</h3>

<p>23 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a> with 697 native students; 8 scholasticates of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders with 101 scholastics; 15 novitiates with 79 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; 12 <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> colleges (most of them small ones) with 1,343 students; 67 high schools for boys with 9,771 students; 251 middle <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 23,889 pupils; 2,465 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 98,687 pupils; 4 normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 77 pupils; 26 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 977 pupils; 17 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for catechists with 277 students; 114 male <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 5,141 inmates; 76 boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 6,037 inmates.
<h3>Female education</h3>

<p>67 novitiates for conventual orders with 450 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; 61 high schools with 3,202 pupils; 248 middle <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 15,229 pupils; 683 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 41,263 pupils; 11 normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 186 pupils; 59 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 2,335 pupils; 138 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 7,489 inmates; 108 boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 5,220 inmates. The total number of children under <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is 204,481 (137,326 boys and 67,155 girls). This figure includes 12,650 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> of both sexes.

<p>It is to be noted that the numbers of pupils in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> includes a large proportion of non-Catholics. The policy of opening our <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to outsiders is due to the fact that in many places the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are either too few or too poor to maintain efficient <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges for themselves alone, and the admission of others is in most cases the only means by which a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> auspices can be secured. Under such arrangements religious instruction is given apart to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pupils; but the slightest show of propagandism has to be avoided with regard to the others. The part played by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the general <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work of the country, as well as the results, second to none, which are obtained, brings great prestige to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. It also establishes excellent relations with large numbers of better-class <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, Parsees, etc., who openly express their <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> to the "Fathers" who have <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> them, and are commonly ready to befriend them. It is mainly to this prominence in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> owe the high esteem which they enjoy in the country.
<h3>Catholic literary enterprise</h3>

<p>On the whole the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of India do not make much use of the press as a means of exercising influence on those outside the Fold. Their publications consist mainly of the Scriptures, Bible histories, catechisms, <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayerbooks</a>, and works of instruction, some in English, but most in the vernacular, executed at mission presses in <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Trichinopoly</a>, <a href="../cathen/09588b.htm">Mangalore</a>, <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, Bettiah, etc. Of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly newspapers there are several such as "The Catholic Herald of India" (Calcutta); "The Examiner" (Bombay); "The Catholic Watchman" (Madras); "The Catholic Register" (San Thom&eacute;) &#151; all in English; "O Crente", official organ of the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Archdiocese of Goa</a>; "O Anglo-Luisitano", representing the Goan community in Bombay; beside several others in English and sundry local idioms. On the whole the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press confines its attention to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests without entering into the social or political affairs of the country. For the use of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a "Promptuarium Canonico-Liturgicum" is published at <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a>. Mention should also be made of the "Madras Catholic Directory", giving the status of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for the whole of India, and published annually since the year 1851.
<h2>Protestant missionary work</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries to set foot in India were two <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, who began work in 1705 in the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> settlement of Tranquebar. Their first step was to translate the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into Tamil, and afterwards into Hindustani. They made little progress at first, but gradually spread to <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, Cuddalore, and Tanjore. In 1750 Schwartz carried on the work thus begun and extended it to Tinnevelly near Cape Comorin. After the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> came the <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, who began work at Serampur near Calcutta. In 1758 a <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> missionary first devoted attention to Calcutta. In 1799 there was a great outburst of energy at Serampur, whose missionaries are said in the space of ten years to have translated the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into thirty-one languages or dialects, and by 1816 had formed a community of 700 converts. The <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Missionary Society entered the field in 1798. By the "New Charter" of 1813 the East India Company provided for the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, with three archdeaconries, one for each presidency. This led the way to further enterprise on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society, which started in 1814, and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which followed in 1826. Their greatest successes were scored in Southern India, in the fields already opened by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. In 1835 the See of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> was established, and in 1837 that of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. In 1877 two missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assistant to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> were appointed for the Tinnevelly missions, and new sees were erected at <a href="../cathen/08742c.htm">Lahore</a> and Rangoon, in <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>. The missionary Bishopric of Travancore and Cochin was established in 1879. The first missionary sent by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> arrived in 1830. Since then the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the Wesleyan <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, the Salvation Army, and various other bodies, <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and American, have been added to the list. Summing up the figures of progress, we find that in 1830 there were only nine <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> at work, with about 27,000 native <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in India, <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, and Ceylon. In 1870 there were no fewer than thirty-five such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, with an estimate of 318,363 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Christians</a>. In 1852 there were 459 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries and in 1872 there were 606. Features of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> methods of work are: the spread of the Scriptures in the local vernacular; <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children, specially in vernacular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; special efforts in the way of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; and a very extensive use of native missionaries, not only <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, but also lay preachers both male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> (Hunter's "Indian Empire").

<p>Great stress is sometimes laid on the rapid growth of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> numbers, and the relatively smaller increase of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> numbers. Thus Mr. J.N. Farquhar, writing in the "Contemporary Review" for May, 1908, offers the following comparisons (<a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> including Latins and Syrians, and comprising British and French but not Portuguese India; while <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> include all native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in India excluding Burma):<blockquote><p>1851: 732,887 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 91,092 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> <br>1871: 934,400 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 224,258 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> <br>1891: 1,313,653 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 559,661 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> <br>1901: 1,550,614 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 871,991 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>From these and other figures he calculates that, whereas the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> increase for fifty years is only 111.5 per cent, that of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> during the same period is 857.2 per cent. The question is a complicated one, because we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the methods by which the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> figures are obtained, i.e., whether they include only really initiated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; what proportion of the conversions are permanent, or how far pecuniary assistance has to do with many of them. Putting this aside, it is to be noted that whereas most of our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> energy is taken up by permanent ministrations to numerous stable bodies of hereditary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionary enterprise is to a great extent of recent origin, and has had before it an open field. The different missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> on their first arrival find themselves free from pre-existing ties, and can give their whole energy to breaking new ground in remote districts, where there is always the best chance of securing rapid results. Only after the pioneer work is finished, and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> converts are settled down as hereditary <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, will the comparison of percentages provide a fair test. Moreover if percentages are left aside, and attention paid to the actual growth of numbers, it will be found from the above figures that whereas <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have increased by 817,727, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> during the same period have only increased by 780,899. This fact puts quite a different aspect on the case.
<h2>Architecture and arch&aelig;logy</h2>

<p>India is rich in arch&aelig;ological monuments of various kinds, and presents a remarkable variety of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> works of highest excellence, embodying the history of the past. First come the stupas or topes connected with early <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, and dating centuries before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The chief of these are found at Sarnath near Benares, Baya, Sanchi, and other parts of Northern India, the scene of the original <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> movement, and at Anuradhapura, etc., in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. The country is also dotted over with <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> rock-cut <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from a century before Christ to about the seventh century A.D., the most important being those at Ellora and Ajunta, Nasick, Badami, Kennery in Salsette, and Karli near <a href="../cathen/12235b.htm">Poona</a>, etc.; besides these there are numerous <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminical</a> rock-temples <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from about the seventh century, apparently in imitation of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> precedent. Of these the best known is that of Elephanta near Bombay. From the seventh century A.D. there was a great development of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> temple-building, chiefly in the South of India &#151; of which noble specimens are Lakundi, Aivally, Paddatgul, Badami, etc., near Gadag, and also in the parts round about Madras. <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> architecture reached its climax in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as at Vijayanagar, Madura, Tajnore, <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Trichinopoly</a>, and other places near the Coromandel Coast. Nor should Benares or the Orissa Coast be omitted. In the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/08269b.htm">Jains</a> of Rajputana had attained wonderful perfection in the marble carvings of the interiors of their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, of which the finest specimens are seen on Mount Abu and at Girnar. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> art also grew to the highest perfection in <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, Delhi, and other northern centres, and also in the Deccan sultanates at Gulberga, Golconda, and Bijapur. At Ahmedabad a special kind of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> architecture was developed through the employment of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> workmen under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> direction, while in Sind the mausoleums are remarkable for the splendour of their interior decoration with encaustic tile-work. Among secular buildings the palaces of rajahs and sultans, and the hill forts of various chiefs, are objects of interest. Add to this the eminence attained by Indian artisans of the past in all kinds of jewellery work, brass work, enamel work, wood carving, weaving, and <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, and it will be seen that there is probably no country which might more profitably be visited by the art student than India.
<h2>Catholic arch&aelig;logy</h2>

<p>Except for the reputed <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Thomas near Mylapur, the two shrines at the Great and Little Mounts close by, a few early stone monuments, and a few inscriptions on copper in Travancore, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antiquities are wanting before Portuguese times. The Portuguese churches of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, though without pretension to high artistic style, were in many cases majestic and imposing. The finest group was naturally at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, but the ruins at <a href="../cathen/02343a.htm">Bassein</a> and Chaul near Bombay are also of remarkable interest both for number and size. Elsewhere the churches are mostly of secondary importance. The presence of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is marked by numerous stone crosses of a peculiar shape scattered about the country, especially along the seashores and on the tops of hills near Bombay. Among modern buildings of note may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/01316b.htm">Allahabad</a> and Lahore, the college churches of <a href="../cathen/09588b.htm">Mangalore</a> and Trichinopoly, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches of Karachi and the Holy Name, Bombay. The college buildings of <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Trichinopoly</a>, <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, Darjeeling, and Bombay are also worthy of mention.
<h2>Religious policy of government</h2>

<p>With regard to religion, the Indian Government maintains an attitude of strict neutrality. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> is not in any sense "by law established", and whatever official countenance is given to it rests purely on the principle of providing for the religious requirements of subjects belonging to its communion, e.g., by appointments and salaries for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and subsidies for the building or maintenance of military churches. A similar patronage, etc., is extended to the Scotch <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church, and in a less degree to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. No better statement of the details of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be found than that contributed by Mr. J.A. Saldanha to the "Examiner" of 23 February, 1907, and 24 July, 1909, which runs as follows:
<h3>In British India</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental principles of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government in India is the toleration and equal protection of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. Every <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a> enjoys the utmost freedom of action, and the religious privileges and susceptibilities of every community, caste, and class are respected with the most delicate care. This policy drew encomiums as early as 1818 from Abb&eacute; Dubois, a French missionary of Southern India, who in the preface to his treatise on "Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies" attributes the strength of the British power in India among other causes to "the inviolable respect which they constantly show for the customs and religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the country; and the protection they afford to the weak as well as to the strong, to the Brahmin as to the Pariah, to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahomedan</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a>". This attitude of toleration, protection, and equal treatment of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> was affirmed in the most emphatic language in the royal proclamation of 1858": &#151; "We declare it to be Our royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favoured, none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or observances, but all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the Law; and We do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under Us, that they abstain from all interference with the religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> or worship of any of Our subjects, on pain of Our highest displeasure". Assemblies within <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> or outside are never to be interfered with in British India except in cases of disorder. The police authorities have only the right of licensing and regulating public assemblies on public roads under Act V of 1861. On the other had, under the same enactment they are bound to keep order "in the neighbourhood of places of worship, during the time of public worship". The utmost liberty is allowed to preach on religious subjects even in public streets, provided no cause is given to offend the religious feelings of the hearers or others, and no disturbance of public peace or obstruction to traffic is caused. No restriction is imposed on other means of propagating a religion, except such as would bring the measures within any of the offences against religion or the offence of defamation as defined in the penal code.

<p>Even practices regarded by the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes as grossly <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> are tolerated. It is only in places to which the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1890, has been specifically extended that measures can be legally taken to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain on animals in connection with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, etc. But the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and religious but inhuman practices of <em>Satti</em> and <em>Thaggi</em> have been abolished by the strong hand of law.

<p>No native of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> India, nor any natural-born subject of His Majesty the King resident therein, is by reason only of his religion, place of birth, descent, colour, disabled from holding any office under the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government (3 and 4 Will.IV, c. 85). The scrupulous regard to the policy of non-interference with religious practices of the people in British India is carried so far that the courts have always refused to interfere with the internal <em>autonomy of castes.</em> The principle is that where the caste exercises its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> on a subject which interests its members, it is enough if it proceeds according to caste usage and exercises powers with due care and in accordance with custom (see I.L.R. 24 Bom. 30; 26 Bom. 174). Where a community is a <em>private and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a></em> resting upon a consensual basis, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> observed is that the members make rules for themselves and may constitute a tribunal to enforce the rules, and the decision of that tribunal is binding when it has acted within the scope of its authority and in a manner consonant with the general principles of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. When the decision of a domestic tribunal has been arrived at <em><a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">bona fide</a></em>, the court has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to interfere (I.L.R. XI Bom. 174). Act I of 1880 is the only enactment in the British Indian Statute Book relating to religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. It confers on bodies associated for the propose of maintaining religious worship certain powers in respect of (1) appointment of new trustees in cases not otherwise provided for, (2) vesting their properties in these new trustees without a formal instrument, and (3) dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> by three-fifths of their number at a meeting convened for such purpose. Questions regarding the validity of the appointments of any trustee, as to whether any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is a member of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, etc., can be submitted for adjudication to the High Court. This Act confers only certain enabling powers on religious associations, and allows High Courts to interfere only when there are certain disputes within an association.

<p>One of the striking features of the British Administration in India &#151; the result of its respect for the customs of the people &#151; is that by far the great mass of them are allowed to regulate their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of succession, inheritance, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, etc., according to their immemorial usages. The enactments regarding succession, wills, etc., are intended for communities who are supposed not to have any set usages to fall back upon. The State scrupulously avoids interference even with the usages of converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In <em>Abraham v. Abraham</em> (9 M.I.A., 195) the Privy Council held, "The profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> releases the convert from the trammels of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> Law, but it does not of necessity involve any change in the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or relations of the convert in matters with which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has no concern, such as his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and interests in, and powers over, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The convert, though not bound as to such matters, either by the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> Law or by any other positive law, may by his course of conduct after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> have shown by what law he intended to be governed as to these matters." A recent decision of the Bombay High Court has gone so far as to recognize the legal existence of the peculiar system of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> co-parcenership among the native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Kanara (8 Bom. L.R. 770). It is interesting to note how, where the State has thought fit to pass special enactments as to marriages and dissolution of marriages among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or converts, the usages of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholics</a> have been duly respected, as in the Christian Marriage Act of 1872 (Sections 9, 10, 30, 32 65), and the Dissolution of Native Converts' Marriages Act of 1866, Section 34, which provides that "nothing contained in this Act shall be taken to render invalid any marriage of a native convert to <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholicism</a>, if celebrated in accordance with the rules, rites, ceremonies, and customs of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>". Such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or usages as inflict on any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> forfeiture of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and may be held in any way to impair or affect any right of inheritance, by reason of his renouncing or having been excluded from the communion of any religion or being deprived of caste, have been declared illegal by Act XXI of 1851.

<p>The only apparent exception to the policy of equal favour to all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities is the modest endowment of the established religion by the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Protestant Anglican</a> Bishops and civil <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and churches under their control and their establishment. This arose from the fact that the officers of the East India Company, who established British dominion in India, consisted mainly of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Protestants</a>; and while the East India Company took good care to maintain old <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> and the establishments of their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of worship which had been endowed and maintained by previous rulers, it was but natural that it should have provided for an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishment needed for the majority of its officers. The Government of India Act, 1833 (3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 85), while authorizing the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution provides for the appointment of two <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> on the establishment of each presidency. "Provided always that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent the Governor-General in Council from granting from time to time to any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, persuasion, or community of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, not being of the United Church of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, such sums of money as may be expedient for the purpose of instruction or for the maintenance of places of worship".

<p>In the last respect the Government of India cannot be said to be partial to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as compared with non-Christians; since it spends large sums of State money over a number of non-Christian <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> and institutions in continuance and perpetuation of the practice of their predecessors in the government of the country. This is done either directly by periodical payments, or indirectly by means of <em>inams</em> or grant lands free from assessment. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishments had their origin in the ancient chaplaincies attached to the East India Company's factories in India.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> religion comes in for rather an insignificant share of the State's bounty. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> troops are allowed the ministration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but the State does not maintain them on anything like the scale extended to <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> &#151; the expenditure on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and their establishments, etc., for the whole of the Indian Army amounting to Rs. 284,000 per annum. (The rupee varies in value from 30 to 32 cents.) An instructive commentary on this part of the subject is furnished by the figures of expenditure in the Bombay Presidency. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> costs Rs. 289,708 per annum; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> Rs. 34,435; while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receives only Rs. 10,374, or about equal to the salary of one <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> senior <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. (The monthly allowance of Rs. 500 given to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is for statistical returns.) Compare this with the annual cash allowances given to non-Christian <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and mosques, amounting to not less than Rs. 255,000; in addition to the enormous revenues derived from lands presented to them by the State, on which the mere assessment (which of course is not recovered) comes to close on Rs. 900,000. In other words, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government spends on non-Christian <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and mosques over eleven lacs of rupees every year in the Bombay Presidency alone. Whether this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is inherited from its predecessors, and if so to what extent, is more than one can venture to say. In any case it throws out into bold relief the extreme sensitiveness of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government to the religious susceptibilities of its non-Christian subjects.

<p>In regard to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government in India generously patronizes and aids with grants <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges established by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or associations, whether religious or secular. It is important to note that the Government <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authorities never think of interfering with the arrangements made in these aided <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for imparting religious instruction. What the Universities Act (VIII of 1904) and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> codes require is that the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges should be efficiently maintained for imparting secular instruction up to the standard required. The question of the religious instruction of the pupils, even in institutions maintained by purely religious bodies, is one with which Government does not concern itself. Teachers of religion are not paid by Government as such, but they are allowed perfect freedom in selecting the subjects of religious instruction, the time of the day chosen, and the method of treatment. One cannot help wondering why this policy of the Government in India, viz., of non-interference with religious teaching in <em>aided</em> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, cannot be adopted in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as a solution of its <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> difficulty.

<p>The British Indian law not only recognizes not only corporate bodies with <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> vested in the corporation apart from its individual members, but also the juridical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or subjects called foundations. A <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> or a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> can establish a religious or charitable institution by simply expressing his purpose and endowing it; and the State will give effect to the bounty or at least protect it. A formal trust is not required for this purpose (I.L.R., 12 Bombay, 247; 7 Allahabad, 178). Under the native system of government it was looked upon as a heinous offense to appropriate to secular purposes the estate that had once been dedicated to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> uses (W. and B.; H.L. 202, 817). The State, however, in its secular executive and judicial capacity habitually intervened to prevent <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and waste in dealing with religious endowments. It was quite in accordance with the legal consciousness of the people that the Bombay Regulation XVII of 1827 gave to the collector a visitatorial power enabling him to enforce an honest and proper administration of religious endowments. The connection of the Government in its executive capacity with <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> foundations was brought to an end for Bombay by Bombay Act VII of 1863, and for Bengal and Madras by ACT XX of 1863. But the existence of sacred <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> connected with it as objects of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the civil courts is recognized by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> just referred to. The law which protects the foundation against external <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> guards it also internally against maladministration, and regulates, <em>conformably to the central principle of the institution</em>, the use of its augmented funds. It is only as subject to this control in the general interest of the community that the State through the lawcourts recognizes merely artificial <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. It guards <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as devoted, and thus belonging, so to speak, to a particular allowed purpose, only on a condition of varying the application when either the purpose has become impracticable, useless, or pernicious, or the funds have augmented in an extraordinary measure. This principle is recognized in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as it was in the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, whence indeed it was derived by the modern codes of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and is applied to religious institutions in India. The courts can draw up schemes for the management of a religious endowment and its funds, when internal disputes arise among its administrators or those interested in it, giving, however, due consideration to the established practice of the institution and position of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of worship and of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> connected with it (see Justice West's remarks in I.L.R., 12 Bom. 247). Religious endowments have been held not to be vested in the public at large, but in that part of the public for whose religious benefit they were originally established (I.L.R., 7 All. 178).

<p>The Courts in India have always refused to recognize the authority of the parishioners or the congregations of a church founded by the people themselves or their ancestors, and devoted to religious worship according to the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> ritual, to manage or divert its temporalities independently of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>, much less to interfere in its public worship or change the character thereof. Whatever be the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of what are called "juntas" in certain <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the congregations are not deemed to have any legal existence independent of the vicar under the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deriving his authority from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (see the decision of the Madras High Court of Feb., 1895, and the sub-judge's decision conformed to it, printed in the "History of the Diocese of Mangalore", pp. 213-218).
<h3>In Native States</h3>

<p>In the Interpretation Act, 1889 (52 and 53 Vict. ch 63), the expression "India" is defined as meaning British India <em>together with</em> any territories of any native prince or chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty, exercised through the Governor General of India or through any governor or other officer subordinate to the Governor General of India. The territory of the Native States is not British territory; nor are their subjects British subjects. But the sovereignty over them, as Sir Courtenany Ilbert in his "Government in India" aptly observes, "is divided between the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government and their rulers in proportions which differ greatly according to the history and importance of the several States, and which are regulated partly by treaties or less formal engagements, partly by <em>sanads</em> or charters, and partly by usage". The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government has undertaken to protect these states from external aggression. But Government "as the paramount power (a) exercises exclusive control over the foreign relations of the State; (b) assumes a general but a limited responsibility for the internal peace of the State; (c) assumes a special responsibility for the safety and welfare of the <em>British</em> subjects resident in the State". The last is enjoyed by <em>delegation</em> from Indian principalities expressed by treaty or based on tacit and long usage. Such delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is exercised also on British railways running through protected states, in civil stations, cantonments, and residences within them. In these areas a large number of British-Indian enactments have been introduced by the Governor General of India under the operation of ACT XXI of 1879, the preamble of which runs as follows: &#151; "Whereas by treaty, capitulation, agreement, grant, usage, sufferance and other lawful means, the Governor General of India in Council has power and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> within divers places beyond the limits of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> India." It is by virtue of this legislative provision, that the Divorce Act (IV of 1809, as amended by Acts XI of 1889 and II of 1900), the Christian Marriage Act (XV of 1872, as amended by Acts II of 1891 and II of 1892), the Administrator General Act (II of 1874, as amended by Acts IX of 1890 and VI of 1900), Married Woman's Property Act (III of 1874), Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act (as amended by Act XVI of 1890) and Pilgrim Ships Act (XIV of 1895) have been made applicable to subjects of His Majesty within the dominions of Princes or States in India under the suzerainty of His Majesty.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government also exercises <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in some Native States over the subjects or a class of the subjects, of such states, which is called <em>residuary</em>; that is, what remains outside the actual sovereign powers exercised by the native princes. When any <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian</a> chief dies without an heir, or leaving a minor heir, or proves himself incapable of ruling, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government steps in and administers the affairs of the State through their agent, and exercises what has been named by Sir William Lee-Warner ("Protected Princes of India", p. 330), <em>substituted</em> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In such case it is the Governor-General of India or the local governors that conduct the administration, while the British Indian Legislatures are unable to extend their authority over the native subjects of Indian Princes or their territory. It is the prerogative of the Crown and not of the British-Indian Legislatures, whose enactments may be introduced only by the British executive authority by means of special orders. In the exercise of the <em>substituted</em> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as in Mysore during a long minority administration, a large number of Indian legislative enactments have been introduced in several Native States. The Native States administrations have also built up their legislative code on the model of the British- Indian legislation. Thus we shall find that there is no State in which the Indian Penal Code or some code like it has not been introduced with all the provisions relating to offences against religion (Sections 296-298, Indian Penal Code). But there is not a single Native State which can boast among its legislative achievements any enactments similar to the Caste and Religious Disabilities Act (XXI of 1851), which declares as illegal "such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or usages as inflict on any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> forfeiture of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or may be held in any way to impair or affect any right of inheritance, by reason of his renouncing or having been excluded from the communion of any religion or being deprived of caste". It is a masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> statesmanship and policy of toleration and equal protection of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. That it should not find a place in the statute book of a State like Mysore governed on the highest liberal principles, in which a native <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of the State rose to the eminent position of a judge of the Mysore High Court and then that of a member of the Council of Administration, and in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> thrives splendidly side by side with <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> and every other religion, is an enigma which outsiders are at a loss to understand. The agitation for the introduction of legislation along the lines of the British-Indian enactment in the large Native States of <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a> and Travancore has failed woefully.

<p>But for this flaw in the administration of the Native States, it must be said to their credit that the principle of <a href="../cathen/14763a.htm">religious toleration</a> has been generally respected by Indian princes and rulers. There have been some rare instances in which the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government has found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to interfere on the score of religious intolerance of a chief. One of the notable cases was the refusal of Lord Ripon to allow the Maharajah of Indore to restrict the freedom of religious worship of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> missionaries within their own houses and in their own premises, a privilege which has extended to their converts and dependents, the native subjects of His Highness. Though there are native rulers, who have not surrendered a jot of their internal sovereignty over their native subjects, yet their very existence is tolerated and guaranteed on the condition of their maintaining a just and peaceful administration combined with toleration of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> &#151; if not equal protection of all religious bodies and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. The latter condition of equal protection could not be exacted from Indian chiefs by a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Government which boasts of an established Church supported by the State at home &#151; though it has practically kept itself free from such an entanglement in India. So every Indian State has its established church &#151; generally that of the religion of the chief &#151; maintained out of public funds. Many a ruler has at the same time extended his patronage to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities other than that to which he belongs by grants of land to their places of worship and nemnuks or allowances to their religious <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. There are numerous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> in native States, which have received large grants-in-aid from Indian chiefs and darbars. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries are generally treated with marked respect and receive every courtesy from darbars and their officers. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religious propaganda is, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, looked upon with disfavour by the people, especially those of higher castes of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, and with the almost impassable barriers of caste or fanaticism the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is necessarily slow in India, and slower still in most Native States which support an established church. Foreign missionaries in some States suffer from the prohibition against their acquiring lands, but this prohibition does not apply to native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in whose names any number of lands can be purchased for the use of missions. On the whole, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries have to be thankful for the liberal principles on which native administrations are conducted under the guiding hand of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Ecclesiastical Literature. &#151; From the Catholic point of view nothing in the way of a complete general history of the Church in India has yet been written, though the materials for such a work are abundant and might easily be collected. They consist chiefly of the records and histories of the different religious orders, collections of official documents, monographs on particular missions and biographies of eminent missionaries &#151; as well as occasional literature of various kinds. Some rather scanty general histories have been written by Protestants; but most of them are vitiated by a marked animus against Roman Catholicism, and have to be read with caution.
