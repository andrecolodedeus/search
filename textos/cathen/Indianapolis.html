<p>(INDIANAOLITANA)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, established as the Diocese of Vincennes in 1834, but by brief <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 28 March, and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> 30 April, 1898, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> changed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Indianapolis. It comprises the southern half of the <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">State of Indiana</a>, south of Fountain, Montgomery, Boone, <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>, Madison, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, Randolph, and Warren counties, an area of 18,479 square miles. In 1834 the diocese extended over <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> and eastern Illinois and was detached from the then Diocese of Bardstown. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> history of Vincennes runs back to the establishment there of a fort by some French traders in 1702 and it takes its name from one of these intrepid <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> explorers. In the settlement that grew up about it, as through all the Illinois, Kaskaskia, and <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> country, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> settled and rude churches were built for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and Recollect missionaries who from time to time visited or were stationed among them. Pere Sebastian Meurin, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, settled there in 1764 to care for the desolate <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and disorganized congregations. The British having taken possession of this territory in 1763, it formed part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, who lived at Kaskaskia, and occasionally visited Vincennes, which had no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1769 he sent there Pierre Gibault, "the patriot <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the West," who spent two months reviving religion among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the district, about seven hundred in all. This was the same Father Gibault who, when Col. George Rogers Clark captured Vincennes in 1779 for the cause of the revolting colonies, was chiefly instrumental in persuading the settlers of this part of the West to throw their fortunes against the English and immediately accept the new government of the colonies.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was poor and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, scattered widely, without <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> except a few who belonged to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. To rule over them Rev. Simon William Gabriel Brut&eacute; de R&eacute;mur was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 28 October, 1834. "No <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, not one except those from other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Having come alone, I reside alone in a most depressing situation," he wrote after having made a tour of his charge. He went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to seek help, in July, 1835, and returned to Vincennes in August, 1836, bringing back nineteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and seminarians and enough money to start a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, to finish a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Vincennes and to aid several small churches elsewhere. This whole western section awakened to new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> under his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> inspiration, but the hardships of the missionary field broke down his strength and he died 26 June, 1839.

<p>Celestine Rene Laurent Guynemer de la Hailandiere, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, succeeded him as second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Born 2 May, 1798, at Friandin, near Cambourg, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 28 May, 1825, and volunteered for the American missions in 1836. He had returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and was begging for aid in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> when he was named titular of Axierne and coadjutor to Bishop Brute, who died, however, before the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 18 August 1839. In 1841 he estimated the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the diocese at about 25,000, attended by 33 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The same year he introduced the <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a> (the present important foundation at Notre Dame) into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, also the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a> to take charge of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and the Sisters of Providence. He subsequently became discontented with the lack of harmony between himself and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 16 July, 1847, but took no titular appointment. He died in his native town to which he had retired, 1 May, 1882.

<p><a href="../cathen/02361b.htm">Jean Etienne Bazin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, was appointed third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 Oct., 1847. He was born at Duerne, near <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 15 Oct., 1796, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 22 July, 1822. He left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to minister in Mobile in October, 1830. He manifested great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> on taking charge of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; but he died 23 April, 1848.

<p>Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 14 January, 1849. Born 15 November, 1811, at La Salvetat, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 28 May, 1836, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, where he took up the work of a missionary. After his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he made an official visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where he found about 30,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 35 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, among whom he at once infused a hearty spirit of activity. He introduced a foundation of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> in 1849, and began an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>. Under his direction the diocese increased steadily, the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> rose to 104, churches to 145 and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population to about 80,000, with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and other institutions. He died 28 June, 1877.

<p>Francis Silas Chatard, then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the North American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was appointed the fifth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 May, 1878. He was born in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 13 December, 1834, and studied at <a href="../cathen/10605a.htm">Mount St. Mary's</a> college, Emmitsburg. He then took up the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> and received the degree of doctor at the University of Maryland, but soon decided to enter <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, became a student at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> there in June, 1862, winning the doctor's degree the following year. In 1868 he succeeded Rt. Rev. William G. McCloskey as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the American College, having for several years previously been associated with its administration.

<p>In 1900 Bishop Chatard asked for an auxiliary and Rev. Denis O'Donoghue, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Patrick's Church, Indianapolis, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 April, 1900, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pomario and auxiliary to Bishop Chatard. Bishop O'Donoghue was born 30 Nov., 1848, in Davies County, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, and received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at St. Meinrad's College, and at St. Thomas' Seminary, Bardstown, Kentucky. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Sulpician Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 6 Sept., 1874. He served as chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for twenty-one years.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities now established in the diocese include: Men, 172 &mdash; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (St. Louis and Cincinnati provinces and Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>), <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a>, 1762 &mdash; Sisters of St. Benedict, Sisters of Charity, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, Sisters of St. Francis, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Sisters of Providence, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a>.
