<h1>Indifferent Acts</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> may be considered in the abstract (<em>in specie</em>) or in the concrete (<em>in individuo</em>). Taken in the former sense it is clear the morality of a <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human act</a> will be determined by its object only, as this may be of a kind that is neither conformable to a moral norm nor contrary to it, we may have an act that can be said to be neither good nor bad, but indifferent. But can this character of indifference be predicated of the act we are discussing, considered not as an abstraction of the mind, but in the concrete, as it is exercised by the individual in particular circumstances, and for a certain end?

<p>To this question <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> (in 2, dist. 41, a. 1, q. 3, where, however, it will be observed, the Seraphic Doctor speaks directly of merit only) answers in the affirmative, and with him <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> (in 2, dist. 40-41, et quodl. 18), and all the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotist</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. So also <a href="../cathen/14236a.htm">Sporer</a> (Theol. Moral., 1, III, &#167; v); <a href="../cathen/16037c.htm">Elbel</a> (Theol. Moral., tom. I, n. 86); Vasquez (in 1-2, disp. 52); <a href="../cathen/01753b.htm">Arriaga</a> (De Act. Hum., disp. 21); and in our own day Archbishop Walsh (De Act. Hum., n. 588 sq.). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (In 2, dist. 40., a. 5; De Malo, q. 2, a. 4 et 5; 1-2, q. 18, a. 9), and his commentators hold the opposite opinion. So too do Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De. Bon. Et Mal., disp. Ix); Billuart (diss. IV, a. 5 et 6); <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> (L. 2, n. XLIV); <a href="../cathen/02715b.htm">Bouquillon</a> (Theol. Moral. Fund., n. 371); Lehmkuhl (Theol. Moral., L. I, tract. I, III); and Noldin (Sum. Theol. Moral., I, 85 sq.).

<p>It must be noted that the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, no less than the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, recognize as morally indifferent acts done without deliberation, such, for instance, as the stroking of one's <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> or the rubbing of one's hands together, as these ordinarily take place. Admittedly indifferent, too, will those acts be in which there is but a physical deliberation, as it is called, such as is realized when, for instance, we deliberately read or write, without any thought of the moral order. The question here is of those acts only that are performed with advertence to a moral rule. Again, most of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> will allow that an act would be indifferent in the case where an agent would judge it to be neither good nor bad after he had formed his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, according to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, to which, it must be conceded, a solid probability is attached. Finally, it must be remarked that no controversy is raised regarding the indifference of acts with reference to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merit. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that all the works of <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has been formally condemned. Yet clearly, while the deeds of those without grace may be morally good, and thus in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> escape all demerit, they cannot, at the same time, lay claim to any merit.

<p>Both the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a> will declare that, to be morally good, an act must be in conformity with the exigencies and dignity of our rational nature. But the question is, what is to be reckoned as conformable to the exigencies and dignity of our rational nature? According to the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, the deliberate act of a rational being, to be morally good, must be referred to a positively good end. Hence those acts in which the agent adverts to no end, and which have for their object nothing that is either conformable to our rational nature, nor yet contrary to it, such as eating, drinking, taking recreation, and the like, cannot be accounted morally good. Since, however, these discover no deviation from the moral norm, they cannot be characterized as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and so therefore, it is said, must be considered as indifferent.

<p>According to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, which is the more common one among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in order to be morally good, that an act should be referred to a positively good end. It is enough that the end is seen to be not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that in the performance of the act the bounds set by right <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> be not transgressed. Thus the acts of eating, drinking, taking recreation, and the like, while, in the abstract, they are neither conformable nor contrary to our rational nature, in the concrete, by reason of the circumstance of their being done in the manner and the measure prescribed by reason, become fully in accord with our rational nature, and hence morally good. It will be observed from the foregoing that the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> hold as morally good the acts which the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a> maintain to be only morally indifferent.

<p>According to a third class of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, a deliberate act which is not referred to a positively good end must be reputed as morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence that which we have described as good in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and as indifferent to the mind of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, must according to these <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, be deemed nothing else than bad. Wrongly styled <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, the advocates of this opinion are one with the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> only in declaring that there are no indifferent deliberate acts. They differ from him radically in the unwarrantable rigour, and their teaching is condemned by the sense and practice of even the most delicately conscientious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.
