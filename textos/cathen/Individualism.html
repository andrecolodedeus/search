<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Individualism</h1>  

<p>A comprehensive and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> definition of this term is not easy to obtain. Individualism is not the opposite of <a href="../cathen/14062a.htm">socialism</a>, except in a very general and incomplete way. The definition given in the Century Dictionary is too narrow: "That theory of government which favours non-interference of the State in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>." This covers only one form of individualism, namely, political or civic.

<p>Perhaps the following will serve as a fairly satisfactory description: <em>The tendency to magnify individual liberty, as against external authority, and individual activity, as against associated activity.</em> Under external authority are included not merely political and religious governments, but <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> associations, and such forms of restraint as are found in general standards of conduct and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Thus, the labourer who refuses on theoretical grounds to become a member of a <a href="../cathen/08724a.htm">trade union</a>; the reformer who rejects social and political methods, and relies upon measures to be adopted by each individual acting independently; the writer who discards some of the recognized cannons of his art; the man who regards the pronouncements of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> as the only standard of right and wrong; and the <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinker</a> &#151; are all as truly individualists as the Evangelical <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> anarchist. Through all forms of individualism runs the note of emphasis upon the importance of <em>self</em> in opposition to either restraint or assistance from without. Individualism is scarcely a principle, for it exhibits too many degrees, and it is too general to be called a theory or a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Perhaps it is better described as a tendency or an attitude.
<h2>Religious individualism</h2>

<p>The chief recognized forms of individualism are religious, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, and political. Religious individualism describes the attitude of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who refuse to subscribe to definite creeds, or to submit to any external religious authority. Such are those who call themselves <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinkers</a>, and those who profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> without giving their adhesion to any particular denomination. In a less extreme sense all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are individualists in religion, inasmuch as they regard their individual interpretation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as the final authority. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> who places the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> adopted by his denomination before his own private interpretation of the teaching of Scripture is not, indeed, a thorough-going individualist, but neither is he a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> accept the voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the supreme authority, and therefore reject outright the principle of religious individualism.
<h2>Ethical individualism</h2>

<p>Ethical individualism is not often spoken of now, and the theories which it describes have not many professed adherents. Of course, there is a sense in which all men are <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> individualists, that is, inasmuch as they hold the voice of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to be the immediate rule of conduct. But <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> individualism means more than this. It means that the individual <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, or the individual reason, is not merely the decisive subjective rule, but that it is the only rule; that there is no objective authority or standard which it is bound to take into account. Among the most important forms of the theory are the intuitionism, or <a href="../cathen/04167a.htm">common-sense</a> morality, of the Scottish School (Hutchinson, Reid, Ferguson, and Smith), the autonomous morality of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, and all those systems of <a href="../cathen/07187a.htm">Hedonism</a> which make individual utility or pleasure the supreme criterion of right and wrong. At present the general trend of <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> theory is away from all forms of individualism, and toward some conception of social welfare as the highest standard. Here, as in the matter of religion, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are not individualists, since they accept as the supreme rule, the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, and as the final interpreter of that law, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>Political individualism</h2>

<p>Considered historically and in relation to the amount of attention that it receives, the most important form of individualism is that which is called political. It varies in degree from pure anarchism to the theory that the State's only proper functions are to maintain order and enforce contracts. In ancient <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, political theory and practice were anti-individualistic; for they considered and made the State the supreme good, an end in itself, to which the individual was a mere means.

<p>Directly opposed to this conception was the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching that the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had an independent and indestructible value, and that the State was only a means, albeit a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means, to individual welfare. Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, therefore, the ancient theory was everywhere rejected. Nevertheless the prevailing theory and practice were far removed from anything that could be called individualism. Owing largely to the religious individualism resulting from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, political individualism at length appeared: at first, partial in the writings of Hobbes and Locke; later, complete in the speculations of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the eighteenth century, notably Rousseau. The general conclusion from all these writings was that government was something artificial, and at best a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/04335a.htm">Social Contract theory</a> of Rousseau, the State was merely the outcome of a compact freely made by its individual citizens. Consequently they were under no moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to form a State, and the State itself was not a moral necessity. These views are no longer held, except by professional <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchists</a>. In fact, a sharp reaction has occurred. The majority of non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and political writers of today approach more or less closely to the position of ancient <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or to that of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>; <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, or the State, is an organism from which the individual derives all his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and all his importance. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> remains as always midway between these extremes. It holds that the State is normal, natural, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, even as the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but that it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its own sake; that it is only a means to individual life and progress.

<p>Moderate political individualists would, as noted above, reduce the functions of the State to the minimum that is consistent with social order and peace. As they view the matter, there is always a presumption against any intervention by the State in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, a presumption that can be set aside only by the most evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to the contrary. Hence they look upon such activities as <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, sumptuary regulations, legislation in the interest of health, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and professional competency, to say nothing of philanthropic measures, or of industrial restrictions and industrial enterprises, as outside the State's proper province. This theory has a much smaller following now than it had a century or even half a century ago; for experience has abundantly shown that the assumptions upon which it rests are purely artificial and thoroughly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. There exists no <em>general</em> presumption either for or against state activities. If there is any presumption with regard to particular matters, it is as apt to be favourable as unfavourable. The one principle of guidance and test of propriety in this field is the welfare of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and of its component <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, as determined by experience. Whenever these ends can be better attained by state intervention than by individual effort, state intervention is justified.

<p>It is against intervention in the affairs of industry that present-day individualism make its strongest protest. According to the <em>laissez-faire</em>, or let alone, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of economists and politicians, the State should permit and encourage the fullest freedom of contract and of competition throughout the field of industry. This theory, which was derived partly from the political philosophy of the eighteenth century, already mentioned, partly from the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the individual has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the fullest measure of freedom that is compatible with the equal freedom of other <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and partly from the teachings of Adam Smith, received its most systematic expression in the tenets of the Manchester School. Its advocates opposed not only such public enterprises as state railways and telegraphs, but such restrictive measures as factory regulations, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing the hours of labour for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children. They also discouraged all associations of capitalists or of labourers. Very few individualists now adopt this extreme position. Experience has too frequently shown that the individual can be as deeply injured through an extortionate contract, as at the hands of the thief, the highwayman, or the contract breaker. The individual needs the protection of the State quite as much and quite as often in the former case as in any of the latter contingencies. As to state regulation or state ownership of certain industries and utilities, this too is entirely a question of expediency for the public welfare. There is no <em>a priori</em> principle &#151; political, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>, or religious &#151; by which it can be decided. Many individualists, and others likewise, who oppose state intervention in this field are victims of a fallacy. In their anxiety to safeguard individual liberty, they forget that reasonable labour legislation, for example, does not deprive the labourer of any liberty that is worth having, while it does ensure him real opportunity, which is the vital content of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> liberty; they forget that, while state control and direction of certain industries undoubtedly diminishes both the liberty and the opportunity of some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, it may increase the opportunities and the welfare of the vast majority. Both individualists and non-individualists aim, as a rule, at the greatest measure of real liberty for the individual; all their disagreement relates to the means by which this aim is to be realized.

<p>As in the matter of the necessity and justification of the State, so with regard to its functions, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position is neither individualistic nor anti-individualistic. It accepts neither the "policeman" theory, which would reduce the activities of the State to the protection of life and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the enforcement of contracts, nor the proposals of Socialism, which would make the State the owner and director of all the instruments of production. In both respects its attitude is determined not by any <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> theory of the appropriate functions of the State, but by its conception of the requisites of individual and social welfare.
