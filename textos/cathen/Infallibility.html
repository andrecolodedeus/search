<h2 id="i">True meaning of infallibility</h2>

<p>It is well to begin by stating the ecclesiological <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that are assumed to be established before the question of infallibility arises. It is assumed:

<ul> <li>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> founded His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a visible and perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; <li>that He intended it to be absolutely universal and imposed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> a solemn <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> actually to belong to it, unless inculpable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> should excuse them; <li>that He wished this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be one, with a visible corporate unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, government, and worship; and that <li>in order to secure this threefold unity, He bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their legitimate successors in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> &#151; and on them exclusively &#151; the plenitude of teaching, governing, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> powers with which He wished this Church to be endowed. </ul>

<p>And this being assumed, the question that concerns us is whether, and in what way, and to what extent, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has made His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be infallible in the exercise of her <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority.

<p>It is only in connection with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority as such that, practically speaking, this question of infallibility arises; that is to say, when we speak of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallibility we mean, at least primarily and principally, what is sometimes called <em>active</em> as distinguished from <em>passive</em> infallibility. We mean in other words that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is infallible in her objective definitive teaching regarding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, not that believers are infallible in their subjective interpretation of her teaching. This is obvious in the case of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, any one of whom may <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in his understanding of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching; nor is the general or even unanimous consent of the faithful in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> a distinct and independent organ of infallibility. Such consent indeed, when it can be verified as apart, is of the highest value as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what has been, or may be, defined by the teaching authority, but, except in so far as it is thus the subjective counterpart and complement of objective authoritative teaching, it cannot be said to possess an absolutely decisive dogmatic value. It will be best therefore to confine our attention to active infallibility as such, as by so doing we shall avoid the confusion which is the sole basis of many of the objections that are most persistently and most plausibly urged against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility.

<p>Infallibility must be carefully distinguished both from <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Inspiration</a> and from <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Inspiration</a> signifies a special positive Divine influence and assistance by reason of which the human agent is not merely preserved from liability to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> but is so guided and controlled that what he says or writes is truly the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is the principal author of the inspired utterance; but infallibility merely implies exemption from liability to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the author of a merely infallible, as He is of an inspired, utterance; the former remains a merely human document.

<p><a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a>, on the other hand, means the making known by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, supernaturally of some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hitherto unknown, or at least not vouched for by Divine authority; whereas infallibility is concerned with the interpretation and effective safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> already revealed. Hence when we say, for example, that some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> defined by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or by an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> is infallible, we mean merely that its inerrancy is Divinely guaranteed according to the terms of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not that either the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or the Fathers of the Council are inspired as were the writers of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> or that any new revelation is embodied in their teaching.

<p>It is well further to explain:

<ul><li>that infallibility means more than exemption from actual <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; it means exemption from the possibility of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; <li>that it does not require <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, much less imply impeccability in its organs; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and wicked men may be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> agents in defining infallibly; <li>and finally that the validity of the Divine guarantee is independent of the fallible arguments upon which a definitive decision may be based, and of the possibly unworthy human motives that in cases of strife may appear to have influenced the result. It is the definitive result itself, and it alone, that is guaranteed to be infallible, not the preliminary stages by which it is reached.</ul>

<p>If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bestowed the gift of prophecy on <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> who condemned <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs49">John 11:49-52</a>; <a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs14">18:14</a>), surely He may bestow the lesser gift of infallibility even on unworthy human agents. It is, therefore, a mere waste of time for opponents of infallibility to try to create a prejudice against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claim by pointing out the moral or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> shortcomings of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> or councils that have pronounced definitive <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions, or to try to show historically that such decisions in certain cases were the seemingly natural and inevitable outcome of existing conditions, moral, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and political. All that history may be fairly claimed as witnessing to under either of these heads may freely be granted without the substance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claim being affected.


<h2 id="ii">Proof of the Church's infallibility</h2>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is infallible in her definitions on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> is itself a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, which, although it was formulated ecumenically for the first time in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, had been explicitly taught long before and had been assumed from the very beginning without question down to the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. The teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> is to be found in Session III, cap. 4, where it is declared that "the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed, has not been proposed as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> discovery to be improved upon by human talent, but has been committed as a Divine deposit to the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to be faithfully guarded and infallibly interpreted by her"; and in Session IV, cap. 4, where it is <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> when he teaches <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> "enjoys, by reason of the Divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer wished His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be endowed in defining <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>". Even the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, it will be seen, only introduces the general <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallibility as distinct from that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> obliquely and indirectly, following in this respect the traditional usage according to which the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is assumed as an implicate of ecumenical magisterial authority. Instances of this will be given below and from these it will appear that, though the word <em>infallibility</em> as a technical term hardly occurs at all in the early councils or in the Fathers, the thing signified by it was understood and believed in and acted upon from the beginning. We shall confine our attention in this section to the general question, reserving the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> for special treatment. This arrangement is adopted not because it is the best or most <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, but because it enables us to travel a certain distance in the friendly company of those who cling to the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility while rejecting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims. Taking the evidence both scriptural and traditional as it actually stands, one may fairly maintain that it proves <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility in a simpler, more direct, and more cogent way than it proves the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> independently; and there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that this is so if we accept as the alternative to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility the vague and unworkable theory of ecumenical infallibility which most High-Church <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> would substitute for <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>. Nor are the Eastern <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Churches much better off than the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> in this respect, except that each has retained a sort of virtual <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in its own infallibility, and that in practice they have been more faithful in guarding the doctrines infallibly defined by the early ecumenical councils. Yet certain <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> and all the Eastern Orthodox agree with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in maintaining that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised infallibility to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, and we welcome their support as against the general <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> denial of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.
<h3>Proof from Scripture</h3>

<h4>1</h4>

<p>In order to prevent misconception and thereby to anticipate a common popular objection which is wholly based on a misconception it should be premised that when we appeal to the Scriptures for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallible authority we appeal to them merely as reliable historical sources, and abstract altogether from their inspiration. Even considered as purely human documents they furnish us, we maintain, with a trustworthy report of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sayings and promises; and, taking it to be a fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> said what is attributed to Him in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, we further maintain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their successors in the teaching office include the promise of such guidance and assistance as clearly implies infallibility. Having thus used the Scriptures as mere historical sources to prove that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> endowed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with infallible teaching authority it is no vicious circle, but a perfectly legitimate <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> procedure, to rely on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> authority for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what writings are inspired.

<h4>2</h4>

<p>Merely remarking for the present that the texts in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised infallible guidance especially to Peter and his successors in the primacy might be appealed to here as possessing an <em>a fortiori</em> value, it will suffice to consider the classical texts usually employed in the general <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallibility; and of these the principal are:

<ul> <li>Matthew 28:18-20; <li>Matthew 16:18; <li>John 14, 15, and 16; <li>I Timothy 3:14-15; and <li>Acts 15:28 sq. </ul>

<h5>Matthew 28:18-20</h5>

<p>In Matthew 28:18-20, we have <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> solemn commission to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> delivered shortly before His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>: "All power is given to me in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and in earth. Going therefore, teach ye all nations; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world." In <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs15">Mark 16:15-16</a>, the same commission is given more briefly with the added promise of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to believers and the threat of damnation for unbelievers; "Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved; but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not shall be condemned."

<p>Now it cannot be denied by anyone who admits that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> established a visible Church at all, and endowed it with any kind of effective teaching authority, that this commission, with all it implies, was given not only to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> personally for their own lifetime, but to their successors to the end of time, "even to the consummation of the world". And assuming that it was the omniscient <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Who spoke these words, with a full and clear realization of the import which, in conjunction with His other promises, they were calculated to convey to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and to all simple and sincere believers to the end of time, the only reasonable interpretation to put upon them is that they contain the promise of infallible guidance in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching made to the Apostolic College in the first instance and then to the hierarchical college that was to succeed it.

<p>In the first place it was not without reason that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> prefaced His commission by appealing to the fullness of power He Himself had received: "All power is given to me", etc. This is evidently intended to emphasize the extraordinary character and extent of the authority He is communicating to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; an authority, it is implied, which He could not personally communicate were not He Himself <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. Hence the promise that follows cannot reasonably be understood of ordinary natural providential guidance, but must refer to a very special <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> assistance.

<p>In the next place there is question particularly in this passage of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority &#151; of authority to teach the Gospel to all men &#151; if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise to be with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their successors to the end of time in carrying out this commission means that those whom they are to teach in His name and according to the plenitude of the power He has given them are bound to receive that teaching as if it were His own; in other words they are bound to accept it as infallible. Otherwise the perennial assistance promised would not really be efficacious for its purpose, and efficacious Divine assistance is what the expression used is clearly intended to signify. Supposing, as we do, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> actually delivered a definite body of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to be taught to all men in all ages, and to be guarded from change or corruption by the living voice of His visible Church, it is idle to contend that this result could be accomplished effectively &#151; in other words that His promise could be effectively fulfilled unless that living voice can speak infallibly to every generation on any question that may arise affecting the substance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching.

<p>Without infallibility there could be no finality regarding any one of the great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which have been identified historically with the very essence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; and it is only with those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in historical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> that the question need be discussed. Take, for instance, the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. If the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not infallible in her definitions regarding these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, what compelling reason can be alleged today against the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to revive the Sabellian, or the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, or the Macedonian, or the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> controversies, and to defend some interpretation of these mysteries which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>?

<p>One may not appeal to the inspired authority of the Scriptures, since for the fact of their inspiration the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be invoked, and unless she be infallible in deciding this one would be free to question the inspiration of any of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writings. Nor, abstracting from the question of inspiration, can it be fairly maintained, in face of the facts of history, that the work of interpreting scriptural teaching regarding these mysteries and several other points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that have been identified with the substance of historical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is so easy as to do away with the need of a living voice to which, as to the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, all are bound to submit.

<p>Unity of Faith was intended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be one of the distinctive notes of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority He set up was intended by His Divine guidance and assistance to be really effective in maintaining this unity; but the history of the early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant sects</a> proves clearly, what might indeed have been anticipated a priori, that nothing less than an infallible <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a> capable of acting decisively whenever the need should rise and pronouncing an absolutely final and irreformable judgment, is really efficient for this purpose. Practically speaking the only alternative to infallibility is private judgment, and this after some centuries of trial has been found to lead inevitably to utter <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>. If the early definitions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were fallible, and therefore reformable, perhaps those are right who say today that they ought to be discarded as being actually <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> or even pernicious, or at least that they ought to be re-interpreted in a way that substantially changes their original meaning; perhaps, indeed, there is no such thing as absolute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in matters religious! How, for example, is a <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> who takes up this position to be met except by insisting that definitive teaching is irreversible and unchangeable; that it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in its original sense for all time; in other words that it is infallible? For no one can reasonably hold that fallible <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching is irreformable or deny the right of later generations to question the correctness of earlier fallible definitions and call for their revision or correction, or even for their total abandonment.

<p>From these considerations we are justified in concluding that if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> really intended His promise to be with His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be taken seriously, and if He was truly the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, omniscient and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, knowing history in advance and able to control its course, then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is entitled to claim infallible <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority. This conclusion is confirmed by considering the awful sanction by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> authority is supported: all who refuse to assent to her teaching are threatened with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. This proves the value <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself set upon His own teaching and upon the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> commissioned to teach in His name; religious indifferentism is here reprobated in unmistakable terms.

<p>Nor does such a sanction lose its significance in this connection because the same penalty is threatened for disobedience to fallible disciplinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or even in some cases for refusing to assent to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching that is admittedly fallible. Indeed, every mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching, is punishable with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. But if one believes in the objectivity of eternal and immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he will find it difficult to reconcile with a worthy conception of the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> a command under penalty of damnation to give unqualified and irrevocable internal assent to a large body of professedly Divine <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the whole of which is possibly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Nor is this difficulty satisfactorily met, as some have attempted to meet it, by calling attention to the fact that in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system internal assent is sometimes demanded, under pain of grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions that do not profess to be infallible. For, in the first place, the assent to be given in such cases is recognized as being not irrevocable and irreversible, like the assent required in the case of definitive and infallible teaching, but merely provisional; and in the next place, internal assent is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> only on those who can give it consistently with the claims of objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> &#151; this <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, it is assumed, being directed by a spirit of generous loyalty to genuine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles.

<p>To take a particular example, if <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> who happened to be right while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal which condemned him was wrong, had really possessed convincing scientific evidence in favour of the heliocentric theory, he would have been justified in refusing his internal assent to the opposite theory, provided that in doing so he observed with thorough loyalty all the conditions involved in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of external obedience. Finally it should be observed that fallible provisional teaching, as such, derives its binding force principally from the fact that it emanates from an authority which is competent, if need be, to convert it into infallible definitive teaching. Without infallibility in the background it would be difficult to establish theoretically the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of yielding internal assent to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> provisional decisions.

<h5>Matthew 16:18</h5>

<p>In <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>, we have the promise that "the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail" against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is to be built on the rock; and this also, we maintain, implies the assurance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallibility in the exercise of her teaching office. Such a promise, of course, must be understood with limitations according to the nature of the matter to which it is applied. As applied to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, for example, which is essentially a personal and individual affair, it does not mean that every member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or of her <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is necessarily a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, but merely that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as whole, will be conspicuous among other things for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life of her members. As applied to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, however &#151; always assuming, as we do, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered a body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the preservation of which in its literal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was to be one of the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; it would be a mockery to contend that such a promise is compatible with the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has possibly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in perhaps the bulk of her dogmatic definitions, and that throughout the whole of her history she has been threatening men with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name for refusing to believe doctrines that are probably <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and were never taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. Could this be the case, would it not be clear that the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> can prevail and probably have prevailed most signally against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>?

<h5>John 14-16</h5>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> discourse to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> several passages occur which clearly imply the promise of infallibility: "I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, that he may abide with you forever. The spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> . . . he shall abide with you, and shall be in you" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs16">John 14:16, 17</a>). "But the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you" (ibid. 26). "But when he, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is come, he will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs13">John 16:13</a>). And the same promise is renewed immediately before the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs8">Acts 1:8</a>). Now what does the promise of this perennial and efficacious presence and assistance of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, mean in connection with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority, except that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Third Person of the Blessed Trinity</a> is made responsible for what the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their successors may define to be part of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching? But insofar as the Holy Ghost is responsible for Church teaching, that teaching is necessarily infallible: what the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> guarantees cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<h5>1 Timothy 3:15</h5>

<p>In <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs15">1 Timothy 3:15</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of "the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the church of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the pillar and ground of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>"; and this description would be something worse than mere exaggeration if it had been intended to apply to a fallible Church; it would be a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and misleading description. That <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, however, meant it to be taken for sober and literal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is abundantly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by what he insists upon so strongly elsewhere, namely, the strictly Divine authority of the Gospel which he and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> preached, and which it was the mission of their successors to go on preaching without change or corruption to the end of time. "When you had received of us", he writes to the Thessalonians, "the word of the hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who worketh in you that have believed" (<a href="../bible/1th002.htm#vrs13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). The Gospel, he tells the Corinthians, is intended to bring "into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/2co010.htm#vrs5">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>). Indeed, so fixed and irreformable is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that has been taught that the Galatians (1:8) are warned to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> any one, even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, who should preach to them a Gospel other than that which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> had preached. Nor was this attitude &#151; which is intelligible only on the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/04112a.htm">Apostolic College</a> was infallible &#151; peculiar to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and apostolic writers were equally strong in <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> those who preached another <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> than that which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had preached (cf. <a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs1">2 Peter 2:1 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs1">1 John 4:1 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#vrs7">2 John 7 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs4">Jude 4</a>); and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> makes it clear that it was not to any personal or private views of his own that he claimed to make every understanding captive, but to the Gospel which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had delivered to the <a href="../cathen/04112a.htm">Apostolic body</a>. When his own authority as an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> was challenged, his defense was that he had seen the risen Saviour and received his mission directly from Him, and that his Gospel was in complete agreement with that of the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (see, v.g., <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs2">Galatians 2:2-9</a>).

<h5>Acts 15:28</h5>

<p>Finally, the consciousness of corporate infallibility is clearly signified in the expression used by the assembled <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>: "It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you", etc. (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs28">Acts 15:28</a>). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the specific points here dealt with are chiefly disciplinary rather than dogmatic, and that no claim to infallibility is made in regard to purely disciplinary questions as such; but behind, and independent of, disciplinary details there was the broad and most important dogmatic question to be decided, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching, were bound to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> in its integrity, as <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the time observed it. This was the main issue at stake, and in deciding it the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> claimed to speak in the name and with the authority of the Holy Ghost. Would men who did not believe that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises assured them of an infallible Divine guidance have presumed to speak in this way? And could they, in so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a>, have misunderstood the Master's meaning?
<h3>Proof from Tradition</h3>

<p>If, during the early centuries, there was no explicit and formal discussion regarding <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility as such, yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in her corporate capacity, after the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, always acted on the assumption that she was infallible in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters and all the great <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teachers believed that she was so. Those who presumed, on whatever grounds, to contradict the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching were treated as representatives of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs18">1 John 2:18 sq.</a>), and were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>.

<ul><li>It is clear from the letters of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> how intolerant he was of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and how firmly convinced that the episcopal body was the Divinely <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and Divinely guided organ of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; nor can any student of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature deny that, where Divine guidance is claimed in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters, infallibility is implied. <li>So intolerant of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> that, as the story goes, when he met <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> on the street in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he did not hesitate to denounce the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to his face as "the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>". This incident, whether it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or not, is at any rate thoroughly in keeping with the spirit of the age and such a spirit is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a fallible Church. <li><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a>, who in the disciplinary <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">Paschal question</a> favoured compromise for the sake of peace, took an altogether different attitude in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> controversy with the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>; and the great principle on which he mainly relies in refuting the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is the principle of a living <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority for which he virtually claims infallibility. For example he says: "Where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, there also is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is there is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and every grace: for the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (Adv. Haer. III, xxiv, 1); and again, Where the charismata of the Lord are given, there must we seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, i.e. with those to whom belongs the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">ecclesiastical succession</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and the unadulterated and incorruptible word. It is they who . . . are the guardians of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> . . . and securely [<em>sine periculo</em>] expound the Scriptures to us" (op. cit., IV xxvi, 5). <li><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, writing from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standpoint, ridicules the suggestion that the universal teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can be wrong: "Suppose now that all [the Churches] have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> . . . [This would mean that] the Holy Spirit has not watched over any of them so as to guide it into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although He was sent by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and asked from the Father for this very purpose &#151; that He might be the teacher of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<em>doctor veritatis</em> &#151; "De Praescript", xxxvi, in P.L., II, 49). <li><a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> compares the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to an incorruptible virgin: <em>Adulterari non potest sponsa Christi, incorrupta est et pudica</em> (De unitate eccl.).</ul>

<p>It is needless to go on multiplying citations, since the broad fact is indisputable that in the ante-Nicene, no less than in the post-Nicene, period all <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> attributed to the corporate voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, speaking through the body of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in union with their head and centre, all the fullness of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> themselves had possessed; and to question the infallibility of that authority would have been considered equivalent to questioning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> and fidelity. It was for this reason that during the first three centuries the concurrent action of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> dispersed throughout the world proved to be effective in securing the condemnation and exclusion of certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and maintaining Gospel <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in its purity; and when from the fourth century onwards it was found expedient to assemble ecumenical councils, after the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, it was for the same reason that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decision of these councils were held to be absolutely final and irreformable. Even the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, for the most part recognized this principle in theory; and if in fact they often refused to submit, they did so as a rule on the ground that this or that council was not really ecumenical, that it did not truly express the corporate voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was not, therefore, infallible. This will not be denied by anyone who is familiar with the history of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries, and within the limits of this article we cannot do more than call attention to the broad conclusion in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which it would be easy to cite a great number of particular facts and testimonies.
<h3>Objections alleged</h3>

<p>Several of the objections usually urged against ecclesiastical infallibility have been anticipated in the preceding sections; but some others deserve a passing notice here.

<h4>1</h4>

<p>It has been urged that neither a fallible individual nor a collection of fallible <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> can constitute an infallible organ. This is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in reference to natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and would be also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as applied to Church authority if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were assumed to be a mere product of natural reason. But we set out from an entirely different standpoint. We assume as antecedently and independently established that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can supernaturally guide and enlighten men, individually or collectively, in such a way that, notwithstanding the natural fallibility of human intelligence, they may speak and may be known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> to speak in His name and with His authority, so that their utterance may be not merely infallible but inspired. And it is only with those who accept this standpoint that the question of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallibility can be profitably discussed.

<h4>2</h4>

<p>Again, it is said that even those who accept the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> viewpoint must ultimately fall back on fallible human reasoning in attempting to prove infallibility; that behind any conclusion that is proposed on so-called infallible authority there always lurks a premise which cannot claim for itself more than a merely human and fallible <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>; and that, since the strength of a conclusion is no greater than that of its weaker premise, the principle of infallibility is a useless as well as an illogical importation into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In reply it is to be observed that this argument, if valid, would prove very much more than it is here introduced to prove; that it would indeed undermine the very foundations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For example, on purely rational grounds I have only moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is infallible or that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the infallible mediator of a Divine Revelation; yet if I am to give a rational defense of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even in mysteries which I do not comprehend, I must do so by appealing to the infallibility of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But according to the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of the objection this appeal would be futile and the assent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> considered as a rational act would be no firmer or more secure than natural <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that the inferential process here and in the case of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility transcends the rule of formal <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> that is alleged. Assent is given not to the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> force of the syllogism, but directly to the authority which the inference serves to introduce; and this holds good in a measure even when there is question of mere fallible authority. Once we come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in and rely upon authority we can afford to overlook the means by which we were brought to accept it, just as a man who has reached a solid standing place where he wishes to remain no longer relies on the frail ladder by which he mounted. It cannot be said that there is any essential difference in this respect between Divine and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility. The latter of course is only a means by which we are put under subjection to the former in regard to a body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> once revealed and to be believed by all men to the end of time, and no one can fairly deny that it is useful, not to say <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for that purpose. Its alternative is private judgment, and history has shown to what results this alternative inevitably leads.

<h4>3</h4>

<p>Again, it is urged that the kind of submission demanded by infallible authority is incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of reason and of legitimate inquiry and speculation, and tends to give to one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his Creed a dry, formal, proud, and intolerant character which contrasts unfavourably with the warmhearted, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and tolerant <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the man who believes on conviction after free personal inquiry. In reply it is sufficient to say that submission to infallible authority implies no abdication of reason, nor does it impose any undue check on the believer's freedom to pursue inquiry and speculation. Were it so, how could one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in revealed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at all without being accused, as unbelievers do accuse <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, of committing <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> suicide? If one believes in revelation at all one does so in deference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> authority an authority that is surely infallible; and so far as the principle of the objection is concerned there is no difference between <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and Divine infallibility. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that professing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should recur to such an argument, which, if consistently urged, would be fatal to their own position. And as regards freedom of inquiry and speculation in reference to revealed doctrines themselves, it should be observed that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> freedom in this as in other matters does not mean unbridled licence. Really effective authoritative control is always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to prevent liberty from degenerating into <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, and in the sphere of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> &#151; we are arguing only with those who admit that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> delivered a body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that was to be held as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> &#151; from the very nature of the case, the only effective barrier against <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> &#151; the equivalent of political <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> &#151; is an infallible <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. This authority therefore, by its decisions merely curtails personal freedom of inquiry in religious matters in the same way, and by an equally valid title, as the supreme authority in the State, restricts the liberty of private citizens.

<p>Moreover, as in a well ordered state there remains within the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> a large margin for the exercise of personal freedom, so in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is a very extensive domain which is given over to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculation; and even in regard to doctrines that have been infallibly defined there is always room for further inquiry so as the better to understand, explain, defend, and expand them. The only thing one may not do is to deny or change them. Then, in reply to the charge of intolerance, it may be said that if this be taken to mean an honest and sincere repudiation of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, infallibilists must plead guilty to the charge; but in doing so they are in good company. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself was intolerant in this sense; so were His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>; and so were all the great champions of historical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in every age. Finally it is altogether <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, as every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> knows and feels, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which allows itself to be guided by infallible <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority is less intimately personal or less genuine in any way than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> based on private judgment. If this docile loyalty to Divine authority which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> implies means anything, it means that one must listen to the voice of those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has expressly appointed to teach in His name, rather than to one's own private judgment deciding what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> teaching ought to be. For to this, in final analysis, the issue is reduced; and he who chooses to make himself, instead of the authority which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has instituted, the final arbiter in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is far from possessing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the foundation of charity and of the whole <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life.

<h4>4</h4>

<p>Again it is urged by our opponents that infallibility as exercised by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has shown itself to be a failure, since, in the first place, it has not prevented <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body, and, in the second place, has not attempted to settle for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> themselves many important questions, the final settlement of which would be a great relief to believers by freeing them from anxious and distressing <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>. In reply to the first point it is enough to say that the purpose for which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> endowed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with infallibility was not to prevent the occurrence of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which He foresaw and foretold, but to take away all justification for their occurrence; men were left free to disrupt the unity of Faith inculcated by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the same way as they were left free to disobey any other commandment, but <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was intended to be no more justifiable objectively than <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. To reply to the second point we would observe that it seems highly inconsistent for the same objector to blame <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in one breath for having too much <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in their Creed and, in the next breath, to find fault with them for having too little. Either part of the accusation, in so far as it is founded, is a sufficient answer to the other. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as a matter of fact do not feel in any way distressed either by the restrictions, on the one hand, which infallible definitions impose or, on the other hand, by the liberty as to non-defined matters which they enjoy, and they can afford to decline the services of an opponent who is determined at all costs to invent a grievance for them. The objection is based on a mechanical conception of the function of infallible authority, as if this were fairly comparable, for example, to a clock which is supposed to tell us unerringly not only the large divisions of time such as the hours, but also, if it is to be useful as a timekeeper, the minutes and even the seconds. Even if we admit the propriety of the illustration, it is obvious that a clock which records the hours correctly, without indicating the smaller fractions of time, is a very useful instrument, and that it would be foolish to refuse to follow it because it is not provided with a minute or a second hand on the dial. But it is perhaps best to avoid such mechanical illustrations altogether. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> believer who has real <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the efficiency of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises will not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that the Holy Ghost Who abides in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Whose assistance guarantees the infallibility of her definitions, will also provide that any definition that may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or expedient for the safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching will be given at the opportune moment, and that such definable questions as are left undefined may, for the time being at least, be allowed to remain so without detriment to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<h4>5</h4>

<p>Finally, it is objected that the acceptance of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility is incompatible with the theory of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> development which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> commonly admit. But so far is this from being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it is impossible to frame any theory of development, consistent with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles, in which authority is not recognized as a guiding and controlling factor. For development in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense does not mean that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ever changes her definitive teaching, but merely that as time goes on and human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> advances, her teaching is more deeply analyzed, more fully comprehended, and more perfectly coordinated and explained in itself and in its bearings on other departments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It is only on the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> supposition that development means change in definitive teaching that the objection has any real force. We have confined our attention to what we may describe as the rational objections against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of infallibility, omitting all mention of the interminable <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> difficulties which <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have raised against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpretation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The necessity for noticing these latter has been done away with by the growth of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> successor of old-time <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. If the infallible Divine authority of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the historicity of His promises to which we have appealed be admitted, there is no reasonable escape from the conclusion which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has drawn from those promises.

<h2 id="iii">Organs of infallibility</h2>

<p>Having established the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallibility, we naturally proceed to ask what are the organs through which the voice of infallible authority makes itself heard. We have already seen that it is only in the episcopal body which has succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> that infallible authority resides, and that it is possible for the authority to be effectively exercised by this body, dispersed throughout the world, but united in bonds of communion with Peter's successor, who is its visible head and centre. During the interval from the council of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to that of their successors at <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a> this ordinary everyday exercise of episcopal authority was found to be sufficiently effective for the needs of the time, but when a crisis like the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> arose, its effectiveness was discovered to be inadequate, as was indeed inevitable by reason of the practical difficulty of verifying that fact of moral unanimity, once any considerable volume of dissent had to be faced. And while for subsequent ages down to our own day it continues to be theoretically <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may, by the exercise of this ordinary teaching authority arrive at a final and infallible decision regarding <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> questions, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> at the same time that in practice it may be impossible to prove conclusively that such unanimity as may exist has a strictly definitive value in any particular case, unless it has been embodied in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or, at least, in some definite formula such as the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>. Hence, for practical purposes and in so far as the special question of infallibility is concerned, we may neglect the so called <em>magisterium ordinarium</em> ("ordinary magisterium") and confine our attention to ecumenical councils and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<h3 id="IIIA">Ecumenical councils</h3>

<h4>1</h4>

<p>An ecumenical or general, as distinguished from a particular or provincial council, is an assembly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which juridically represents the universal Church as hierarchically constituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and, since the primacy of Peter and of his successor, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is an essential feature in the hierarchical constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it follows that there can be no such thing as an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> independent of, or in opposition to, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. No body can perform a strictly corporate function validly without the consent and co-operation of its head. Hence:

<ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to summon an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> belongs properly to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone, though by his express or presumed consent given <em>ante</em> or <em>post factum</em>, the summons may be issued, as in the case of most of the early councils, in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. For ecumenicity in the adequate sense all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should be summoned, but it is not required that all or even a majority should be present. <li>As regards the conduct of the deliberations, the right of presidency, of course, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or his representative; while as regards the decisions arrived at unanimity is not required. <li>Finally, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> is required to give ecumenical value and authority to <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees, and this must be subsequent to <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> action, unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by his personal presence and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, has already given his official ratification (for details see <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">G<font size=-2>ENERAL</font> C<font size=-2>OUNCILS</font></a>).</ul>

<h4>2</h4>

<p>That an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> which satisfies the conditions above stated is an organ of infallibility will not be denied by anyone who admits that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is endowed with infallible <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority. How, if not through such an organ, could infallible authority effectively express itself, unless indeed through the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>? If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised to be present with even two or three of His disciples gathered together in His name (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs20">Matthew 18:20</a>), <em>a fortiori</em> He will be present efficaciously in a representative assembly of His authorized teachers; and the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> whom He promised will be present, so that whatever the council defines may be prefaced with the Apostolic formula, "it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us." And this is the view which the councils held regarding their own authority and upon which the defender of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> insisted. The councils insisted on their definitions being accepted under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, while <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, for example, says that "the word of the Lord pronounced by the ecumenical synod of Nicaea stands for ever" (Ep. ad Afros, n. 2) and <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a> proves the unchangeable character of definitive <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> teaching on the ground that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has irrevocably confirmed its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> "universae fraternitatis irretractabili firmavit assensu" (Ep. 120, 1).

<h4>3</h4>

<p>It remains to be observed, in opposition to the theory of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> infallibility usually defended by High Church <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> that once the requisite <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation has been given the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions of an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> become infallible and irreformable; there is no need to wait perhaps hundreds of years for the unanimous acceptance and <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world. Such a theory really amounts to a denial of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> infallibility, and sets up in the final court of appeal an altogether vague and ineffective tribunal. If the theory be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were not the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> perfectly justified in their prolonged struggle to reverse Nicaea, and has not the persistent refusal of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> down to our own day to accept Ephesus and of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> to accept Chalcedon been sufficient to defeat the ratification of those councils? No workable rule can be given for deciding when such subsequent ratification as this theory requires becomes effective and even if this could be done in the case of some of the earlier councils whose definitions are received by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, it would still be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that since the Photian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> it has been practically impossible to secure any such consensus as is required &#151; in other words that the working of infallible authority, the purpose of which is to teach every generation, has been suspended since the ninth century, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have been falsified. It is consoling, no doubt, to cling to the abstract <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of an infallible authority but if one adopts a theory which represents that authority as unable to fulfil its appointed task during the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> life, it is not easy to see how this consolatory <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is anything more than a delusion.

<h3 id="IIIB">The pope</h3>

<h4>Explanation of papal infallibility</h4>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> has defined as "a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">divinely revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>" that "the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, when he speaks <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> &#151; that is, when in the exercise of his office as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and teacher of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> he defines, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> to be held by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; is, by reason of the Divine assistance promised to him in <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">blessed Peter</a>, possessed of that infallibility with which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Redeemer</a> wished His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be endowed in defining doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; and consequently that such definitions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> are irreformable of their own nature (<em>ex sese</em>) and not by reason of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> consent" (Densinger no. 1839 &#151; old no. 1680). For the correct understanding of this definition it is to be noted that:

<ul><li>what is claimed for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is infallibility merely, not impeccability or inspiration (see above under <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#I">I</a>). <li>the infallibility claimed for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the same in its nature, scope, and extent as that which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a whole possesses; his <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> teaching does not have to be ratified by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> in order to be infallible. <li>infallibility is not attributed to every <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> act of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but only to his <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> teaching; and the conditions required for <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> teaching are mentioned in the Vatican <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>:

<ul><li>The pontiff must teach in his public and official capacity as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and doctor of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, not merely in his private capacity as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, preacher or allocutionist, nor in his capacity as a temporal prince or as a mere ordinary of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It must be clear that he speaks as spiritual head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universal. <li>Then it is only when, in this capacity, he teaches some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> that he is infallible (see below, IV). <li>Further it must be sufficiently evident that he intends to teach with all the fullness and finality of his supreme Apostolic authority, in other words that he wishes to determine some point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in an absolutely final and irrevocable way, or to define it in the technical sense (see D<font size=-2>EFINITION</font>). These are well-recognized formulas by means of which the defining intention may be manifested. <li>Finally for an <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> decision it must be clear that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> intends to bind the whole Church. To demand internal assent from all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to his teaching under pain of incurring spiritual shipwreck (<em>naufragium fidei</em>) according to the expression used by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in defining the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. Theoretically, this intention might be made sufficiently clear in a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision which is addressed only to a particular Church; but in present day conditions, when it is so easy to communicate with the most distant parts of the earth and to secure a literally universal <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> acts, the presumption is that unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> formally addresses the whole Church in the recognized official way, he does not intend his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching to be held by all the faithful as <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> and infallible. </ul> </ul>

<p>It should be observed in conclusion that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility is a personal and incommunicable <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charisma</a>, which is not shared by any pontifical tribunal. It was promised directly to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and to each of Peter's successors in the primacy, but not as a prerogative the exercise of which could be <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> to others. Hence <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions or instructions issued by the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, even when approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the ordinary way, have no claim to be considered infallible. To be infallible they must be issued by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself in his own name according to the conditions already mentioned as requisite for <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> teaching.

<h4>Proof of papal infallibility from Holy Scripture</h4>

<p>From <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, as already stated, the special <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> infallibility is, if anything, stronger and clearer than the general <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the infallibility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a whole, just as the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his primacy is stronger and clearer than any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that can be advanced independently for the Apostolic authority of the episcopate.

<h5>Matthew 16:18</h5>

<p>"Thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> (Kepha)", said <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "and upon this rock (kepha) I will build my church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>). Various attempts have been made by opponents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims to get rid of the only obvious and natural meaning of these words, according to which Peter is to be the rock-foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the source of its indefectibility against the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. It has been suggested, for example, that "this rock" is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself or that it is Peter's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (typifying the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of future believers), not his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and office, on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is to be built. But these and similar interpretations simply destroy the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> coherency of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> statement and are excluded by the Greek and Latin texts, in which a kind of play upon the words <em>Petros</em> (Petrus) and <em>petra</em> is clearly intended, and still more forcibly by the original Aramaic which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> spoke, and in which the same word <em>K&ecirc;pha</em> must have been used in both clauses. And granting, as the best modern non-Catholic commentators grant, that this text of St. Matthew contains the promise that St. Peter was to be the rock-foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is impossible to deny that Peter's successors in the primacy are heirs to this promise &#151; unless, indeed, one is willing to admit the principle, which would be altogether subversive of the <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">hierarchial</a> system, that the authority bestowed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> was not intended to be transmitted to their successors, and to abide in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> permanently. Peter's headship was as much emphasized by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and was as clearly recognized in the infant Church, as was the enduring authority of the episcopal body; and it is a puzzle which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> finds it hard to solve, how those who deny that the supreme authority of Peter's successor is an essential factor in the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can consistently maintain the Divine authority of the episcopate. Now, as we have already seen, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> indefectibility is certainly implied in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise that the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and cannot be effectively secured without <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> infallibility; so that if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise means anything &#151; if Peter's successor is in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense the foundation and source of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> indefectibility &#151; he must by virtue of this office be also an organ of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> infallibility. The metaphor used clearly implies that it was the rock-foundation which was to give stability to the superstructure, not the superstructure to the rock.

<p>Nor can it be said that this argument fails by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> too much &#151; by proving, that is, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should be impeccable, or at least that he should be a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, since, if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be holy in order to overcome the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the example and inspiration of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> ought to be given by him who is the visible foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> indefectibility. From the very nature of the case a distinction must be made between <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> or impeccability, and infallible <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority. Personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is essentially incommunicable as between men, and cannot affect others except in fallible and indirect ways, as by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or example; but <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching which is accepted as infallible is capable of securing that <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> and consequent unity of Faith by which, as well as by other bonds, the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> visible Church were to be "compacted and fitly joined together" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs16">Ephesians 4:16</a>). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, of course, that infallible teaching, especially on moral questions, helps to promote <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> among those who accept, but no one will seriously suggest that, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had made the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> impeccable as well as infallible, He would thereby have provided for the personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of individual believers any more efficiently than, on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles, He has actually done.

<h5>Luke 22:31-32</h5>

<p>Here <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> says to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> and to his successors in the primacy: "Simon, Simon, behold <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for thee, that thy <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren." This special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was for Peter <em>alone</em> in his capacity as head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as is clear from the text and context; and since we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, it followed that to St. Peter and his successors the office was personally committed of authoritatively confirming the brethren &#151; other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and believers generally &#151; in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and this implies infallibility.

<h5>John 21:15-17</h5>

<p>Here we have the record of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> thrice-repeated demand for a confession of Peter's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and the thrice-repeated commission to feed the lambs and the sheep:

<blockquote><p>When therefore they had dined, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> said to Simon (Peter): Simon, son of John, do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me more than these? He said to him: Yes, Lord, you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you. He said to him: Feed my lambs. He said to him again: Simon, son of John, do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me? He said to him: Yes, Lord, you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you. He said to him: Feed my lambs. He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me? Peter was grieved, because he had said to him the third time: Do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me? And he said to him: Lord, you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things: you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you. He said to him: Feed my sheep.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the complete and supreme pastoral charge of the whole of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock &#151; sheep as well as lambs &#151; is given to St. Peter and his successors, and in this is undoubtedly comprised supreme <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority. But, as we have already seen, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority in the Church cannot be really effective in securing the unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> intended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, unless in the last resort it is infallible. It is futile to contend, as non <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have often done, that this passage is merely a record of Peter's restoration to his personal share in the collective Apostolic authority, which he had forfeited by his triple denial. It is quite probable that the reason why <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> demanded the triple confession of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was as a set-off to the triple denial; but if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words in this and in the other passages quoted mean anything, and if they are to be understood in the same obvious and natural way in which defenders of the Divine authority of the episcopate understand the words elsewhere addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> collectively, there is no denying that the Petrine and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims are more clearly supported by the Gospels than are those of a monarchical episcopate. It is equally futile to contend that these promises were made, and this power given, to Peter merely as the representative of the Apostolic college: in the texts of the Gospel, Peter is individually singled out and addressed with particular emphasis, so that, unless by denying with the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> the genuineness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words, there is no <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> escape from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position. Furthermore, it is clear from such evidence as the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> supply, that Peter's supremacy was recognized in the infant Church (see <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">P<font size=-2>RIMACY</font></a>) and if this supremacy was intended to be efficacious for the purpose for which it was instituted, it must have included the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> infallibility.

<h4>Proof of papal infallibility from Tradition</h4>

<p>One need not expect to find in the early centuries a formal and explicit recognition throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either of the primacy or of the infallibility of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the terms in which these doctrines are defined by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. But the fact cannot be denied that from the beginning there was a widespread acknowledgment by other churches of some kind of supreme authority in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> in regard not only to disciplinary but also to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> affairs. This is clear for example, from:

<ul><li><a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement's</a> Letter to the Corinthians at the end of the first century, <li>the way in which, shortly afterwards, <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius of Antioch</a> addresses the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; <li>the conduct of <a href="../cathen/15408a.htm">Pope Victor</a> in the latter half of the second century, in connection with the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">paschal controversy</a>; <li>the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a>, who lays it down as a practical rule that conformity with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Apostolicity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (Adv. Haer., III, iii); <li>the correspondence between <a href="../cathen/05009b.htm">Pope Dionysius</a> and his namesake at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in the second half of the third century; <li>and from many other facts that might be mentioned (see <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">P<font size=-2>RIMACY</font></a>).</ul>

<p>Even <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> recognized something special in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and some of them, like <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> in the second century and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and Caelestius in the first quarter of the fifth, appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the hope of obtaining a reversal of their condemnation by provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. And in the age of the councils, from <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a> onwards, there is a sufficiently explicit and formal acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>.

<ul><li><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, for example, voices the prevailing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiment when in reference to the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> affair he declares, in a sermon delivered at Carthage after the receipt of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent's</a> letter, confirming the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>: "Rome's reply has come: the case is closed" (<em>Inde etiam rescripta venerunt: causa finita est.</em> Serm. 131, c.x); <li>and again when in reference to the same subject he insists that "all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> bas been removed by the letter of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> of blessed memory" (C. Duas Epp. Pelag., II, iii, 5). </ul>

<p>And what is still more important, is the explicit recognition in formal terms, by councils which are admitted to be ecumenical, of the finality, and by implication the infallibility of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> teaching.

<ul><li>Thus the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/05491a.htm">Ephesus</a> (431) declare that they "are compelled" to condemn the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Nestorius "by the sacred canons and by the letter of our holy father and co-minister, <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>." <li>Twenty years later (451) the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, after hearing <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo's</a> letter read, make themselves responsible for the statement: "so do we all believe . . . Peter has spoken through <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo</a>." <li>More than two centuries later, at the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Third Council of Constantinople</a> (680-681), the same formula is repeated: "Peter has spoken through <a href="../cathen/01204c.htm">Agatho</a>." <li>After the lapse of still two other centuries, and shortly before the Photian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> drawn up by Pope Hormisdas was accepted by the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Fourth Council of Constantinople</a> (869-870), and in this profession, it is stated that, by virtue of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise: "Thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, etc."; "the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is preserved inviolable in the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>." <li>Finally the reunion <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1438-1445), repeating what had been substantially contained in the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Michael Palaeologus approved by the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (1274), defined "that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">holy Apostolic see</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> holds the primacy over the whole world; and that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> himself is the successor of the blessed Peter Prince of the Apostles and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Vicar of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the head of the whole Church, and the father and teacher of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and that to him in blessed Peter the full power of feeding, ruling and governing the universal Church was given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and this is also recognized in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> and in the sacred canons (<em>quemadmodum etiam . . . continetur</em>. </ul>

<p>Thus it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> introduced no new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> when it defined the infallibility of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but merely re-asserted what had been implicitly admitted and acted upon from the beginning and had even been explicitly proclaimed and in equivalent terms by more than one of the early ecumenical councils. Until the Photian Schism in the East and the Gallican movement in the West there was no formal denial of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, or of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility as an adjunct of supreme <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority, while the instances of their formal acknowledgment that have been referred to in the early centuries are but a few out of the multitude that might be quoted.

<h4>Objections alleged</h4>

<p>The only noteworthy objections against <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility, as distinct from the infallibility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large, are based on certain historical instances in which it is alleged that certain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> exercise of their office have actually taught <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> what has afterwards turned out to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The chief instances usually appealed to are those of Popes <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, Honorius, and Vigilius in the early centuries, and the <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> affair at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

<h5>Pope Liberius</h5>

<p><a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, it is alleged, subscribed an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> or <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> creed drawn up by the Council of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> St. Athanasius, the great champion of Nicaea, as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. But even if this were an accurate statement of historical fact, it is a very inadequate statement. The all-important circumstance should be added that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> so acted under pressure of a very cruel coercion, which at once deprives his action of any claim to be considered <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a>, and that he himself, as soon as he had recovered his liberty, made amends for the moral weakness he had been guilty of. This is a quite satisfactory answer to the objection, but it ought to be added that there is no evidence whatever that <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> ever <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> St. Athanasius expressly as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and that it remains a moot point which of three or four <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> creeds he subscribed, two of which contained no positive assertion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and were defective merely for the negative reason that they failed to insist on the full definition of Nicaea.

<h5>Pope Honorius</h5>

<p>The charge against <a href="../cathen/07452b.htm">Pope Honorius</a> is a double one: that, when appealed to in the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> controversy, he actually taught the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a> in his two letters to Sergius; and that he was condemned as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth Ecumenical Council</a>, the decrees of which were approved by <a href="../cathen/09157a.htm">Leo II</a>. But in the first place it is quite clear from the tone and terms of these letters that, so far from intending to give any final, or <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a>, decision on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> question at issue, Honorius merely tried to allay the rising bitterness of the controversy by securing silence. In the next place, taking the letters as they stand, the very most that can be clearly and incontrovertibly <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from them is, that Honorius was not a profound or acute <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and that he allowed himself to be confused and misled by the wily Sergius as to what the issue really was and too readily accepted the latter's misrepresentation of his opponents' position, to the effect that the assertion of two wills in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> meant two contrary or discordant wills. Finally, in reference to the condemnation of Honorius as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, it is to be remembered that there is no ecumenical sentence affirming the fact either that Honorius's letters to Sergius contain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or that they were intended to define the question with which they deal. The sentence passed by the fathers of the council has ecumenical value only in so far as it was approved by <a href="../cathen/09157a.htm">Leo II</a>; but, in approving the condemnation of Honorius, his successor adds the very important qualification that he is condemned, not for the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> reason that he taught <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but on the moral ground that he was wanting in the vigilance expected from him in his Apostolic office and thereby allowed a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to make headway which he should have crushed in its beginnings.

<h5>Pope Vigilius</h5>

<p>There is still less reason for trying to found an objection to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility on the wavering conduct of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> in connection with the controversy of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>; and it is all the more needless to delay upon this instance as most modern opponents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims no longer appeal to it.

<h5>Galileo</h5>

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> affair, it is quite enough to point out the fact that the condemnation of the heliocentric theory was the work of a fallible tribunal. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> cannot delegate the exercise of his infallible authority to the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, and whatever issues formally in the name of any of these, even when approved and confirmed in the ordinary official way by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, does not pretend to be <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> and infallible. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, of course, can convert <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions of the Holy Office, which are not in themselves infallible, into <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pronouncements, but in doing so he must comply with the conditions already explained &#151; which neither <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> nor <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> did in the <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> case.

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>The broad fact, therefore, remains <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that no <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a> of any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has ever been shown to be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>.

<h3 id="IIIC">Mutual relations of the organs of infallibility</h3>

<p>A few brief remarks under this head will serve to make the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> conception of ecclesiastical infallibility still clearer. Three organs have been mentioned:

<ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> dispersed throughout the world in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; <li>ecumenical councils under the headship of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and <li>the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself separately.</ul> Through the first of these is exercised what <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> describe as the <em>ordinarium magisterium</em>, i.e. the common or everyday teaching authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; through the second and third the <em>magisterium solemne</em>, or undeniably definitive authority. Practically speaking, at the present day, and for many centuries in the past, only the decisions of ecumenical councils and the <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> have been treated as strictly definitive in the canonical sense, and the function of the <em>magisterium ordinarium</em> has been concerned with the effective <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> and maintenance of what has been formally defined by the <em>magisterium solemne</em> or may be legitimately <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from its definitions.

<p>Even the <em>ordinarium magisterium</em> is not independent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In other words, it is only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in corporate union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the Divinely constituted head and centre of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mystical body, the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, who have any claim to share in the charisma by which the infallibility of their morally unanimous teaching is divinely guaranteed according to the terms of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises. And as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> supremacy is also an essential factor in the constitution of an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> &#151; and has in fact been the formal and determining factor in deciding the ecumenicity of those very councils whose authority is recognized by <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Eastern schismatics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> &#151; it naturally occurs to enquire how <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> infallibility is related to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>. Now this relation, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> view, may be explained briefly as follows:

<ul> <li>Theories of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> infallibility do not <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> stand or fall together, since in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> view the co-operation and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his purely <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> capacity are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, according to the Divine constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the ecumenicity and infallibility of a council. This has, <em>de facto</em>, been the formal test of ecumenicity; and it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> even in the hypothesis that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself were fallible. An infallible organ may be constituted by the head and members of a corporate body acting jointly although neither taken separately is infallible. Hence the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> teaching <a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a> and an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as its head are distinct organs of infallibility. <li>Hence, also, the Gallican contention is excluded, that an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> is superior, either in <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority, to a certainly legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and that one may appeal from the latter to the former. Nor is this conclusion contradicted by the fact that, for the purpose of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Western Schism</a> and securing a certainly legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> deposed <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, whose election was considered <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, the other probably legitimate claimant, <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, having resigned. This was what might be described as an extra-constitutional crisis; and, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has a right in such circumstances to remove reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and provide a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> whose claims would be indisputable, even an acephalous council, supported by the body of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout the world, was competent to meet this altogether exceptional emergency without thereby setting up a precedent that could be erected into a regular constitutional rule, as the Gallicans wrongly imagined. <li>A similar exceptional situation might arise were a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to become a public <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, i.e., were he publicly and officially to teach some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> clearly opposed to what has been defined as <em>de fide catholic&acirc;</em>. But in this case many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that no formal sentence of deposition would be required, as, by becoming a public <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would <em>ipso facto</em> cease to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This, however, is a hypothetical case which has never actually occurred; even the case of Honorius, were it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he taught the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a>, would not be a case in point.</ul>

<h2 id="iv">Scope and object of infallibility</h2>
<h3>1</h3>

<p>In the Vatican definition infallibility (whether of the Church at large or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>) is affirmed only in regard to doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; but within the province of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> its scope is not limited to doctrines that have been formally revealed. This, however, is clearly understood to be what <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> call the direct and primary object of infallible authority: it was for the maintenance and interpretation and legitimate development of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was endowed with this charisma. But if this primary function is to be adequately and effectively discharged, it is clear that there must also be <em>indirect</em> and <em>secondary</em> objects to which infallibility extends, namely, doctrines and facts which, although they cannot strictly speaking be said to be revealed, are nevertheless so intimately connected with <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that, were one free to deny the former, he would <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> deny the latter and thus defeat the primary purpose for which infallibility was promised by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This principle is expressly affirmed by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> when it says that "the Church, which, together with the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic office of teaching</a> received the command to guard the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, possesses also by Divine authority (<em>divinitus</em>) the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to condemn <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> falsely so called, lest anyone should be cheated by philosophy and vain conceit (cf. <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs8">Colossians 2:8</a>)" (Denz., 1798, old no. 1845).
<h3>2</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are agreed in recognising the general principle that has just been stated, but it cannot be said that they are equally unanimous in regard to the concrete applications of this principle. Yet it is generally held, and may be said to be theologically certain, (a) that what are technically described as "theological conclusions," i.e. inferences <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from two premises, one of which is revealed and the other verified by reason, fall under the scope of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> infallible authority. (b) It is also generally held, and rightly, that questions of <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">dogmatic fact</a>, in regard to which definite <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is required for the safe custody and interpretation of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may be determined infallibly by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such questions, for example, would be: whether a certain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is legitimate, or a certain council ecumenical, or whether objective <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is taught in a certain book or other published document. This last point in particular figured prominently in the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> controversy, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> contending that, while the famous five propositions attributed to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> were rightly condemned, they did not truly express the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> contained in his book "Augustinus". <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, in condemning this subterfuge (see Denz., 1350, old no. 1317) merely reasserted the principle which had been followed by the fathers of Nicaea in condemning the "Thalia" of Arius, by the fathers of Ephesus in condemning the writings of Nestorius, and by the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Second Council of Constantinople</a> in condemning the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. (c) It is also commonly and rightly held that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is infallible in the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that is to say, when <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> takes place according to the solemn process that has been followed since the ninth century. Mere <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, however, as distinguished from <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, is not held to be infallible, and in <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> itself the only fact that is infallibly determined is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> saint departed in the state of grace and already enjoys the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. (d) As to moral <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as distinct from moral <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, infallibility goes no farther than to protect the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against passing universal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which in principle would be immoral. It would be out of place to speak of infallibility in connection with the opportuneness or the administration of necessarily changing disciplinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> although, of course, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> believe that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receives appropriate Divine guidance in this and in similar matters where practical spiritual wisdom is required.

<h2 id="v">What teaching is infallible?</h2>

<p>A word or two under this head, summarizing what has been already explained in this and in other articles will suffice.

<p>As regards matter, only doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and facts so intimately connected with these as to require infallible determination, fall under the scope of infallible <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teaching. These doctrines or facts need not necessarily be revealed; it is enough if the revealed deposit cannot be adequately and effectively guarded and explained, unless they are infallibly determined.

<p>As to the organ of authority by which such doctrines or facts are determined, three possible organs exist. One of these, the <em>magisterium ordinarium</em>, is liable to be somewhat indefinite in its pronouncements and, as a consequence, practically ineffective as an organ. The other two, however, are adequately efficient organs, and when they definitively decide any question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> that may arise, no believer who pays due attention to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises can consistently refuse to assent with absolute and irrevocable <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> to their teaching.

<p>But before being bound to give such an assent, the believer has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be certain that the teaching in question is definitive (since only definitive teaching is infallible); and the means by which the definitive intention, whether of a council or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, may be recognized have been stated above. It need only be added here that not everything in a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pronouncement, in which some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is defined, is to be treated as definitive and infallible. For example, in the lengthy <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> defining the Immaculate Conception the strictly definitive and infallible portion is comprised in a sentence or two; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in many cases in regard to <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decisions. The merely argumentative and justificatory statements embodied in definitive judgments, however <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and authoritative they may be, are not covered by the guarantee of infallibility which attaches to the strictly definitive sentences &#151; unless, indeed, their infallibility has been previously or subsequently established by an independent decision.
