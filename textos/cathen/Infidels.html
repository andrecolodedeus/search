<h1>Infidels</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>in</em>, privative, and <em>fidelis</em>.)

<p>As in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language those who by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> have received <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and have pledged Him their fidelity and called the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, so the name <em>infidel</em> is given to those who have not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The term applies not only to all who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of various kinds, but also to those who adore Him but do not recognize <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>; strictly speaking it may be used of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> also, though in early ages they were called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; for it is only through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that one can enter into the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Those however who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> but do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics of divers confessions are not called infidels but non-Catholics. The relation in which all these classes stand to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not the same; in principle, those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are subjects of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her children even though they be rebellious children; they are under her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or, at least, are exempt from them only so far as pleases the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Infidels, on the contrary, are not members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, according to the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: Quid mihi de his qui fortis sunt, judicare? (<a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 5:12</a>); they are entirely exempt from the canon law; they need to be enlightened and converted, not punished. Needless to say, infidels do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> state; if they receive <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is not through the channels established by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but by a direct personal inspiration, for instance, the grace of conversion. But their condition is not morally bad; negative infidelity, says <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II, q. x, a. 1), does not partake of the nature of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather of punishment, in the sense that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Faith is a consequence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. That is why the condemnation by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of proposition lxviii of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>: Infidelits pure negativa, in his quibus Christus non et praedicatus, peccatum est (purely negative infidelity in those to whom Christ has not been preached is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>), was fully justified. But it is different with regard to positive infidelity, which is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the most grievous of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, apostasy. Being endowed with reason, and subject to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, infidels are not excluded from the moral order; they can perform acts of natural virtue; and so the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> had to condemn proposition xxv of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> which declared that: Omnia infidelium opera peccata sunt, et philosophorum virtutes vitia (all works of infidels are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, and all the virtues of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are vices; cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, loc. cit., a. 4; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, Theol. dogm., III, thes. cxxvi and cxxvii). Daily experience moreover proves incontestably that there are infidels who really religious, charitable, just, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to their word, upright in their business, and faithful to their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. One can say of them, as the Scriptures say of <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius the centurion</a>, that their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and their <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs4">Acts 10:4</a>). It was especially among such well-meaning infidels that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Jesus</a> grew up, and it is from their ranks that she gains her recruits at the present day in missionary lands.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, mindful of the order of the Saviour: Go, teach all nations (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs12">Matthew 28:12</a>), has always considered the preaching of the Gospel among the infidels and their conversion by her apostolic missionaries to be one of her principal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. This is not the place to recall the history of the missions, from the labours of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the greatest of missionaries, and those who gave the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the Greek and Roman world, and those who converted the barbarian peoples, down through the ages when the phalanxes of religious men rushed to the conquest of the Orient, the Far East, and America, to the present-day pioneers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Jesus Christ</a>; the multitude of heroes and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the harvest of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have been won to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. Doubtless, we still are far from having but one fold and one shepherd ; nevertheless, there is not today a province or race of men so remote, but has not heard the name of Him by whom all men must be saved and has given children to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The work of the missions is placed, as is well known, under the care and direction of the congregation of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> that bears the admirable name <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Da Propaganda Fide</a> (for the propagation of the Faith), instituted by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> in 1622. Ever encouraged and developed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, it is the directing body on whom the evangelical labourers in infidel lands depend. It sends them forth and grants them their powers, it established the prefectures Apostolic and the vicariates, and it is the tribunal to whose decision the missionaries submit their controversies, difficulties, and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>.



<p>Thought there is a general <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to toil for the conversion of infidels, yet it is not incumbent on any particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, unless on those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> charged with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> who have infidels within their territory. For the distant fields of labour missionaries, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> offer themselves for the apostolic work, are recruited in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. Native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not excluded from the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and it is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the missionaries to provide themselves prudently with auxiliary workers in their missions. To draw the infidels to the Faith, the missionaries ought, like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, to make themselves all things to all men, adopt the customs of the country, acquire the native language, establish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, preach especially by their example, and show in their lives how the religion they have come to teach is to be practiced (cf. Instr. of the Prop. to the Vicars Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, in the Collectanea S. C. de Prop. Fide, n. 328). They and their catechists are to instruct with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and patience to those who are anxious to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, admitting them to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> after longer or shorter period of probation, as was done in the case of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> in ancient times. But the conversion of infidels must be free and without compulsion, otherwise it will not be genuine and lasting (cap. 9, tit. vi, lib. V, de Judaeis). It cannot be denied that at various epochs, notably under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and later in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, there were forced conversions, which may be explained, though not excused, by the custom of the age; but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not responsible for them, as it has constantly taught that all conversions should be free. On several occasions it expressly forbade the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and infidels against their will, and even the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children without their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> consent, unless they were in imminent danger of death (cf. Collect. cit., De subjecto baptismi). In the rite of administering <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> still asks the questions: Quid petis ab Ecclesia Dei? Vis baptizari?

<p>Though ecclesiastical law does not affect the acts of infidels as such, yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has to pass judgment on the validity of these acts and their juridical consequences when infidels come within the fold by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. No act of an infidel can have any value from the point of view of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> to which he does not belong; he is incapable by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, notably <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> (evidently we are not speaking here of a purely material reception); nor can he receive or exercise any <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. The acts of infidels are to be considered in the light of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, to which they, like all men, are subject, and in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, in so far as it determines the secondary <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. This applies principally to the case of matrimony. The marriage of infidels is valid as a contract under <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, not as a sacrament, though at times this word has been applied to it (cf. Encycl. Arcanum); it is subject only to the impediments of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and, at times, to those of the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> also, but it is not affected by the impediments of canon law. However the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not recognize <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> as lawful among infidels; as to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> strictly so called, it admits it only under the form of the Casus Apostoli, also known as the privilege of the Faith or the Pauline privilege; this consists in a convert being permitted to abandon his partner, who remains an infidel, if the latter refuse to continue the common life without endangering the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the convert (cf. <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">DIVORCE</a>, I, B, 1); under such circumstances the convert may marry a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. As to acts which are prohibited or void in virtue of canon law alone, they are valid when performed by infidels; thus, the impediment of the remoter degrees of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> and affinity, etc., does not affect the marriages of infidels. But the juridical consequences of the acts, performed by them when infidels, begin to exist at the moment of and in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; consequently, a converted widower may not marry a relative of his late wife without <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>; and again, a man who has had two wives before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> is a bigamist and therefore irregular.

<p>Most of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refer to the relations between its subjects and infidels in not only religious but also civil affairs. Speaking generally, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are forbidden to take part in any religious rites, considered as such, of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and all the more to practice them through a kind of survival of their primitive <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>. If this prohibition is inspired not so much by a fear of the danger of perversion as by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbidding the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to communicate in sacris with non-Catholics, aversion to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and especially from idol worship justifies the rigor of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. To mention but the principal acts, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are forbidden to venerate idols, not only in their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, but also in private houses, to contribute to the building or repairing of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> or of mosques, to carve idols, to join in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, to assist at Jewish <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcisions</a>, to wear <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> images or objects having an acknowledged religious significance, so that the fact of wearing them is looked upon as an act of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship, and finally to make use of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and especially <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> practices in the acts of civil or domestic life. Some very delicate questions may arise in connection with the last prohibition; for instance, we may recall the celebrated controversy concerning the Chinese rites (see <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">CHINA</a>). On the other hand, it is not forbidden to enter <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and mosques out of mere curiosity if no act of religion be performed, or to eat food that has been offered to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods, provided that this be not done in a temple or as a sacred repast, and that it be done without <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>; or to observe customs or perform acts which are not in themselves religious, even though <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> join <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices to them. Not only is it not forbidden, but it is permissible and one might say <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even publicly for infidel princes, in order that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may grant their subjects peace and prosperity; nothing is more conformable to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; thus <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the different rites in the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the sultan.

<p>In this place mention may be made of the ecclesiastical law forbidding the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to marry infidels, a prohibition which is now a diriment impediment, rendering a marriage null and void unless a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> has been obtained (see <a href="../cathen/05037b.htm">DISPARITY OF WORSHIP</a>). It is easy to see that there is a real danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party in the intimacy of married life and in the difficulties in the way of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children; and, if that party be the wife, in the excessive authority of the husband and the inferior condition of the wife in infidel countries; consequently, this <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is granted only with difficulty and when the precautions dictated by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> have been taken. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regulating the dealings between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and infidels in civil life were inspired also by religious motives, the danger of perversion, and the high <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> entertained in the ages of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the superiority of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to infidels. These regulations, of course, did not refer to all acts of civil life; moreover, they were not directed against all infidels indifferently, but only against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; at the present day they have fallen almost completely into desuetude. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were forbidden to have <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> forbade <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to enter the service of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to act as their nurses or midwives; moreover, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> when ill were not to have recourse to Jewish physicians. These measures may be useful in certain countries today and we find them renewed, at least as recommendations, by recent councils (Council of Gran, in 1858; Prague, in 1860; and Utrecht, in 1865). As for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, they were ordinarily restricted to certain definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted, and had to wear a dress by which they might be recognized. Modern legislation has given the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as other citizens and the intercourse between them and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in civil life is no longer governed by ecclesiastical law. (See <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">JEWS AND JUDAISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">MOHAMMED AND MOHAMMEDANISM</a>.)
