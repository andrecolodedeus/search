<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Inquisition</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>inquirere</em>, to look to).

<p>By this term is usually meant a special <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution for combating or suppressing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Its characteristic mark seems to be the bestowal on special judges of judicial powers in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this by supreme ecclesiastical authority, not temporal or for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> cases, but as a universal and permanent office. Moderns experience difficulty in understanding this institution, because they have, to no small extent, lost sight of two facts.

<p>On the one hand they have ceased to grasp <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> as something objective, as the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>, and therefore outside the realm of free private judgment; on the other they no longer see in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> perfect and sovereign, based substantially on a pure and <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a>, whose first most important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> must naturally be to retain unsullied this original deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a> of the sixteenth century these views were still common to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; that <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> should be maintained at any cost seemed self-evident.

<p>However, while the positive suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by ecclesiastical and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> society is as old as the Church, the Inquisition as a distinct <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical tribunal</a> is of much later origin. Historically it is a phase in the growth of ecclesiastical legislation, whose distinctive traits can be fully understood only by a careful study of the conditions amid which it grew up. Our subject may, therefore, be conveniently treated as follows: <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/08026a.htm#I">I. The Suppression of Heresy during the first twelve Christian centuries;</a> <li><a href="../cathen/08026a.htm#II">II. The Suppression of Heresy by the Institution known as the Inquisition under its several forms:</a> <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/08026a.htm#IIA">(A) The Inquisition of the Middle Ages;</a> <li><a href="../cathen/08026a.htm#IIB">(B) The Inquisition in Spain;</a> <li><a href="../cathen/08026a.htm#IIC">(C) The Holy Office at Rome.</a> </ul> </ul>

<h2 id="i">The suppression of heresy during the first twelve centuries</h2>

<p>(1) Though the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> were deeply imbued with the conviction that they must transmit the deposit of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> to posterity undefiled, and that any teaching at variance with their own, even if proclaimed by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, would be a culpable offense, yet <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> did not, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> Alexander and Hymeneus, go back to the Old Covenant penalties of death or scourging (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#vrs6">Deuteronomy 13:6 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#vrs1">17:1 sqq.</a>), but deemed exclusion from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sufficient (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs20">1 Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs10">Titus 3:10</a>). In fact to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the first three centuries it could scarcely have occurred to assume any other attitude towards those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0305.htm"><em>To Scapula</em> 2</a>) lays down the rule:

<blockquote><p>Humani iuris et naturalis potestatis, unicuique quod putaverit colere, nec alii obest aut prodest alterius religio. Sed nec religionis est religionem colere, quae sponte suscipi debeat, non vi. </p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, he tells us that the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> authorized <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to follow only the voice of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in the practice of religion, since the acceptance of religion was a matter of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, not of compulsion. Replying to the accusation of <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a>, based on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> dissidents with death, burning, and torture, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/04167.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VII.26</a>) is satisfied with explaining that one must distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> received from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and that given to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; the former was binding on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the latter on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, if sincere, could no longer conform to all of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a>; hence they were no longer at liberty to <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">kill</a> their enemies or to burn and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> violators of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Law.

<p><a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian of Carthage</a>, surrounded as he was by countless <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatics</a> and undutiful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, also put aside the material sanction of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which punished with death rebellion against <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the Judges. "Nunc autem, quia circumcisio spiritalis esse apud fideles servos Dei coepit, spiritali gladio superbi et contumaces necantur, dum de Ecclesia ejiciuntur" (<a href="../fathers/050661.htm">Epistle 61, no. 4</a>) religion being now spiritual, its sanctions take on the same character, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> replaces the death of the body. <a href="../cathen/08736a.htm">Lactantius</a> was yet smarting under the scourge of bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, when he wrote this <a href="../fathers/0701.htm"><em>Divine Institutes</em></a> in A.D. 308. Naturally, therefore, he stood for the most absolute freedom of religion. He writes:

<blockquote><p>Religion being a matter of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">will</a>, it cannot be forced on anyone; in this matter it is better to employ words than blows [verbis melius quam verberibus res agenda est]. Of what use is cruelty? What has the rack to do with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>? Surely there is no connection between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, between <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and cruelty . . . . It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that nothing is so important as religion, and one must defend it at any cost [summ&acirc; vi] . . . It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that it must be protected, but by dying for it, not by killing others; by long-suffering, not by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by crime. If you attempt to defend religion with bloodshed and torture, what you do is not defense, but <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> and insult. For nothing is so intrinsically a matter of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> as religion. <a href="../fathers/07015.htm#20">(<em>Divine Institutes</em> V:20)</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Christian teachers of the first three centuries</a> insisted, as was natural for them, on complete religious liberty; furthermore, they not only urged the principle that religion could not be forced on others &#151; a principle always adhered to by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her dealings with the unbaptised &#151; but, when comparing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, they taught that the latter was content with a spiritual punishment of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (i.e. with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>), while <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> necessarily proceeded against its dissidents with torture and death.

<p>(2) However, the imperial successors of Constantine soon began to see in themselves Divinely appointed "bishops of the exterior", i.e. masters of the temporal and material <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the same time they retained the traditional authority of "Pontifex Maximus", and in this way the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> inclined, frequently in league with <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> tendencies, to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and exile. But the latter, particularly <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a> (Liber contra Auxentium, c. iv), protested vigorously against any use of force in the province of religion, whether for the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> or for preservation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. They repeatedly urged that in this respect the severe decrees of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were abrogated by the mild and gentle <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. However, the successors of Constantine were ever persuaded that the first concern of imperial authority (Theodosius II, "Novellae", tit. III, A.D. 438) was the protection of religion and so, with terrible regularity, issued many penal edicts against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In the space of fifty seven years sixty-eight enactments were thus <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. All manner of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were affected by this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>, and in various ways, by exile, confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, or death. A <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 407, aimed at the traitorous <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, asserts for the first time that these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought to be put on the same plane as transgressors against the sacred majesty of the emperor, a concept to which was reserved in later times a very momentous role. The <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> however, was only imposed for certain kinds of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; in their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors fell far short of the severity of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, who in 287 sentenced to the stake the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and inflicted on their followers partly the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> by beheading, and partly forced labor in the government mines.

<p>So far we have been dealing with the legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> State. In the attitude of the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> some uncertainty is already noticeable. At the close of the forth century, and during the fifth, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianism</a> were the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> most in view. Expelled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Though they were found guilty of abominable teachings and misdeeds (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, De haeresibus", no. 46), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refused to invoke the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> against them; indeed, the great <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Bishop of Hippo</a> explicitly rejected the use force. He sought their return only through public and private acts of submission, and his efforts seem to have met with success. Indeed, we learn from him that the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves were the first to appeal to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> for protection against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. However, they fared like <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel's</a> accusers: the lions turned upon them. State intervention not answering to their wishes, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> excesses of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> being condignly punished, the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> complained bitterly of administrative cruelty. <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus of Mileve</a> defended the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> (De Schismate Donatistarum, III, cc. 6-7) as follows:<blockquote><p>. . . as though it were not permitted to come forward as avengers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to pronounce sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>! . . . But, say you, the State cannot punish in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet was it not in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Phineas consigned to death the worshippers of the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">Golden Calf</a> and those who despised the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion? </p></blockquote>This was the first time that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> championed a decisive cooperation of the State in religious questions, and its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to inflict death on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For the first time, also, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was appealed to, though such appeals had been previously rejected by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers.



<p>St. Augustine, on the contrary, was still opposed to the use of force, and tried to lead back the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> by means of instruction; at most he admitted the imposition of a moderate fine for refractory <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Finally, however, he changed his views, whether moved thereto by the incredible excesses of the <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> or by the good results achieved by the use of force, or favoring force through the persuasions of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Apropos of his apparent inconsistency it is well to note carefully whom he is addressing. He appears to speak in one way to government officials, who wanted the existing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> carried out to their fullest extent, and in another to the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, who denied to the State any <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of punishing dissenters. In his correspondence with state officials he dwells on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a>, and represents the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as straying lambs, to be sought out and perhaps, if recalcitrant chastised with rods and frightened with threats of severer but not to be driven back to the fold by means of rack and sword . On the other hand, in his writings against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> he upholds the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State: sometimes, he says, a salutary severity would be to the interest of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> ones themselves and likewise protective of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believers and the community at large (Vacandard, 1. c., pp. 17-26).

<p>As to <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianism</a>, not a few points remain yet obscure, despite recent valuable researches. It seems <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avila in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>, and found guilty by several councils. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and St. Damascus at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> seem to have refused him a hearing. At length he <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to Emperor Maximus at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, but to his detriment, for he was there condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian</a> himself, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in full <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of his own innocence, had formerly called for repression of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> by the sword. But the foremost <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers did not share these sentiments, and his own execution gave them occasion for a <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> protest against the cruel treatment meted out to him by the imperial government. <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, exerted himself to obtain from the ecclesiastical authority the abandonment of the accusation, and induced the emperor to promise that on no account would he shed the blood of <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian</a>, since ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would be punishment enough, and bloodshed would be opposed to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine Law</a> (<a href="../cathen/14332a.htm">Sulpicius Severus</a>, <a href="../fathers/35052.htm"><em>Chronicle</em> II</a> and <a href="../fathers/35032.htm"><em>Dialogue</em> III</a>). After the execution he strongly blamed both the accusers and the emperor, and for a long <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> refused to hold communion with such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as had been in any way responsible for <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian's</a> death. The great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, described that execution as a crime.

<p><a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianism</a>, however, did not disappear with the death of its originator; on the contrary, it spread with extraordinary rapidly, and, through its open adoption of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, became more of a public menace than ever. In this way the severe judgments of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> against <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianism</a> become intelligible. In 447 <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> had to reproach the Priscillianists with loosening the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bonds of marriage, treading all decency under foot, and deriding all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and Divine. It seemed to him natural that temporal rulers should punish such <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> madness, and should put to death the founder of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and some of his followers. He goes on to say that this redounded to the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "quae etsi sacerdotali contenta iudicio, cruentas refugit ultiones, severis tamen christianorum principum constitutionibus adiuratur, dum ad spiritale recurrunt remedium, qui timent corporale supplicium" &mdash; though the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was content with a spiritual <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> on the part of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and was averse to the shedding of blood, nevertheless it was aided by the imperial severity, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of corporal punishment drove the guilty to seek a spiritual remedy (<a href="../fathers/3604015.htm">Epistle 15</a>).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the first five centuries may be summarized as follows: <ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should for no cause shed blood (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a>, and others); <li>other teachers, however, like <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">Optatus of Mileve</a> and <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the State could pronounce the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in case the public welfare demanded it; <li>the majority held that the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, when not civilly criminal, was irreconcilable with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</ul> St. Augustine (<a href="../fathers/1102100.htm">Epistle 100, n. 1</a>), almost in the name of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">western Church</a>, says: "Corrigi eos volumus, non necari, nec disciplinam circa eos negligi volumus, nec suppliciis quibus digni sunt exerceri" &mdash; we wish them corrected, not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; we desire the triumph of (ecclesiastical) discipline, not the death penalties that they deserve. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> says substantially the same in the name of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> (<a href="../fathers/200146.htm"><em>Homily 46 on Matthew</em>, no. 1</a>): "To consign a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to death is to commit an offence beyond <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a>"; and in the next chapter he says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbids their execution, even as He forbids us to uproot cockle, but He does not forbid us to repel them, to deprive them of free speech, or to prohibit their assemblies. The help of the "secular arm" was therefore not entirely rejected; on the contrary, as often as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> welfare, general or domestic, required it, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rulers sought to stem the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by appropriate measures. As late the seventh century <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> expresses similar sentiments (Sententiarum, III, iv, nn. 4-6).

<p>How little we are to trust the vaunted impartiality of Henry Charles Lee, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">American</a> historian of the Inquisition, we may here illustrate by an example. In his "History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages" (New York, 1888, I, 215), He closes this period with these words:<blockquote><p>It was only sixty-two years after the slaughter of <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian</a> and his followers had excited so much horror, that <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> seemed to be reviving in 447, not only justified the act, but declared that, if the followers of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> so damnable were allowed to live, there would be an end to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. The final step had been taken and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> was definitely pledged to the suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> at any cost. It is impossible not to attribute to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence the successive edicts by which, from the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a>, persistence in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a>.</p></blockquote>In these lines Lee has transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> words employed by the emperor. Moreover, it is simply the exact opposite of historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to assert that the imperial edicts punishing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> with death were due to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence, since we have shown that in this period the more influential <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authorities declared that the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> was contrary to the spirit of the Gospel, and themselves opposed its execution. For centuries this was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> attitude both in theory and in practice. Thus, in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, some <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> were executed at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> in 556. On the other hand. Elipandus of Toledo and Felix of Urgel, the chiefs of <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">Predestinationism</a>, were condemned by councils, but were otherwise left unmolested. We may note, however, that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Gothescalch, after the condemnation of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not died for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, was by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 848 and <a href="../cathen/12608a.htm">Quiercy</a> in 849 <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentenced</a> to flogging and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, punishments then common in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for various infractions of the rule.

<p>(3) About the year 1000 <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> from <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, under various names, spread over Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. They were numerous in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> popular sentiment soon showed itself adverse to these dangerous sectaries, and resulted in occasional local <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, naturally in forms expressive of the spirit of the age. In 1122 King Robert the Pious (regis iussu et universae plebis consensu), "because he feared for the safety of the kingdom and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>" had thirteen distinguished citizens, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a>, burnt alive at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. Elsewhere similar acts were due to popular outbursts. A few years later the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> observed that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was spreading in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and asked of Wazo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, advice as to the use of force: "An terrenae potestatis gladio in eos sit animadvertendum necne" ("Vita Wasonis", cc. xxv, xxvi, in P.L., CXLII, 752; "Wazo ad Roger. II, episc. Catalaunens", and "Anselmi Gesta episc. Leod." in "Mon. Germ. SS.", VII, 227 sq.). Wazo replied that this was contrary to the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the words of its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>, Who ordained that the tares should be allowed to grow with the wheat until the day of the harvest, lest the wheat be uprooted with the tares; those who today were tares might to-morrow be <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>, and turn into wheat; let them therefore live, and let mere <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> suffice. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, as we have seen, had taught similar <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. This principle could not be always followed. Thus at Goslar, in the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> season of 1051, and in 1052, several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were hanged because <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> wanted to prevent the further spread of "the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> leprosy." A few years later, in 1076 or 1077, a <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharist</a> was condemned to the stake by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> and his <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapter</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharists</a>, in spite of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> intervention, were given their choice by the magistrates of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> between doing homage to the Cross and mounting the pyre. By far the greater number chose the latter. In 1114 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> kept sundry <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in durance in his episcopal city. But while he was gone to <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, to ask advice of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled there for a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> the "believing folk, fearing the habitual soft-heartedness of ecclesiastics (<em>clericalem verens mollitiem</em>), stormed the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> took the accused outside of town, and burned them.

<p>The people disliked what to them was the extreme dilatoriness of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in pursuing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In 1144 Adalerbo II of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> hoped to bring some <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharists</a> to better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, but the people, less indulgent, assailed the unhappy creatures and only with the greatest trouble did the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> succeed in rescuing some of them from death by fire. A like drama was enacted about the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> at Cologne, while the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> earnestly sought to lead the misguided back into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the latter were <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> taken by the mob (<em>a populis nimio zelo abreptis</em>) from the custody of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and burned at the stake. The best-known heresiarchs of that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, Peter of Bruys and <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, met a similar <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> &#151; the first on the pyre as a victim of popular <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">fury</a>, and the latter under the henchman's axe as a victim of his political enemies.

<p>In short, no blame attaches to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for her behavior towards <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in those rude days. Among all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the period, so far as can be ascertained, Theodwin of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, successor of the aforesaid Wazo and predecessor of Adalbero II, alone <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and even he did not call for the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a>, which was rejected by all. who were more highly respected in the twelfth century than Peter Canter, the most learned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of his time, and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a>? The former says ("Verbum abbreviatum", c. lxxviii, in P.L., CCV, 231):<blockquote><p>Whether they be convicted of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or freely confess their guilt, <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharists</a> are not to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, at least not when they refrain from armed assaults upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For although the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> said, <em>A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> that is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> after the third admonition, avoid</em>, he certainly did not say, <em>Kill him</em>. Throw them into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, if you will, but do not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a> (cf. Geroch von Reichersberg, "De investigatione Antichristi III", 42).</p></blockquote>So far was St. Bernard from agreeing with the methods of the people of Cologne, that he laid down the axiom: <em>Fides suadenda, non imponenda</em> (By persuasion, not by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, are men to be won to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>). And if he censures the carelessness of the princes, who were to blame because little foxes devastated the vineyard, yet he adds that the latter must not be captured by force but by arguments (capiantur non armis, sed argumentis); the obstinate were to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> kept in confinement for the safety of others (<em>aut corrigendi sunt ne pereant, aut, ne perimant, coercendi</em>). (See Vacandard, 1. c., 53 sqq.) The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the period employ substantially the same terms, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1049 under <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, that at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in 1119, at which <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> presided, and finally the <a href="../cathen/09017a.htm">Lateran Council of 1139</a>.

<p>Hence, the occasional <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">executions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> during this period must be ascribed partly to the arbitrary action of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> rulers, partly to the fanatic outbreaks of the overzealous populace, and in no wise to ecclesiastical law or the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. There were already, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, canonists who conceded to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to pronounce <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but the question was treated as a purely academic one, and the theory exercised virtually no influence on real life. <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a>, proscription, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, etc., were indeed inflicted, being intended rather as forms of <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a> than of real punishment, but never the capital sentence. The maxim of <a href="../cathen/11762a.htm">Peter Cantor</a> was still adhered to: "<a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharists</a>, even though divinely convicted in an <a href="../cathen/11276b.htm">ordeal</a>, must not be punished by death."

<p>In the second half of the twelfth century, however, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the form of <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharism</a> spread in truly alarming fashion, and not only menaced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> existence, but undermined the very foundations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. In opposition to this propaganda there grew up a kind of prescriptive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> &mdash; at least throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> &mdash; which visited <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> with death by the flames. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on the whole remained untainted by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. When, in 1166, about thirty sectaries made their way thither, Henry II ordered that they be burnt on their foreheads with red-hot iron, be beaten with rods in the public square, and then driven off. Moreover, he forbade anyone to give them shelter or otherwise assist them, so that they died partly from hunger and partly from the cold of winter. Duke Philip of Flanders, aided by William of the White Hand, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, was particularly severe towards <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. They <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> many citizens in their domains, nobles and commoners, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, peasants, spinsters, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, to be burnt alive, confiscated their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and divided it between them. This happened in 1183.

<p>Between 1183 and 1206 Bishop Hugo of Auxerre acted similarly towards the neo-Mainchaeans. Some he despoiled; the others he either exiled or sent to the stake. <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">King Philip Augustus of France</a> had eight <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharists</a> burnt at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in 1200, one at <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a> in 1201, several at Braisne-sur-Vesle in 1204, and many at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> &#151; "priests, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>". Raymund V of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1148-94) <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> which <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a> the followers of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and their favourers. <a href="../cathen/10540a.htm">Simon de Montfort's</a> men-at-arms <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in 1211 that they were carrying out this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> when they boasted how they had burned alive many, and would continue to do so (<em>unde multos combussimus et adhuc cum invenimus idem facere non cessamus</em>). In 1197 Peter II, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and Count of Barcelona, issued an edict in obedience to which the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> and all other <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatics</a> were expelled from the land; whoever of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was still found in his kingdom or his county after <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> of the next year was to suffer death by fire, also confiscation of goods.

<p>Ecclesiastical legislation was far from this severity. <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Lateran Council of 1179</a> renewed the decisions already made as to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatics</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and requested secular sovereigns to silence those disturbers of public order, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, to achieve which object they were at liberty to imprison the guilty (<em>servituti subicere, subdere</em>) and to appropriate their possessions. According to the agreement made by <a href="../cathen/09412b.htm">Lucius III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a> at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (1148), the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of every community were to be sought out, brought before the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">episcopal court</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and given up to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> to be suitably punished (<em>debita animadversione puniendus</em>). The suitable punishment (<em>debita animadversio, ultio</em>) did not, however, as yet mean <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">capital punishment</a>, but the proscriptive ban, though even this, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, entailed exile, expropriation, destruction of the culprits dwelling, <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, debarment from public office, and the like. The "Continuatio Zwellensis altera, ad ann. 1184" (Mon. Germ. Hist.: SS., IX, 542) accurately describes the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when it says that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them, and the emperor put them under the civil ban, while he confiscated their goods (papa eos excomunicavit imperator vero tam res quam personas ipsorum imperiali banno subiecit).

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> nothing was done to intensify or add to the extant <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, though this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave them a wider range by the action of his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and through the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215). But this act was indeed a relative service to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, for the regular canonical procedure thus introduced did much to abrogate the arbitrariness, passion, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the Civil courts in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In so far as, and so long as, his <a href="../cathen/12395b.htm">prescriptions</a> remained in force, no summary condemnations or executions en masse occurred, neither stake nor rack were set up; and, if, on one occasion during the first year of his pontificate, to justify confiscation, he appealed to the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> and its penalties for crimes against the sovereign power, yet he did not draw the extreme conclusion that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> deserved to be burnt. His reign affords many examples showing how much of the vigour he took away in practice from the existing penal code.

<h2 id="ii">The suppression of heresy by the institution known as the inquisition</h2>

<h3 id="IIA">The inquisition of the Middle Ages</h3>

<h4 id="i">Origin</h4>

<p>During the first three decades of the thirteenth century the Inquisition, as the institution, did not exist. But eventually <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was so endangered by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and penal legislation concerning <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharism</a> had gone so far, that the Inquisition seemed to be a political <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>. That these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> were a menace to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> had been long recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> rulers. As early as the tenth century Empress Theodora had <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> a multitude of <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, and in 1118 Emperor Alexius Comnenus treated the Bogomili with equal severity, but this did not prevent them from pouring over all Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Moreover these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> were in the highest degree aggressive, hostile to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself, to the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> and organization; hostile also to <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> government by their attitude towards <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, which they declared under no circumstances allowable. Nor were their views less fatal to the continuance of human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, for on the one hand they forbade marriage and the propagation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and on the other hand they made a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> through the institution of the <em>Endura</em> (see <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">CATHARI</a>). It has been said that more perished through the <em>Endura</em> (the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharist</a> <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> code) than through the Inquisition. It was, therefore, natural enough for the custodians of the existing order in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, especially of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, to adopt repressive measures against such revolutionary teachings.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Louis VIII decreed in 1226 that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or his delegate, should receive "meet punishment" (<em>debita animadversio</em>). In 1249 <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a> ordered barons to deal with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> according to the dictates of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> (<em>de ipsis faciant quod debebant</em>). A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1229) makes it appear probable that in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> death at the stake was already comprehended as in keeping with the aforesaid <em>debita animadversio</em>. To seek to trace in these measures the influence of imperial or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinances is vain, since the burning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had already come to be regarded as prescriptive. It is said in the "Etablissements de St. Louis et coutumes de Beauvaisis", ch. cxiii (Ordonnances des Roys de France, I, 211): "Quand le juge [eccl&eacute;siastique] laurait examin&eacute; [le suspect] se il trouvait, quil feust bougres, si le devrait faire envoier &agrave; la justice laie, et la justice laie le dolt fere ardoir."

<p>The "Coutumes de Beauvaisis" correspond to the German "Sachsenspiegel", or "Mirror of Saxon Laws", compiled about 1235, which also embodies as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> sanctioned by <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> the execution of unbelievers at the stake (<em>sal man uf der hurt burnen</em>). In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, as early as 22 November, 1220 (Mon. Germ., II, 243), issued a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, conceived, however quite in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> commissioned his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to see to the enforcement in Italian cities of both the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">canonical decrees</a> of 1215 and the imperial legislation of 1220.

<p>From the foregoing it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that up to 1224 there was no imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> ordering, or presupposing as legal, the burning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> for <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> of 1224 (Mon. Germ., II, 252; cf. ibid., 288) is accordingly the first <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in which death by fire is contemplated (cf. <a href="../cathen/06068a.htm">Ficker</a>, op. cit., 196). That <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> was in any way concerned in the drafting of this ordinance cannot be maintained; indeed the emperor was all the less in need of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> inspiration as the burning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was then no longer rare; his <a href="../cathen/09131d.htm">legists</a>, moreover, would certainly have directed the emperors attention to the ancient <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> that punished high treason with death, and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> in particular with the stake. The imperial rescripts of 1220 and 1224 were adopted into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> criminal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in 1231, and were soon applied at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was then that the Inquisition of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> came into being.

<p>What was the immediate provocation? Contemporary sources afford no positive answer. Bishop Douais, who perhaps commands the original contemporary material better than anyone, has attempted in his latest work (L'Inquisition. Ses Origines. Sa Procedure, Paris, 1906) to explain its appearance by a supposed anxiety of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to forestall the encroachments of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> in the strictly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> province of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. For this purpose it would seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to establish a distinct and specifically <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a>. From this point of view, though the hypothesis cannot be fully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, much is intelligible that otherwise remains obscure. There was doubtless reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> such imperial encroachments in an age yet filled with the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> contentions of the <em>Imperium</em> and the <em>Sacerdotium</em>. We need only recall the trickery of the emperor and his pretended eagerness for the purity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, his increasingly rigorous legislation against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the numerous executions of his personal rivals on the pretext of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the hereditary passion of the Hohenstaufen for supreme control over <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, their claim of God-given authority over both, of responsibility in both domains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only etc. What was more natural than that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should strictly reserve to herself her own sphere, while at the same time endeavouring to avoid giving offence to the emperor? A purely spiritual or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> religious tribunal would secure <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberty and authority for this court could be confided to men of expert <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and blameless <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and above all to independent men in whose hands the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could safely trust the decision as to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of a given teaching. On the other hand, to meet the emperor's wishes as far as allowable, the penal code of the empire could be taken over as it stood (cf. Audray, "Regist. de Gr&eacute;goire IX", n. 535).

<h4 id="ii">The new tribunal</h4>

<p><em>(a) Its essential characteristic</em>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not establish the Inquisition as a distinct and separate tribunal; what he did was to appoint special but permanent judges, who executed their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> functions in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Where they sat, there was the Inquisition. It must he carefully noted that the characteristic feature of the Inquisition was not its peculiar procedure, nor the secret <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a> of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> and consequent official indictment: this procedure was common to all courts from the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Nor was it the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in all places: this had been the rule since the Imperial Synod of Verona under <a href="../cathen/09412b.htm">Lucius III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>. Nor again was it the torture, which was not prescribed or even allowed for decades after the beginning of the Inquisition, nor, finally, the various sanctions, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, confiscation, the stake, etc., all of which punishments were usual long before the Inquisition. The Inquisitor, strictly speaking, was a special but permanent judge, acting in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and clothed by him with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to deal legally with offences against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; he had, however, to adhere to the established rules of canonical procedure and pronounce the customary penalties.

<p>Many regarded it, as <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> that just at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> sprang up two new orders, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, whose members, by their superior <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training and other characteristics, seemed eminently fitted to perform the inquisitorial task with entire success. It was safe to assume that they were not merely endowed with the requisite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but that they would also, quite unselfishly and uninfluenced by worldly motives, do solely what seemed their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">Good</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In addition, there was reason to hope that, because of their great popularity, they would not encounter too much opposition. It seems, therefore, not unnatural that the inquisitors should have been chosen by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> prevailingly from these orders, especially from that of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. It is to be noted, however, that the inquisitors were not chosen exclusively from the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, though the Senator of Rome no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> meant such when in his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of office (1231) he spoke of <em>inquisitores datos ab ecclesia</em>. In his decree of 1232 <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> calls them <em>inquisitores ab apostolica sede datos</em>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Alberic, in November of 1232, went through <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> as <em>inquisitor haereticae pravitatis</em>. The <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> and sub-prior of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Friesbach were given a similar commission as early as 27 November, 1231; on 2 December, 1232, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and a little later the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, also received the commission. In 1233 a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, touching these matters, was sent simultaneously to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were sent as inquisitors in 1232 to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> along the Rhine, to the <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Diocese of Tarragona</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>; in 1233 to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to the territory of Auxerre, the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical provinces</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Narbonne, and <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; in 1235 to the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. In fine, about 1255 we find the Inquisition in full activity in all the countries of Central and Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> &mdash; in the county of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Brabant, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (cf. Douais, op. cit., p. 36, and Fredericq, "Corpus documentorum inquisitionis haereticae pravitatis Neerlandicae, 1025-1520", 2 vols., Ghent, 1884-96).

<p>That <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, through his appointment of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> as inquisitors, withdrew the suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from the proper courts (i.e. from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>), is a reproach that in so general a form cannot be sustained. So little did he think of displacing episcopal authority that, on the contrary he provided explicitly that no inquisitional <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">tribunal</a> was to work anywhere without the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> co-operation. And if, on the strength of their <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, inquisitors occasionally manifested too great an inclination to act independently of episcopal authority, it was precisely the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who kept them within right bounds. As early as 1254 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> prohibited anew perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> or death at the stake without the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>. Similar orders were issued by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> in 1262, <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> in 1265, and <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> in 1273, until at last <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> solemnly declared null and void all judgments issued in trials concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, unless delivered with the approval and co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> always upheld with earnestness the episcopal authority, and sought to free the inquisitional tribunals from every kind of arbitrariness and caprice.

<p>It was a heavy burden of responsibility &#151; almost too heavy for a common mortal &#151; which fell upon the shoulders of an inquisitor, who was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, at least indirectly, to decide between <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and death. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was bound to insist that he should possess, in a pre-eminant degree, the qualities of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> judge; that he should be animated with a glowing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the extirpation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; that amid all difficulties and dangers he should never yield to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or passion; that he should meet hostility fearlessly, but should not court it; that he should yield to no inducement or threat, and yet not be heartless; that, when circumstances permitted, he should observe mercy in allotting penalties; that he should listen to the counsel of others, and not trust too much to his own opinion or to appearances, since often the probable is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> improbable. Somewhat thus did Bernard Gui (or Guldonis) and <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Eymeric</a>, both of them inquisitors for years, describe the ideal inquisitor. Of such an inquisitor also was <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> doubtlessly thinking when he urged <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad of Marburg</a>: "ut puniatur sic temeritas perversorum quod innocentiae puritas non laedatur" &#151; i.e., "not to punish the wicked so as to hurt the innocent". History shows us how far the inquisitors answered to this ideal. Far from being inhuman, they were, as a rule, men of spotless <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> and sometimes of truly admirable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and not a few of them have been <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. There is absolutely no reason to look on the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> as intellectually and morally inferior to the modern judge. No one would deny that the judges of today, despite occasional harsh decisions and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of a few, pursue a highly honourable profession. Similarly, the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> inquisitors should be judged as a whole. Moreover, history does not justify the hypothesis that the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were prodigies of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, deserving our sympathy in advance.

<p><em>(b) Procedure</em>

<p>This regularly began with a month's "term of grace", proclaimed by the inquisitor whenever he came to a heresy-ridden district. The inhabitants were summoned to appear before the inquisitor. On those who confessed of their own accord a suitable penance (e.g. a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>) was imposed, but never a severe punishment like <a href="../cathen/12436a.htm">incarceration</a> or surrender to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. However, these relations with the residents of a place often furnished important indications, pointed out the proper quarter for investigation, and sometimes much evidence was thus obtained against <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. These were then cited before the judges &#151; usually by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, although occasionally by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> &#151; and the trial began. If the accused at once made full and free confession, the affair was soon concluded, and not to the disadvantage of the accused. But in most instances the accused entered denial even after swearing on the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>, and this denial was stubborn in the measure that the testimony was incriminating. <a href="../cathen/04644a.htm">David of Augsburg</a> (cf. Preger, "Der Traktat des David von Augshurg uber die Waldenser", Munich, 1878 pp. 43 sqq.) pointed out to the inquisitor four methods of extracting open acknowledgment: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, i.e. by giving the accused to understand that the stake awaited him if he would not confess; <li>more or less close confinement, possibly emphasized by curtailment of food; <li>visits of tried men, who would attempt to induce free confession through friendly persuasion; <li>torture, which will be discussed below.</ul>

<p><em>(c) The Witnesses</em>

<p>When no <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> admission was made, evidence was adduced. Legally, there had to be at least two <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, although conscientious judges rarely contented themselves with that number. The principle had hitherto been held by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that the testimony of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurer</a>, in short, of an "infamous", was worthless before the courts. But in its destination of unbelief the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> took the further step of abolishing this long established practice, and of accepting a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> evidence at nearly full value in trials concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This appears as early as the twelfth century in the "Decretum Gratiani". While <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> readily assented to this new departure, the inquisitors seemed at first uncertain as to the value of the evidence of an "infamous" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. It was only in 1261, after <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> had silenced their <a href="../cathen/13640a.htm">scruples</a>, that the new principle was generally adopted both in theory and in practice. This grave modification seems to have been defended on the ground that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> conventicles took place secretly, and were shrouded in great obscurity, so that reliable information could be obtained from none but themselves. Even prior to the establishment of the Inquisition the names of the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> were sometimes withheld from the accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and this usage was legalized by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>. <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, however, set it aside by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ut commissi vobis officii" (Sext. Decret., 1. V, tit. ii); and commanded that at all trials, even inquisitorial, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> must be named to the accused. There was no personal confrontation of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, neither was there any cross-examination. <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">Witnesses</a> for the defence hardly ever appeared, as they would almost infallibly be suspected of being <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or favourable to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For the same reason those impeached rarely secured legal advisers, and were therefore <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make personal response to the main points of a charge. This, however, was also no innovation, for in 1205 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Si adversus vos" forbade any legal help for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: "We strictly prohibit you, lawyers and <a href="../cathen/11122a.htm">notaries</a>, from assisting in any way, by council or support, all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and such as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in them, adhere to them, render them any assistance or defend them in any way." But this severity soon relaxed, and even in Eymeric's day it seems to have been the universal <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> to grant <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> a legal adviser, who, however, had to be in every way beyond suspicion, "upright, of undoubted loyalty, skilled in civil and canon law, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p>Meanwhile, even in those hard times, such legal severities were felt to be excessive, and attempts were made to mitigate them in various ways, so as to protect the natural <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the accused. First he could make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the judge the names of his enemies: should the charge originate with them, they would be quashed without further ado. Furthermore, it was undoubtedly to the advantage of the accused that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> were punished without mercy. The aforesaid inquisitor, Bernard Gui, relates an instance of a father falsely accusing his son of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The son's innocence quickly coming to light, the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accuser was apprehended, and <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentenced</a> to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for life (<em>solam vitam ei ex misericordia relinquentes</em>). In addition he was pilloried for five consecutive <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> before the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> during service, with bare head and bound hands. <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">Perjury</a> in those days was accounted an enormous offence, particularly when committed by a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false witness</a>. Moreover, the accused had a considerable advantage in the fact that the inquisitor had to conduct the trial in co-operation with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his representatives, to whom all documents relating to the trial had to be remitted. Both together, inquisitor and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, were also made to summon and consult a number of upright and experienced men (<em>boni viri</em>), and to decide in agreement with their decision (<em>vota</em>). <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (11 July, 1254), <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> (15 April, 1255, and 27 April, 1260), and <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> (2 August, 1264) strictly prescribed this institution of the <em>boni viri</em> &#151; i.e. the consultation in difficult cases of experienced men, well versed in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and canon law, and in every way irreproachable. The documents of the trial were either in their entirety handed to them, or a least an abstract drawn up by a public <a href="../cathen/11122a.htm">notary</a> was furnished; they were also made acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses'</a> names, and their first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to decide whether or not the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> were credible.

<p>The <em>boni viri</em> were very frequently called on. Thirty, fifty, eighty, or more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> &#151; would be summoned, all highly respected and independent men, and singly sworn to give verdict upon the cases before them accordingly to the best of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Substantially they were always called upon to decide two questions: whether and what guilt lay at hand, and what punishment was to be inflicted. That they might be influenced by no personal considerations, the case would be submitted to them somewhat in the abstract, i.e., the name of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> inculpated was not given. Although, strictly speaking, the <em>boni viri</em> were entitled only to an advisory vote, the final ruling was usually in accordance with their views, and, whether their decision was revised, it was always in the direction of clemency, the mitigation of the findings being indeed of frequent occurrence. The judges were also assisted by a <em>consilium permanens</em>, or standing council, composed of other sworn judges. In these dispositions surely lay the most valuable guarantees for all objective, impartial, and just operation of the inquisition courts.

<p>Apart from the conduct of his own defence the accused disposed of other legal means for safeguarding his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>: he could reject a judge who had shown prejudice, and at any stage of the trial could <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Eymeric</a> leads one to infer that in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were not rare. He himself as inquisitor had on one occasion to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to defend in person his own position, but he advises other inquisitors against that step, as it simply meant the loss of much <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and money; it were wiser, he says, to try a case in such a manner that no fault could be found. In the event of an appeal the documents of the case were to be sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> not only scrutinized them, but itself gave the final verdict. Seemingly, <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were in great favour; a milder <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>, it was hoped, would be forthcoming, or at least some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> would be gained.

<p><em>(d) Punishments</em>

<p>The present writer can find nothing to suggest that the accused were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> during the period of inquiry. It was certainly customary to grant the accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> his freedom until the <em>sermo generalis</em>, were he ever so strongly inculpated through <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> or confession; he was not yet supposed guilty, though he was compelled to promise under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> always to be ready to come before the inquisitor, and in the end to accept with good grace his <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>, whatever its tenor. The <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was assuredly a terrible weapon in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> judge. If the accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> kept it, the judge was favourably inclined; on the other hand, if the accused violated it, his credit grew worse. Many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, it was known, repudiated <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> on principle; hence the violation of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the guilty party easily to incur suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, the inquisitor might secure himself by demanding a sum of money as bail, or reliable bondsmen who would stand surety for the accused. It happened, too, that bondsmen undertook upon <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to deliver the accused "dead or alive" It was perhaps unpleasant to live under the burden of such an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but, at any rate, it was more endurable than to await a final verdict in rigid confinement for months or longer.

<p>Curiously enough, torture was not regarded as a mode of punishment, but purely as a means of eliciting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It was not of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin, and was long prohibited in the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>. Nor was it originally an important factor in the inquisitional procedure, being unauthorized until twenty years after the Inquisition had begun. It was first authorized by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad exstirpanda" of 15 May, 1252, which was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> on 30 November, 1259, and by <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> on 3 November, 1265. The limit placed upon torture was <em>citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum</em> &#151; i.e, it was not to cause the loss of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> or limb or imperil <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. Torture was to applied <em>only once</em>, and not then unless the accused were uncertain in his statements, and seemed already virtually convicted by manifold and weighty <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. In general, this <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> testimony (<em>quaestio</em>) was to be deferred as long as possible, and recourse to it was permitted in only when all other expedients were exhausted. Conscientious and sensible judges quite properly attached no great importance to confessions extracted by torture. After long experience <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Eymeric</a> declared: <em>Quaestiones sunt fallaces et inefficaces</em> &#151; i.e the torture is deceptive and ineffectual.

<p>Had this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> legislation been adhered to in practice, the historian of the Inquisition would have fewer difficulties to satisfy. In the beginning, torture was held to be so odious that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were forbidden to be present under pain of <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. Sometimes it had to be interrupted so as to enable the inquisitor to continue his <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a>, which, of course, was attended by numerous inconveniences. Therefore on 27 April, 1260, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> authorized inquisitors to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> one another of this <a href="../cathen/08170a.htm">irregularity</a>. <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> on 2 August, 1262, renewed the permission, and this was soon interpreted as formal licence to continue the <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a> in the torture chamber itself. The inquisitors manuals faithfully noted and approved this usage. The general rule ran that torture was to be resorted to only once. But this was sometimes circumvented &#151; first, by assuming that with every new piece of evidence the rack could be utilized afresh, and secondly, by imposing fresh torments on the poor victim (often on different days), not by way of repetition, but as a continuation (non ad modum iterationis sed continuationis), as defended by <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Eymeric</a>; "quia, iterari non debent [tormenta], nisi novis supervenitibus indiciis, continuari non prohibentur." But what was to be done when the accused, released from the rack, denied what he had just confessed? Some held with <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Eymeric</a> that the accused should be set at liberty; others, however, like the author of the "Sacro Arsenale" held that the torture should be continued, because the accused had too seriously incriminated himself by his previous confession. When <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> formulated his regulations for the employment of torture, he never <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagined</a> that eventually even <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> would be put on the rack, although not their guilt, but that of the accused, was in question. From the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> silence it was concluded that a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> might be put upon the rack at the discretion of the inquisitor. Moreover, if the accused was convicted through <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, or had pleaded guilty, the torture might still he used to compel him to testify against his friends and fellow-culprits. It would be opposed to all Divine and human equity &#151; so one reads in the "Sacro Arsenale, ovvero Pratica dell Officio della Santa Inquisizione" (Bologna, 1665) &#151; to inflict torture unless the judge were personally persuaded of the guilt of the accused.

<p>But one of the difficulties of the procedure is why torture was used as a means of learning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. On the one hand, the torture was continued until the accused confessed or intimated that he was willing to confess. On the other hand, it was not desired, as in fact it was not possible, to regard as freely made a confession wrung by torture.

<p>It is at once apparent how little reliance may be placed upon the assertion so often repeated in the minutes of trials, "confessionem esse veram, non factam vi tormentorum" (the confession was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and free), even though one had not occasionally read in the preceding pages that, after being taken down from the rack (<em>postquam depositus fuit de tormento</em>), he freely confessed this or that. However, it is not of greater importance to say that torture is seldom mentioned in the records of inquisition trials &#151; but once, for example in 636 condemnations between 1309 and 1323; this does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that torture was rarely applied. Since torture was originally inflicted outside the court room by lay officials, and since only the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> confession was valid before the judges, there was no occasion to mention in the records the fact of torture. On the other hand it, is historically <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> not only always held that torture must not imperil <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> or but also tried to abolish particularly grievous abuses, when such became known to them. Thus <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> ordained that inquisitors should not apply the torture without the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From the middle of the thirteenth century, they did not disavow the principle itself, and, as their restrictions to its use were not always heeded, its severity, though of tell exaggerated, was in many cases extreme.

<p>The consuls of Carcassonne in 1286 complained to the <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">King of France</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicars</a> of the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> against the inquisitor Jean Garland, whom they charged with inflicting torture in an absolutely inhuman manner, and this charge was no isolated one. The case of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> has never been altogether cleared up in this respect. The official report says he had to suffer three and a half <em>tratti da fune</em> (a sort of strappado). When <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> showed discontent with the delays of the trial, the Florentine government excused itself by urging that <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> was a man of extraordinary sturdiness and endurance, and that he had been vigorously tortured on many days (<em>assidua quaestione multis diebus</em>, the <a href="../cathen/12503a.htm">papal prothonotary</a>, <a href="../cathen/03064a.htm">Burchard</a>, says seven times) but with little effect.

<p>It is to be noted that torture was most cruelly used, where the inquisitors were most exposed to the pressure of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, though always boasting of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the purity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, abused both rack and Inquisition to put out of the way his personal enemies. The tragical ruin of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> is ascribed to the abuse of torture by <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> and his henchmen. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for instance, thirty-six, and at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> twenty-five, <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> died as the result of torture. <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a> could not have been sent to the stake as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and a recalcitrant, if her judges had not been tools of English policy. And the excesses of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition are largely due to the fact that in its administration civil purposes overshadowed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. Every reader of the "Cautio criminalis" of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> <a href="../cathen/14213b.htm">Friedrich Spee</a> knows to whose account chiefly must be set down the horrors of the <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> trials.

<p>Most of the punishments that were properly speaking inquisitional were not inhuman, either by their nature or by the manner of their infliction. Most frequently certain good works were ordered, e.g. the building of a church, the visitation of a church, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> more or less distant, the <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a> or a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, participation in a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and the like. Other works partook more of the character of real and to some extent degrading punishments, e.g. fines, whose proceeds were devoted to such public purposes as church-building, road-making, and the like; whipping with rods during religious service; the pillory; the wearing of coloured crosses, and so on.

<p>The hardest penalties were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in its various degrees, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">exclusion from the communion of the Church</a>, and the usually consequent surrender to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. "Cum ecclesia" ran the regular expression, "ultra non habeat quod faciat pro suis demeritis contra ipsum, idcirco, eundum reliquimus brachio et iudicio saeculari" &#151; i.e. since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can no farther punish his misdeeds, she leaves him to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>.

<p>Naturally enough, punishment as a legal <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> is always a hard and painful thing, whether decreed by civil or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> justice. There is, however, always an essential distinction between civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> punishment. While chastisement inflicted by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> aims chiefly at punishment violation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seeks primarily the correction of the delinquent; indeed his spiritual welfare frequently so much in view that the element of punishment is almost entirely lost sight of. Commands to hear <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Holy Mass</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">holidays</a>, to frequent religious services, to abstain from manual labour, to receive Communion at the chief festivals of the year, to forbear from <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">soothsaying</a> and <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, etc., can be efficacious as helps toward the fulfillment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. It being furthermore incumbent on the inquisitor to consider not merely the external <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a>, but also the inner change of heart, his <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> lost the quasi-mechanical stiffness so often characteristic of civil condemnation. Moreover, the penalties incurred were on numberless occasions remitted, mitigated, or commuted. In the records of the Inquisition we very frequently read that because of old age, sickness, or poverty in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the due punishment was materially reduced owing to the inquisitor's sheer pity, or the petition of a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Imprisonment for life was altered to a fine, and this to an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; participation in a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was commuted into a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, while a distant and costly <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> became a visit to a neighboring shrine or church, and so on. If the inquisitor's leniency were abused, he was authorized to revive in full the original punishment.

<p>On the whole, the Inquisition was humanely conducted. Thus we read that a son obtained his father's release by merely asking for it, without putting forward any special reasons. Licence to leave risen for three weeks, three months, or an unlimited period &mdash; say until the recovery or decease of sick <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> &mdash; was not infrequent. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself censured inquisitioners or <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> them because they were too harsh, but never because they mere too merciful.

<p>Imprisonment was not always accounted punishment in the proper sense: it was rather looked on as an opportunity for <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a>, a preventive against backsliding or the infection of others. It was known as <em>immuration</em> (from the Latin <em>murus</em>, a wall), or incarceration, and was inflicted for a definite time or for life. Immuration for life was the lot of those who had failed to profit by the aforesaid term of grace, or had perhaps recanted only from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, or had once before <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>The <em>murus strictus seu arctus</em>, or <em>carcer strictissimus</em>, implied close and solitary confinement, occasionally aggravated by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or chains. In practice, however, these regulations were not always enforced literally. We read of immured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> receiving visits rather freely, playing games, or dining with their jailors. On the other hand, solitary confinement was at times deemed insufficient, and then the immured were put in irons or chained to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> wall. Members of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, when condemned for life, were immured in their own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, nor ever allowed to speak with any of their fraternity. The dungeon or cell was euphemistically called "In Pace"; it was, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a man buried alive. It was looked upon as a remarkable favour when, in 1330, through the good offices of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, the French king permitted a dignitary of a certain order to visit the "In Pace" twice a month and comfort his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> brethren, against which favour the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> lodged with <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> a fruitless protest. Though the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> cells were directed to be kept in such a way as to endanger neither the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> nor the health of occupants, their true condition was sometimes deplorable, as we see from a document published by J.B. Vidal (Annales de St-Louis des Francais, 1905 P. 362):<blockquote><p>In some cells the unfortunates were bound in stocks or chains, unable to move about, and forced to sleep on the ground . . . . There was little regard for cleanliness. In some cases there was no light or ventilation, and the food was meagre and very poor. </p></blockquote>Occasionally the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had to put an end through their <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to similarly atrocious conditions. After inspecting the Carcassonne and <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> in 1306, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> Pierre de la Chapelle and B&eacute;ranger de Fr&eacute;dol dismissed the warden, removed the chains from the captives, and rescued some from their underground dungeons. The local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was expected to provide food from the confiscated <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. For those doomed to close confinement, it was meagre enough, scarcely more than bread and water. It was, not long, however, before <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were allowed other victuals, wine and money also from outside, and this was soon generally tolerated.

<p>Officially it was not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentenced</a> unrepenting <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to death, more particularly to the stake. As <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> even <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a> never went further than the penal ordinances of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> required, nor ever inflicted a punishment more severe than <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Not until four years after the commencement of his pontificate did he admit the opinion, then prevalent among <a href="../cathen/09131d.htm">legists</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a>, seeing that it was confessedly no less serious an offence than high treason. Nevertheless he continued to insist on the exclusive <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to decide in authentic manner in matters of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; at the same time it was not her office to pronounce <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, thenceforth, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">expelled from her bosom</a> the impenitent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, whereupon the state took over the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of his temporal punishment.

<p><a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> was of the same opinion; in his Constitution of 1224 he says that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> convicted by an <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> shall, on imperial authority, suffer death by fire (auctoritate nostra ignis iudicio concremandos), and similarly in 1233 "praesentis nostrae legis edicto damnatos mortem pati decernimus." In this way <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> may be regarded as having had no share either directly or indirectly in the death of condemned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Not so the succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad exstirpanda" (1252) <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> says:

<blockquote><p>When those adjudged guilty of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> have been given up to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his representative, or the Inquisition, the podest&agrave; or chief magistrate of the city shall take them at once, and shall, within five days at the most, execute the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made against them. </p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, he directs that this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and the corresponding regulations of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> be entered in every city among the municipal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, which was also visited on those who failed to execute both the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and the imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a>. Nor could any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> remain as to what civil regulations were meant, for the passages which ordered the burning of impenitent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were inserted in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> from the imperial constitutions "Commissis nobis" and "Inconsutibilem tunicam". The aforesaid <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad exstirpanda" remained thenceforth a fundamental document of the Inquisition, renewed or reinforced by several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> (1254-61), <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> (1265-68), <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> (1288-02), <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (1294-1303), and others. The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, therefore, were enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to execute the legal sentences that condemned impenitent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the stake. It is to be noted that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> itself was no trifle, for, if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> did not free himself from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> within a year, he was held by the legislation of that period to be a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and incurred all the penalties that affected <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p><em>The Number of Victims.</em>

<p>How many victims were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> cannot be stated with even approximate accuracy. We have nevertheless some valuable information about a few of the Inquisition tribunals, and their statistics are not without interest. At <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a>, from 1318 to 1324, out of twenty-four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> convicted but five were delivered to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> from 1308 to 1323, only forty-two out of nine hundred and thirty bear the ominous note "relictus culiae saeculari". Thus, at <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a> one in thirteen, and at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> one in forty-two seem to have been burnt for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> although these places were hotbeds of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and therefore principal centres of the Inquisition. We may add, also, that this was the most active period of the institution.

<p>These data and others of the same nature bear out the assertion that the Inquisition marks a substantial advance in the contemporary administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and therefore in the general civilization of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. A more terrible <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> awaited the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> when judged by a secular court. In 1249 <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Count Raymund VII of Toulouse</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> eighty confessed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be burned in his presence without permitting them to recant. It is impossible to imagine any such trials before the Inquisition courts. The large numbers of burnings detailed in various histories are completely unauthenticated, and are either the deliberate invention of pamphleteers, or are based on materials that pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition of later times or the German <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> trials (Vacandard, op. cit., 237 sqq.).

<p>Once the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> touching the <em>crimen laesae majestatis</em> had been made to cover the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, it was only natural that the royal or imperial treasury should imitate the Roman <em>fiscus</em>, and lay claim to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> condemned. It was fortunate, though inconsistent and certainly not strict <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that this penalty did not affect every condemned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but only those <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentenced</a> to perpetual confinement or the stake. Even so, this circumstance added not a little to the penalty, especially as in this respect innocent people, the culprit's wife and children, were the chief sufferers. Confiscation was also decreed against <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> deceased, and there is a relatively high number of such judgments. Of the six hundred and thirty-six cases that came before the inquisitor Bernard Gui, eighty-eight pertained to dead people.

<p><em>(e) The Final Verdict</em>

<p>The ultimate decision was usually pronounced with solemn ceremonial at the <em>sermo generalis</em> &#151; or <em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em> (<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), as it was later called. One or two days prior to this <em>sermo</em> everyone concerned had the charges read to him again briefly, and in the vernacular; the evening before he was told where and when to appear to hear the verdict. The sermo, a short discourse or exhortation, began very early in the morning; then followed the swearing in of the secular officials, who were made to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> obedience to the inquisitor in all things pertaining to the suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Then regularly followed the so-called "decrees of mercy" (i.e. commutations, mitigations, and remission of previously imposed penalties), and finally due punishments were assigned to the guilty, after their offences had been again enumerated. This announcement began with the minor punishments, and went on to the most severe, i.e., perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> or death. Thereupon the guilty were turned over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, and with this act the <em>sermo generalis</em> closed, and the inquisitional proceedings were at an end.

<p>(3) The chief scene of the Inquisition's activity was Central and Southern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The Scandinavian countries were spared altogether. It appears in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> only on the occasion of the trial of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, nor was it known in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> until the accession of Ferdinand and <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella</a>. It was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> with the Spanish domination, while in Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it was relatively little known. On the other hand, the Inquisition, whether because of the particularly perilous sectarianism there prevalent or of the greater severity of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil rulers, weighed heavily on <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (especially <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>), on Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (in particular the country of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and on Languedoc) and finally on the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a> and on <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> (1285-87) introduced it into <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and in the fifteenth century it displayed excessive <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The inquisitors were, as a rule, irreproachable, not merely in personal conduct, but in the administration of their office. Some, however, like Robert le Bougre, a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> (Catharist) <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and subsequently a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, seem to have yielded to a blind fanaticism and deliberately to have provoked executions <em>en masse</em>. On 29 May, 1239, at Montwimer in Champagne, Robert consigned to the flames at one time about a hundred and eighty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whose trial had begun and ended within one week. Later, when <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> found that the complaints against him were justified, he was first <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> and then incarcerated for life.

<p>(4) How are we to explain the Inquisition in the light of its own period? For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> office of the historian is not to defend facts and conditions, but to study and understand them in their natural course and connection. It is indisputable that in the past scarcely any community or nation vouchsafed perfect <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a> to those who set up a <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> different from that of the generality. A kind of iron <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> would seem to dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to religious intolerance. Even long before the Roman State tried to check with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> the rapid encroachments of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had declared it one of the supreme <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the governmental authority in his ideal state to show no <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a> towards the "godless" &#151; that is, towards those who denied the state religion &#151; even though they were content to live quietly and without proselytizing; their very example, he said would be dangerous. They were to be kept in custody; "in a place where one grew wise" (<em>sophronisterion</em>), as the place of incarceration was euphemistically called; they should be relegated thither for five years, and during this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> listen to religious instruction every day. The more active and proselytizing opponents of the state religion were to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for life in dreadful dungeons, and after death to be deprived of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a>. It is thus evident what little <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> there is for regarding intolerance as a product of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Everywhere and always in the past men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that nothing disturbed the common weal and public peace so much as religious dissensions and conflicts, and that, on the other hand, a uniform public <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was the surest guarantee for the State's stability and prosperity. The more thoroughly religion had become part of the national life, and the stronger the general conviction of its inviolability and Divine origin, the more disposed would men be to consider every attack on it as an intolerable crime against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Deity</a> and a highly criminal menace to the public peace. The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that one of the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of an imperial ruler was to place his sword at the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, especially as their titles of "Pontifex Maximus" and "Bishop of the Exterior" seemed to argue in them Divinely appointed agents of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.

<p>Nevertheless the principal teachers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> held back for centuries from accepting in these matters the practice of the civil rulers; they shrank particularly from such stern measures against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as punishment, both of which they deemed inconsistent with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> became alone dominant, and the welfare of the Commonwealth came to be closely bound up with the cause of religious unity.

<p>King Peter of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, therefore, but voiced the universal conviction when he said: "The enemies of the Cross of Christ and violators of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are likewise our enemies and the enemies of our kingdom, and ought therefore to be dealt with as such." <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> emphasized this view more vigorously than any other prince, and enforced it in his Draconian enactments against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p>The representative of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were also children of their own time, and in their conflict with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> accepted the help that their age freely offered them, and indeed often forced upon them. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> and canonists, the highest and the saintliest, stood by the code of their day, and sought to explain and to justify it. The learned and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a>, highly esteemed by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, was content with the penalties that dated from <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, viz., the ban of the empire, confiscation of property, confinement in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, etc. But before the end of the century, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (Summa Theol., <a href="../summa/3011.htm#article3">II-II:11:3</a> and <a href="../summa/3011.htm#article4">II-II:11:4</a>) already advocated <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">capital punishment</a> for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> though it cannot be said that his arguments altogether compel conviction. The <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>, however speaks only in a general way of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punishment by death</a>, and does not specify more nearly the manner of its infliction.

<p>This the jurists did in a positive way that was truly terrible. The celebrated <a href="../cathen/07238a.htm">Henry of Segusia (Susa)</a>, named Hostiensis after his episcopal See of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (d. 1271), and the no less eminent Joannes Andreae (d. 1345), when interpreting the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Ad abolendam" of <a href="../cathen/09412b.htm">Lucius III</a>, take <em>debita animadversio</em> (due punishment) as synonymous with <em>ignis crematio</em> (death by fire), a meaning which certainly did not attach to the original expression of 1184. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> and jurists based their attitude to some extent on the similarity between <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and high treason (<em>crimen laesae maiestatis</em>), a suggestion that they owed to the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Law of Ancient Rome</a>. They argued, moreover, that if the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> could be rightly inflicted on thieves and <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgers</a>, who rob us only of worldly goods, how much more righteously on those who cheat us out of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> goods &#151; out of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the life of the soul. In the severe legislation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#vrs6">Deuteronomy 13:6-9</a>; <a href="../bible/deu017.htm#vrs1">17:1-6</a>) they found another argument. And lest some should urge that those ordinances were abrogated by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were recalled: "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs17">Matthew 5:17</a>); also His other saying (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs6">John 15:6</a>): "If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth" (<em>in ignem mittent, et ardet</em>).

<p>It is well known that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of punishing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> with death was so common among the sixteenth century reformers &#151; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, and their adherents &#151; that we may say their <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a> began where their power ended. The Reformed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, Hieronymus Zanchi, declared in a lecture delivered at the University of Heidleberg:<blockquote><p>We do not now ask if the authorities <em>may</em> pronounce <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> upon <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; of that there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and all learned and right-minded <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> acknowledge it. The only question is whether the authorities <em>are bound</em> to perform this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>.</p></blockquote>And Zanchi answers this second question in the affirmative, especially on the authority of "all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned men who have written on the subject in our day" [Historisch-politische Blatter, CXL, (1907), p. 364]. It may be that in modern times men judge more leniency the views of others, but does this forthwith make their opinions objectively more correct than those of their predecessors? Is there no longer any inclination to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>? As late as 1871 Professor Friedberg wrote in Holtzendorff's "Jahrbuch fur Gesetzebung": "If a new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious society</a> were to be established today with such principles as those which, according to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> declares a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we would undoubtedly consider it a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the state to suppress, destroy, and uproot it by force" (K&ouml;lnische Volkszeitung, no. 782, 15 Sept., 1909). Do these sentiments indicate an ability to appraise justly the institutions and opinions of former centuries, not according to modern feelings, but to the standards of their age?

<p>In forming an estimate of the Inquisition, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish clearly between principles and historical fact on the one hand, and on the other those exaggerations or rhetorical descriptions which reveal bias and an obvious determination to injure <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, rather than to encourage the spirit of <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">tolerance</a> and further its exercise. It is also essential to note that the Inquisition, in its establishment and procedure, pertained not to the sphere of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but to that of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is in no way affected by the question as to whether the Inquisition was justified in its scope, or wise in its methods, or extreme in its practice. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> established by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, is empowered to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and inflict penalties for their violation. <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">Heresy</a> not only violates her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> but strikes at her very life, <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">unity of belief</a>; and from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> had incurred all the penalties of the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>. When <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became the religion of the Empire, and still more when the peoples of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations, the close alliance of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> made <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">unity of faith</a> essential not only to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, but also to civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">Heresy</a>, in consequence, was a crime which secular rulers were bound in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to punish. It was regarded as worse than any other crime, even that of high treason; it was for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in those times what we call <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. Hence the severity with which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were treated by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> long before the Inquisition was established.

<p>As regards the character of these punishments, it should be considered that they were the natural expression not only of the legislative power, but also of the popular <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in an age that dealt both vigorously and roughly with criminals of every type. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, in a word, was simply an outlaw whose offence, in the popular mind, deserved and sometimes received a punishment as summary as that which is often dealt out in our own day by an infuriated populace to the authors of justly detested crimes. That such intolerance was not peculiar to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, but was the natural accompaniment of deep religious conviction in those, also, who abandoned the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is evident from the measures taken by some of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> against those who differed from them in matters of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. As the learned Dr. Schaff declares in his "History of the Christian Church" (vol. V, New York, 1907, p. 524),<blockquote><p>To the great humiliation of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches, religious intolerance and even <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> unto death were continued long after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In Geneva the pernicious theory was put into practice by <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">state and church</a>, even to the use of torture and the admission of the testimony of children against their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and with the sanction of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. Bullinger, in the second Helvetic Confession, announced the principle that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> could be punished like <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">treason</a>.</p></blockquote>Moreover, the whole history of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the spirit of intolerance prevalent in many of the American colonies during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may be cited in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> thereof. It would obviously be absurd to make the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a> as such responsible for these practices. But having set up the principle of private judgment, which, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> applied, made <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> impossible, the early <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> proceeded to treat dissidents as the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had been treated. To suggest that this was inconsistent is trivial in view of the deeper insight it affords into the meaning of a <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">tolerance</a> which is often only theoretical and the source of that intolerance which men rightly show towards <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and which they naturally though not rightly, transfer to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a>.

<h3 id="IIB">The inquisition in Spain</h3>

<h4 id="i">Historical facts</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">Religious</a> conditions similar to those in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> occasioned the establishment of the Inquisition in the neighboring <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a>. As early as 1226 King James I had forbidden the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Catharists</a> his kingdom, and in 1228 had outlawed both them and their friends. A little later, on the advice of his confessor, <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a>, he asked <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to establish the Inquisition in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Declinante jam mundi" of 26 May, 1232, Archbishop Esparrago and his suffragans were instructed to search, either personally or by enlisting the services of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> or other suitable agents, and condignly punish the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a> in 1237 the Inquisition was formally confided to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> in 1242, <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a> defined the terms <em>haereticus, receptor, fautor, defensor</em>, etc., and outlined the penalties to be inflicted. Although the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> were also adopted and executed with strictness by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, no striking success resulted. The Inquisitor Fray Pence de Planes was poisoned, and Bernardo Travasser earned the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon's</a> best-known inquisitor is the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Nicolas Eymeric</a> (Qu&eacute;tif-Echard, "Scriptores Ord. Pr.", I, 709 sqq.). His "Directorium Inquisitionis" (written in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> 1376; printed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 1587, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> 1595 and 1607), based on forty-four years experience, is an original source and a document of the highest historical value.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition, however, properly begins with the reign of Ferdinand the Catholic and <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was then endangered by pseudo-converts from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> (Marranos) and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> (Moriscos). On 1 November, 1478, <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> empowered the Catholic sovereigns to set up the Inquisition. The judges were to be at least forty years old, of unimpeachable <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, distinguished for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and wisdom, masters of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> or licentiates of canon law, and they must follow the usual <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rules and regulations. On 17 September, 1480, Their Catholic Majesties appointed, at first for Seville, the two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> Miguel de Morillo and Juan de San Martin as inquisitors, with two of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> assistants.

<p>Before long complaints of grievous abuses reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and were only too well founded. In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> of 29 January 1482, they were blamed for having, upon the alleged authority of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Briefs</a>, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> many people, subjected them to cruel tortures, declared them <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> believers, and sequestrated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the executed. They were at first admonished to act only in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and finally were threatened with <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a>, and would indeed have been <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> had not Their Majesties interceded for them.

<p><a href="../cathen/14783a.htm">Fray Tom&aacute;s Torquemada</a> (b. at Valladolid in 1420, d. at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, 16 September, 1498) was the true organizer of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition. At the solicitation of their Spanish Majesties (Paramo, II, tit. ii, c, iii, n. 9) <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> bestowed on <a href="../cathen/14783a.htm">Torquemada</a> the office of grand inquisitor, the institution of which indicates a decided advance in the development of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition. <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> approved the act of his predecessor, and under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 11 February, 1486, and 6 February, 1487, <a href="../cathen/14783a.htm">Torquemada</a> was given dignity of grand inquisitor for the kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, etc. The institution speedily ramified from Seville to <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, <a href="../cathen/08267a.htm">Ja&eacute;n</a>, Villareal, and Toledo, About 1538 there were nineteen courts, to which three were afterwards added in Spanish America (<a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Mexico</a>, <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>). Attempts at introducing it into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> failed, and the efforts to establish it in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> entailed disastrous consequences for the mother country. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, however, it remained operative into the nineteenth century. Originally called into being against secret <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and secret <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, it served to repel <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the sixteenth century, but was unable to expel <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">immorality</a> of the eighteenth. King Joseph Bonaparte abrogated it in 1808, but it was reintroduced by Ferdinand VII in 1814 and approved by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> on certain <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, among others the abolition of torture. It was definitely abolished by the Revolution of 1820.

<h4 id="ii">Organization</h4>

<p>At the head of the Inquisition, known as the Holy Office, stood the grand inquisitor, <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> by the king and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. By virtue of his <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> credentials he enjoyed authority to <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegate</a> his powers to other suitable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and to receive <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> from all Spanish courts. He was aided by a High Council (<em>Consejo Supremo</em>) consisting of five members &#151; the so-called Apostolic inquisitors, two secretaries, two relatores, one advocatus fiscalis &#151; and several consulters and qualificators. The officials of the supreme tribunal were appointed by the grand inquisitor after consultation with the king. The former could also freely appoint, transfer, remove from office, visit, and inspect or call to account all inquisitors and officials of the lower courts. Philip III, on 16 December, 1618, gave the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of having one of their order permanently a member of the Consejo Supremo. All power was really concentrated in this supreme tribunal. It decided important or disputed questions, and heard <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a>; without its approval no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, or noble could be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and no <em>auto-da-f&eacute;</em> held; an annual report was made to it concerning the entire Inquisition, and once a month a financial report. Everyone was subject to it, not excepting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or even the sovereign. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition is distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> its monarchical constitution and a greater consequent centralization, as also by the constant and legally provided-for influence of the crown on all official appointments and the progress of trials.

<h4 id="iii">Procedure</h4>

<p>The procedure, on the other hand, was substantially the same as that already described. Here, too, a "term of grace" of thirty to forty days was invariably granted, and was often prolonged. Imprisonment resulted only when unanimity had been arrived at, or the offence had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">Examination</a> of the accused could take place only in the presence of two disinterested <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> it was to restrain any arbitrary act in their presence the <a href="../cathen/12503b.htm">protocol</a> had to be read out twice to the accused. The defence lay always in the hands of a lawyer. The <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, although unknown to the accused, were sworn, and very severe punishment, even death, awaited <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, (cf. <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> of 14 December, 1518). Torture was applied only too frequently and too cruelly, but certainly not more cruelly than under <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V's</a> system of judicial torture in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<h4 id="iv">Historical analysis</h4>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition deserves neither the exaggerated praise nor the equally exaggerated vilification often bestowed on it. The number of victims cannot be calculated with even approximate accuracy; the much maligned <em>autos-da-f&eacute;</em> were in reality but a religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> (<em>actus fidei</em>); the <em>San Benito</em> has its counterpart in similar garbs elsewhere; the cruelty of <a href="../cathen/11772b.htm">St. Peter Arbues</a>, to whom not a single <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> can be traced with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, belongs to the realms of fable. However, the predominant <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nature of the institution can hardly be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanctioned</a> the institution, accorded to the grand inquisitor <a href="../cathen/08050a.htm">canonical installation</a> and therewith judicial authority concerning matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while from the grand inquisitor <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> passed down to the subsidiary tribunals under his control. <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">Joseph de Maistre</a> introduced the thesis that the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Inquisition was mostly a civil tribunal; formerly, however, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> never questioned its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nature. Only thus, indeed, can one explain how the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Popes</a> always admitted <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> from it to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, called to themselves entire trials and that at any stage of the proceedings, exempted whole classes of believers from its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, intervened in the legislation, <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> grand inquisitors, and so on. (See <a href="../cathen/14783a.htm">TOM&Aacute;S DE TORQUEMADA</a>.)

<h3 id="IIC">The Holy Office at Rome</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">great apostasy of the sixteenth century</a>, the filtration of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lands, and the progress of heterodox teachings everywhere, prompted <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to establish the "Sacra Congregatio Romanae et universalis Inquisitionis seu sancti officii" by the Constitution "Licet ab initio" of 21 July, 1542. This inquisitional tribunal, composed of six <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, was to be at once the final court of appeal for trials concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the court of first instance for cases <a href="../cathen/12784a.htm">reserved</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> &#151; especially <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (by the Constitutions "Pastoralis Oficii" of 14 October, 1562, "Romanus Pontifex" of 7 April, 1563, "Cum nos per" of 1564, "Cum inter crimina" of 27 August, 1562) and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 1566, the Constitution "Inter multiplices" of 21 December, 1566, and "Cum felicis record." of 1566) &#151; made further provision for the procedure and competency of this court. By his Constitution "Immensa aeterni" of 23 January, 1587, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> became the real organizer, or rather reorganizer of this congregation.

<p>The Holy Office is first among the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>. Its personnel includes judges, officials, consultors, and qualificators. The real judges are <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose original number of six was raised by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> to eight and by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> to thirteen. Their actual number depends on the reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, Constitution "Sollicita et Provida", 1733). This <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">congregation</a> differs from the others, inasmuch as it has no cardinal-prefect: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> always presides in person when momentous decisions are to be announced (<em>coram Sanctissimo</em>). The solemn plenary session on Thursdays is always preceded by a session of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on Wednesdays, at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and a meeting of the consultors on Mondays at the palace of the Holy Office. The highest official is the <em>commissarius sancti oficii</em>, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombard</a> province, to whom two coadjutors are given from the same order. He acts as the proper judge throughout the whole case until the plenary session exclusive, thus conducting it up to the verdict. The <em>assessor sancti officii</em>, always one of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, presides at the plenary sessions. The <em>promotor fiscalis</em> is at once prosecutor and fiscal representative, while the <em>advocatus reorum</em> undertakes the defence of the accused. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the consultors is to afford the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> expert advice. They may come from the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> or the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, but the General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the <em><a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">magister sacri palatii</a></em>, and a third member of the same order are always ex-officio consultors (<em>consultores nati</em>). The qualificators are appointed for life, but give their opinions only when called upon. The Holy Office has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and, according to <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, even over <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. In practice, however, the latter are held <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">exempt</a>. For its authority, see the aforesaid Constitution of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> "Immensa aeterni" (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">ROMAN CONGREGATIONS</a>).
