<h1>Inscription of Abercius</h1>  

<p>A Greek <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiographical</a> text, which has, however, undergone alterations, and a Greek <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a> of the second century have made known to us a certain Abercius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hieropolis, in Phrygia, who, about the middle of the century in question, left his episcopal city and visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On his way home he travelled through <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/10210b.htm">Mesopotamia</a>, and was received with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> in various places. He died shortly after his return to Hieropolis, but not before he had composed his own epitaph, conveying a most vivid impression of all he had admired during his stay in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This epitaph may well have inspired the <em>Life</em> of Abercius such as it has come down to us, since all its details may be explained by the hints contained in the inscription, or else belong to the common foundation of all legends of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The <em>Life</em>, as a matter of fact, includes a transcription of the epitaph. <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> was greatly struck by the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> therein expressed, and <a href="../cathen/12119b.htm">Pitra</a> endeavoured to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> its <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> and its important bearing on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbolism. Renan regarded both the <em>Life</em> and inscription as fanciful compositions, but in 1882 an English traveller, W. Ramsay, discovered at Kelendres, near <a href="../cathen/14387a.htm">Synnada</a>, in Phrygia Salutaris (<a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>), a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <em>stele</em> (inscribed slab) bearing the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the year 300 of the Phrygian era (A.D. 216). The inscription in question recalled the memory of a certain Alexander, son of Anthony. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and Duchesne at once recognized in it phrases similar to those in the epitaph of Abercius. On comparison it was found that the inscription in memory of Alexander corresponded, almost word for word, with the first and last verses of the epitaph of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hieropolis; all the middle part was missing. Mr. Ramsay, on a second visit to the site of Hieropolis, in 1883, discovered two new fragments covered with inscriptions, built into the masonry of the public baths. These fragments, which are now in the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="../cathen/10647a.htm">Christian Museum</a>, filled out the middle part of the <em>stele</em> inscribed with the epitaph of Abercius. It now became possible, with the help of the text preserved in the <em>Life</em>, to restore the original text of the epitaph with practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Certain <em>lacunae</em>, letters effaced or cut off by breaks in the stone, have been the subject of profound discussions, resulting in a text which may henceforth be looked on as settled, and which it may be useful to give here. The capital letters at the beginning and end of the inscription represent the parts found on the inscription of Alexander, the son of Anthony, those of the middle part are the remaining fragments of the epitaph of Abercius, while the small letters give the reading according to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <em>Life</em>: 

<blockquote><p>"The citizen of a chosen city, this [monument] I made [while] living, that there I might have in time a resting-place of my body, [I] being by name Abercius, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> shepherd who feeds flocks of sheep [both] on mountains and on plains, who has great eyes that see everywhere. For this [shepherd] taught me [that the] book [of life] is worthy of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. And to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he sent me to contemplate majesty, and to see a queen golden-robed and golden-sandalled; there also I saw a people bearing a shining mark. And I saw the land of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and all [its] cities Nisibis [I saw] when I passed over Euphrates. But everywhere I had brethren. I had Paul. . . . <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> drew with her hands from a fountain and this it [<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>] ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread. These things I, Abercius, having been a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> [of them] told to be written here. Verily I was passing through my seventy-second year. He that discerneth these things, every fellow-believer [namely], let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Abercius. And no one shall put another grave over my grave; but if he do, then shall he pay to the treasury of [the] Romans two thousand pieces of gold and to my good native city of Hieropolis one thousand pieces of gold." </p></blockquote>

<p>The interpretation of this inscription has stimulated ingenious efforts and very animated controversies. In 1894 <a href="../cathen/06068a.htm">G. Ficker</a>, supported by O. Hirschfeld, strove to prove that Abercius was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Cybele. In 1895 A. Harnack offered an explanation which was sufficiently obscure, making Abercius the representative of an ill-defined religious <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> arbitrarily combined in such a fashion as to explain all portions of the inscription which were otherwise inexplicable. In 1896, Dieterich made Abercius a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Attis. These plausible theories have been refuted by several learned <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">archaeologists</a>, especially by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Duchesne, and Cumont. Nor is there any further need to enter into the questions raised in one quarter or another; the following conclusions are indisputably historical. The epitaph of Abercius is generally, and with good reason, regarded as older than that of Alexander, the son of Anthony, i.e. prior to the year of Our Lord 216. The subject of it may be identified with a writer named Abercius Marcellus, author of a work against the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, some fragments of which have been preserved by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. As the treatise in question was written about the year 193, the epitaph may be assigned to the last years of the second, or to the beginning of the third, century. The writer was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a little town, the name of which is wrongly given in the <em>Life</em>, since he belongs to Hieropolis in Phrygia Salutaris, and not to Hierapolis in Phrygia Pacatiensis. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this fact given by Duchesne is all that could be wished for. The text of the inscription itself is of the greatest possible importance in connection with the symbolism of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The poem of sixteen verses which forms the epitaph shows plainly that the language used is one not understood by all; Let the brother who shall understand this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Abercius. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is merely mentioned, but on his way home he gives us the principal stages of his itinerary. He passed along the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> coast and, possibly, came to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, thence to <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, after having traversed the whole of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, while his return to Hieropolis may have been by way of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. The allusion to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul the Apostle</a>, which a gap in the text renders indecipherable, may originally have told how the traveller followed on his way back to his country the stages of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's third missionary</a> journey, namely: Issus, <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch in Pisidia</a>, and Apamea Cibotus, which would bring him into the heart of Phrygia. The inscription bears witness of no slight value to the importance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the second century. A mere glance at the text allows us to note: (1) The evidence of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which marks the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people with its dazzling seal; (2) The spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, whose members Abercius meets with everywhere; (3) The receiving of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and of Mary, in the Eucharist, (4) under the <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <a href="../cathen/02749a.htm">Bread</a> and Wine. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cultus of Abercius presents no point of special interest; his name appears for the first time in the Greek <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menologies</a> and synaxaries of the tenth century, but is not found in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">Martyrology</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>.
