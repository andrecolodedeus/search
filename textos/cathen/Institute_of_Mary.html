<h1>Institute of Mary</h1>  

<p>The official title of the second congregation founded by <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a>. Under this title Barbara Babthorpe, the fourth successor <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a> as "chief superior", petitioned for and obtained the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of its rule in 1703. It is the title appended to the signatures of the first chief superiors, and mentioned in the "formula of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>" of the first members. "Englische Fr&auml;ulein", "Dame Inglesse", "Loretto Nuns", are popular names for the members of the institute in the various countries where they have established themselves. On the suppression, in 1630, of <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward's</a> first congregation, styled by its opponents the "Jesuitesses", the greater number of the members returned to the world or entered other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. A certain number, however, who desired still to live in religion under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a>, were sheltered with the permission of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> in the Paradeiser Haus, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, by the Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Maximilian I. Thence some of the younger members were transferred at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there to live with <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a> and be trained by her in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Her work, therefore, was not destroyed, but reconstituted with certain modifications of detail, such as subjection to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary instead of to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> immediately, as in the original scheme. It was fostered by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban</a> and his successors, who as late as the end of the seventeenth century granted a monthly subsidy to the Roman house. <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a> died in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at Heworth near York in 1645, and was succeeded as chief superior by Barbara Babthorpe, who resided at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as head of the "English Ladies", and on her death was buried there in the church of the English College. She was succeeded as head of the institute by Mary Pointz, the first companion of <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a>. The community at Heworth removed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1650. In 1669 <a href="../cathen/02386c.htm">Frances Bedingfield</a>, one of the constant companions of <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a>, was sent by Mary Pointz to found a house in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Favoured by Catherine of Braganza, she established her community first in St. Martin's Lane, London, and afterwards at Hammersmith. Thence a colony moved to Heworth, and finally in 1686 to the site of the present <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, Micklegate Bar, York. In addition to that at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, two foundations had meantime been made in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>--at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1662, at Burghausen in 1683.

<p>At the opening of the eighteenth century the six houses of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Burghausen, Hammersmith, and York were governed by local superiors appointed by the chief superior, who resided for the most part at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had a vicaress in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Thus, for seventy years the institute carried on its work, not tolerated only, but protected by the various ordinaries, yet without official recognition till the year 1703, when at the petition of the Elector Maximilian Emanuel of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Mary of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, the exiled Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and others, its rule was approved by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a>. It was not in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> at that time to approve any institute of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was willing, however, to approve the institute <em>as such</em>, if the members would accept enclosure. But fidelity to their traditions, and experience of the benefit arising from non-enclosure in their special vocation, induced them to forego this further confirmation. The houses in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were given up about the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the confirmation of the rule in 1703. St. P&ouml;lten (1706) was the first foundation from <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> after the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>. In 1742 the houses in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and its dependencies were by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> made a separate province of the institute, and placed under a separate superior-general. The Austrian branch at present (1909) consists of fourteen houses. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a> and <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> have each two dependent filials. When the armies of the first <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> overran <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1809, the mother-house in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and the other houses of the institute in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>--Augsburg, Burghausen, and Alt&ouml;tting excepted--were broken up and the communities scattered. On the restoration of peace to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, King Louis I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> obtained <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and established them at Nymphenburg, where a portion of the royal palace was made over to them. In 1840 Madame Catherine de Graccho, the superior of this house, was appointed by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> general superior of the whole <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> institute. At the present day there are 85 houses under <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, with 1153 members, 90 Postulants, 1225 boarders, 11,447 day pupils and 1472 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Four houses in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and two in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are subject to Nymphenburg. The house in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> escaped secularization, being spared by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> on the condition that all connection with <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> should cease. It is now the mother-house of a branch which has eight filial <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">houses</a>.

<p>When vigour was reviving in the institute abroad, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> branch was founded (1821) at Rathfarnham, near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, by <a href="../cathen/02222b.htm">Frances Ball</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> lady, who had made her <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at York. There are now 19 houses of the institute in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 13 subject to Rathfarnham and 6 under their respective <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The dependencies of Rathfarnham are in all parts of the world--3 houses in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 2 in Mauritius, 2 at <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>, 10 in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 2 in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, 10 in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, with a Central Training College for teachers at <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a> (1906). There are 8 houses of the institute in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 3 in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 7 in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, about 180 houses in all. Owing to the variety of names and the independence of branches and houses, the essential unity of the institute is not readily recognized. The "English Virgins", or "English Ladies", is the title under which the members are known in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, whilst in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and where foundations from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> have been made, the name best known is "Loretto Nuns", from the name of the famous Italian shrine given to the mother-house at Rathfarnham. Each branch has its own <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and several have their special constitutions approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The "Institute of Mary" is the official title of all; all follow the rule approved for them by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, and share in the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of their institute given by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in 1877.

<p>The sisters devote themselves principally to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls in boarding-schools and academies, but they are also active in primary and secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in the training of teachers, instruction in the trades and domestic economy, and the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Several members of the institute have also become known as writers.
