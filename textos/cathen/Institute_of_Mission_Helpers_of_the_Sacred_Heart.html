<h1>Institute of Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart</h1>  

<p>In the autumn of 1888, there came to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, a convert, Mrs. Hartwell, who previous to her reception into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been interested in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. Under the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of Father Slattery, <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of St. Joseph's Society for the coloured missions she began to catechize the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> children, and was soon joined by some companions. In the autumn of 1890, these ladies wishing to become religious laid the foundations of a community under the name of "Mission Helpers, Daughters of the Holy Ghost". The work was missionary and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a>, but was exclusively for the coloured race, the sisters binding themselves thereto by a special <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Very soon an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls was opened. In 1895, the name of the institute was changed to "Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart" and the members were dispensed from the "negro" <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Thus there was no longer any distinction made as to race in the work of the sisters, which from that time was to embrace all the neglected poor. Hence, the field of missionary and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> labour was greatly broadened. A direct result of this change was the opening in 1897 of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf-mutes, at the request of Cardinal Gibbons. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institution for deaf-mutes in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. In Porto Rico, also, there was no provision whatsoever for deaf-mutes who were poor, until the Mission Helpers opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there, shortly after making their foundation in San Juan in 1902. This was a heavy undertaking, as the demands on the sisters for missionary and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> work in Porto Rico were very great, and the need urgent.

<p>At the first general chapter of the institute, which was held on 5 November, 1906, by command of Cardinal Gibbons, a constitution was adopted, and a superior general and her assistants elected according to its prescriptions. At this first election Mother M. Demetrias was chosen as mother general. The community was then officially declared canonically organized. Two important matters were settled about that time by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. The sisters were released from the observance of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which they had made to offer their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> for the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, it having been declared uncanonical. Perpetual adoration was also discontinued because of the bodily hardship it entailed. On account of their missionary labours the sisters were unable to keep up the work of adoration, without grave detriment to their health, consequently it was decided to restrict it to the First Fridays. The active work of the institute as outlined by the constitution embraces the keeping of industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for coloured girls; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for deaf-mutes; day-nurseries; teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and giving instruction wherever needed; visiting the poor in their own homes, and in institutions, such as <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and alms-houses, and preparing the dying for the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. There are houses of the institute in New York, <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a>, <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>.
