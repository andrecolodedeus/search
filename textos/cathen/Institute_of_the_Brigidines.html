<h1>Institute of the Brigidines</h1>  

<p>(SISTERS OF ST. BRIGID.)

<p>The Institute of the Brigidines was established by Most Rev. Dr. Delaney, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08637a.htm">Kildare and Leighlin</a>, at Tullow, Co. Carlow, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1807. Bishop Delaney, keenly alive to the lamentable state to which religion had been reduced by the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> and by the disastrous effects of the Rebellion of 1798, began to remedy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by applying himself to secure the proper observance of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>, and the religious instruction of the children and adult <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and diocese. He resided at Tullow, and to inaugurate his work there he formed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and reading classes to be held in the church on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. To carry out this purpose he selected a number of exemplary young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to form a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community. He allowed them to make <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and thus laid the foundation of the Brigidine Institute, one of the first of the kind founded in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>The sisters immediately opened <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the poorer and higher classes of children in the neighbourhood. This work proving successful, a building was erected for the accommodation of boarders who presented themselves, but who had until then to lodge in the town. Soon many came to avail themselves of the advantages of religious and secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> afforded by the Brigidine Sisters. The institute, although several times sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, continued a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregation until 1892, when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, on being solicited to place all the houses of the institute under a mother-general, issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> approving of change in government for five years by way of experiment, and in 1907 <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> confirmed, in perpetuity, the constitution of the new regime. Before and since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> several foundations have been made in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> and New Zealand, where there are at present fourteen houses of the institute. There are five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>: at Tullow, Mountrath, Abbeyleix, Goresbridge, and Ballyroan, all in the <a href="../cathen/08637a.htm">Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin</a>.

<p>The pupils of the Brigidines (boarding and benefit <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>) are prepared for the Intermediate, University, Senior Oxford, and Kensington Examinations, for those of the Incorporated Society of Music, and the technical courses.
