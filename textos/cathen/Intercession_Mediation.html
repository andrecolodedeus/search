<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Intercession (Mediation)</h1>  

<p>To intercede is to go or come between two parties, to plead before one of them on behalf of the other. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> it is used as the equivalent of <em>entygchanein</em> (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <em>interpellare</em>, in <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs25">Hebrews 7:25</a>). "Mediation" means a standing in the midst between two (contending) parties, for the purpose of bringing them together (cf. <em>mediator</em>, <em>mesites</em>, <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage both words are taken in the sense of the intervention primarily of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and secondarily of the Blessed Virgin and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, on behalf of men. It would be better, however, to restrict the word <em>mediation</em> to the action of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <em>intercession</em> to the action of the Blessed Virgin, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In this article we shall briefly deal with: I. the Mediation of Christ; and at more length with, II. the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The mediation of Christ</h2>

<p>In considering the Mediation of Christ we must distinguish between His position and His office. As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-man He stands in the midst between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man partaking of the natures of both, and therefore, by that very fact, fitted to act as Mediator between them. He is, indeed, the Mediator in the absolute sense of the word, in a way that no one else can possibly be. "For there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). He is united to both: "The head of every man is Christ... the head of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>). His office of Mediator belongs to Him as man, His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the <em>principium quo</em>, but the value of His action is derived from the fact that it is a Divine Person Who acts. The main object of His mediation is to restore the friendship between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. This is attained first by the meriting of grace and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by means of the worship and satisfaction offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by and through Christ. But, besides bringing man nigh unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Christ brings <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nigh unto man, by revealing to man Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and commands &mdash; He is the Apostle sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to us and the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a> leading us on to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/heb003.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 3:1</a>). Even in the physical order the mere fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> existence is in itself a mediation between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. By uniting our humanity to His Divinity He united us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to us. As <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> says, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> became man that men might become gods" (<a href="../fathers/2802.htm"><em>On the Incarnation</em> 54</a>; cf. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "Serm. De Nativitate Dom."; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/4001.htm#article2">III.1.2</a>). And for this Christ <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>: "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee. . . . I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one" (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs21">John 17:21-23</a>). The subject of <a href="../cathen/10118a.htm">Christ's mediation</a> belongs properly to the articles <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">ATONEMENT</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">JESUS CHRIST</a>; <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">REDEMPTION</a>. See also St. Thomas, <a href="../summa/4026.htm">III.26</a>; and the treatises on the Incarnation.
<h2 id="section2">Intercession and invocation</h2>

<p>We shall here speak not only of intercession, but also of the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The one indeed implies the other; we should not call upon the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> for aid unless they could help us. The foundation of both lies in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>. In the article on this subject it has been shown that the faithful in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on earth, and in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> are one mystical body, with Christ for their head. All that is of interest to one part is of interest to the rest, and each helps the rest: we on earth by honouring and invoking the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by interceding for us. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of intercession and invocation is set forth by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which teaches that <blockquote> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who reign together with Christ offer up their own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for men. It is good and useful suppliantly to invoke them, and to have recourse to their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, aid, and help for obtaining benefits from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, Who alone is our Redeemer and Saviour. Those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> think impiously who deny that the Saints, who enjoy eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, are to be invoked; or who assert either that they do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for men, or that the invocation of them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for each of us is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, or that it is repugnant to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the one Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (Sess. XXV). </blockquote>

<p>This had already been explained by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>: <blockquote> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is offered to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in two ways: one as though to be granted by himself, another as to be obtained through him. In the first way we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, because all our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> ought to be directed to obtaining grace and glory which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone gives, according to those words of the Psalm (lxxxiii, 12): 'The Lord will give grace and glory.' But in the second way we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">holy angels</a> and to men not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may learn our petition through them, but that by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and merits our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> may be efficacious. Wherefore it is said in the Apocalypse (viii, 4): 'And the smoke of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ascended up before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>' (Summ. Theol., II-II, Q. lxxxiii, a. 4). </blockquote>



<p>The reasonableness of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and practice cannot be better stated than in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> words: <blockquote> If the Apostles and Martyrs, while still in the body, can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, at a time when they must still be anxious for themselves, how much more after their crowns, victories, and triumphs are won! One man, Moses, obtains from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pardon for six hundred thousand men in arms; and Stephen, the imitator of the Lord, and the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in Christ, begs forgiveness for his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>; and shall their power be less after having begun to be with Christ? The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> declares that two hundred three score and sixteen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, sailing with him, were freely given him; and, after he is dissolved and has begun to be with Christ, shall he close his lips, and not be able to utter a word in behalf of those who throughout the whole world believed at his preaching of the Gospel? And shall the living dog Vigilantius be better than that dead lion? ("Contra Vigilant.", n. 6, in P.L., XXIII, 344). </blockquote>

<p>The chief objections raised against the intercession and invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are that these doctrines are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and trust which we should have in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; that they are a denial of the all-sufficient merits of Christ; and that they cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from Scripture and the Fathers. Thus Article 22 of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> says: "The Romish <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the Invocation of Saints is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>(1) In the article <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">ADORATION</a> it has been clearly shown that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is entirely different from the supreme <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, and is indeed paid to them only as His servants and friends. "By honouring the Saints who have slept in the Lord, by invoking their intercession and venerating their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and ashes, so far is the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from being diminished that it is very much increased, in proportion as the hope of men is thus more excited and confirmed, and they are encouraged to the imitation of the Saints" (Cat. of the Council of Trent, pt. III, c. ii, q. 11). We can, of course, address our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> directly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He can hear us without the intervention of any creature. But this does not prevent us from asking the help of our fellow-creatures who may be more pleasing to Him than we are. It is not because our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and trust in Him are weak, nor because His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and mercy to us are less; rather is it because we are encouraged by His <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> to approach Him at times through His servants, as we shall presently see. As pointed out by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, we invoke the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in quite different language from that addressed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We ask Him to have mercy upon us and Himself to grant us whatever we require; whereas we ask the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, i.e. to join their petitions with ours. However, we should here bear in mind <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine's</a> remarks: "When we say that nothing should be asked of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> but their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for us, the question is not about the words, but the sense of the words. For as far as the words go, it is lawful to say: 'St. Peter, pity me, save me, open for me the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>'; also, 'Give me health of body, patience, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude'</a>, etc., provided that we mean 'save and pity me by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for me'; 'grant me this or that by thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and merits.' For so speaks <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> (Orat. xviii &mdash; according to others, xxiv &mdash; "De S. Cypriano" in P.G., XXXV, 1193; "Orat. de S. Athan.: In Laud. S. Athanas.", Orat. xxi, in P.G., XXXV, 1128); in "De Sanct. Beatif.", I, 17. The supreme act of impetration, sacrifice, is never offered to any creature. "Although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been accustomed at times to celebrate certain Masses in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and memory of the Saints, it does not follow that she teaches that sacrifice is offered unto them, but unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, who <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> them; whence neither is the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wont to say 'I offer sacrifice to thee, Peter, or Paul', but, giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their victories, he implores their patronage, that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, whose memory we celebrate upon earth" (Council of Trent, Sess. XXII, c. iii). The Collyridians, or Philomarianites, offered little cakes in sacrifice to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; but the practice was condemned by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (H&aelig;r., lxxix, in P.G., XLI, 740); Leontius Byzant., "Contra Nest. et Eutych.", III, 6, in P.G., LXXXVI, 1364; and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John of Damascus</a> (H&aelig;r., lxxix, in P.G., XCIV, 728).

<p>(2) The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of one Mediator, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in no way excludes the invocation and intercession of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. All merit indeed comes through Him; but this does not make it unlawful to ask our fellow-creatures, whether here on earth or already in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, to help us by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The same Apostle who insists so strongly on the sole mediatorship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, earnestly begs the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his brethren: "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for me to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs30">Romans 15:30</a>); and he himself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for them: "I give thanks to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in every remembrance of you, always in all my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> making supplication for you all" (<a href="../bible/phi001.htm#vrs3">Philippians 1:3-4</a>). If the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the brethren on earth do not derogate from the glory and dignity of the Mediator, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, neither do the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>(3) As regards the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the Fathers, we can show that the principle and the practice of invoking the aid of our fellow-creatures are clearly laid down in both. That the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have an interest in the welfare of men is clear from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words: "There shall be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon one sinner doing penance" (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#vrs10">Luke 15:10</a>). In verse 7 He says simply: "There shall be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". Cf. <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs10">Matthew 18:10</a>; <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs14">Hebrews 1:14</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for men is plain from the vision of the Prophet Zacharias: "And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord answered, and said: O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> . . . and the Lord answered the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> . . . good words, comfortable words" (<a href="../bible/zec001.htm#vrs12">Zechariah 1:12, 13</a>). And the <a href="../cathen/12640b.htm">angel Raphael</a> says: "When thou didst <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with tears . . . I offered thy <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the Lord" (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs12">Tobit 12:12</a>) The combination of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> both of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is seen in the vision of St. John: "And another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came, and stood before the altar, having a golden <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a>; and there was given to him much <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, that he should offer of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> upon the golden altar, which is before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the smoke of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ascended up before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the hand of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev008.htm#vrs3">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself commanded Abimelech to have recourse to Abraham's intercession: "He shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for thee, and thou shalt live. . . . And when Abraham <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> healed Abimelech" (<a href="../bible/gen020.htm#vrs7">Genesis 20:7, 17</a>). So, too, in the case of Job's friends He said: "Go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a>; and my servant Job shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you: his face I will accept" (<a href="../bible/job042.htm#vrs8">Job 42:8</a>). Intercession is indeed prominent in several passages in this same Book of Job: "Call now if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> (v, 1);" If there shall be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaking for him . . . He shall have mercy on him, and shall say: Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption" (xxxiii, 23). "They [the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>] appear as intercessors for men with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bringing men's needs before Him, mediating in their behalf. This work is easily connected with their general office of labouring for the good of men" (Dillman on Job, p. 44). Moses is constantly spoken of as "mediator': "I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you" (<a href="../bible/deu005.htm#vrs5">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>; cf. Galatians 3:19, 20). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in none of the passages of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> mention is made of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, i. e; holy men already departed from this life; but this is in keeping with the imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the state of the dead, who were still in Limbo. The general principle of intercession and invocation of fellow-creatures is, however, stated in terms which admit of no denial; and this principle would in due course be applied to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as soon as their position was defined. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> already departed would be comparatively small in the early days.

<p>The greatest of the Fathers in the succeeding centuries speak plainly both of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and practice of intercession and invocation. "But not the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a> [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>] alone <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> sincerely, but also the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> . . . as also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who have already fallen asleep (<em>ai te ton prokekoimemenon hagion psychai</em>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, "De Oratione", n. xi, in P.G., XI, 448). In many other places <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> uses similar expressions; indeed it may be said that there is hardly any treatise or <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> in which he does not refer to the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, writing to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a>, says: "Let us be mutually mindful of each other, let us ever <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for each other, and if one of us shall, by the speediness of the Divine vouchsafement, depart hence first, let our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> continue in the presence of the Lord, let not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for our brethren and sisters cease in the presence of the mercy of the Father" (Ep. lvii, in P.L., IV, 358). "To those who would fain stand, neither the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> nor the defences of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are wanting" (St. Hilary, "In Ps. cxxiv", n. 5, 6, in P.L., X, 682). "We then commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us, first, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, apostles, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and intercessions, may receive our petitions" (<a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, "Cat. Myst.", v, n. 9) in P.G., XXXIII, 1166). "Remember me, ye heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ye brethren of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, supplicate the Saviour earnestly for me, that I may be freed though Christ from him that fights against me day by day" (<a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem Syrus</a>, "De Timore Anim.", in fin.). "Ye victorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who endured torments gladly for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour; ye who have boldness of speech towards the Lord Himself; ye <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, intercede for us who are timid and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> men, full of <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">sloth</a>, that the grace of Christ may come upon us, and enlighten the hearts of all of us that so we may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him" (St. Ephraem, "Encom. in Mart."). "Do thou, [Ephraem] that art standing at the Divine altar, and art ministering with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the life-giving and most <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, bear us all in remembrance, petitioning for us the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the fruition of an everlasting kingdom" (<a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, "De vita Ephraemi", in fin., P.G., XLVI, 850). "Mayest thou [<a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>] look down from above propitiously upon us, and guide our word and life; and shepherd [or shepherd with me] this sacred flock . . . gladdening us with a more perfect and clear illumination of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, before Which thou standest" (<a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, Orat. xvii &mdash; according to others, xxiv &mdash; "De S. Cypr.", P.G., XXXV, 1193). In like manner does <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to St. Athanasius (Orat. xxi, "In laud. S. Athan.", P.G., XXXV, 1128). "O holy choir! O sacred band! O unbroken host of warriors! O common guardians of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>! Ye gracious sharers of our cares! Ye co-operators in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>! Most powerful intercessors!" (St.Basil, "Hom. in XL Mart.", P.G., XXXI, 524). "May Peter, who wept so efficaciously for himself, weep for us and turn towards us <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> benignant countenance" (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, "Hexaem.", V, xxv, n. 90, in P.L., XIV, 242). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> has been quoted above. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> frequently speaks of invocation and intercession in his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, e.g. "When thou perceivest that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is chastening thee, fly not to His enemies . . . but to His friends, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and those who were pleasing to Him, and who have great power" (<em>parresian</em>, "boldness of speech" &mdash; Orat. VIII, "Adv. Jud.", n. 6, in P.G., XLVIII, 937). "He that wears the purple, laying aside his pomp, stands begging of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to be his patrons with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he that wears the diadem begs the Tent-maker and the Fisherman as patrons, even though they be dead" ("Hom. xxvi, in II Ep. ad Cor.", n. 5, in P.G., LXI, 581). "At the Lord's table we do not commemorate <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the same way that we do others who rest in peace so as to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, but rather that they may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us that we may follow in their footsteps" (St. Augustine, "In Joann.", tr. lxxxiv, in P.L., XXXIV, 1847).

<p><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> occur in almost all the ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. Thus in the Liturgy of St. Basil: "By the command of Thine only-begotten Son we communicate with the memory of Thy <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> . . . by whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications have mercy upon us all, and deliver us for the sake of Thy holy name which is invoked upon us". Cf. the <a href="../cathen/08371a.htm">Liturgy of Jerusalem</a>, the Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, the Liturgy of Nestorius, the Coptic Liturgy of St. Cyril, etc. That these commemorations are not later additions is manifest from the words of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>: "We then commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us, first, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, apostles, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and intercessions may receive our petitions" ("Cat. Myst.", v, in P.G., XXXIII, 1113). (See <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, "Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio", Paris, 1716.)

<p>We readily admit that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is a development from the teaching of Scripture and that the practice is open to abuse. But if the carefully-worded and wholesome decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> be adhered to, there is nothing in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or practice which deserves the condemnation expressed in Article xxii of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican religion</a>. Indeed the High Church <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> contend that it is not the invocation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that is here rejected, but only the "Romish doctrine", i.e. the excesses prevailing at the time and afterwards condemned by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. "In principle there is no question herein between us and any other portion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. . . . Let not that most ancient custom, common to the Universal Church, as well Greek as Latin, of addressing <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> and Saints in the way we have said, be condemned as impious, or as vain and foolish" [Forbes, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Brechin (<a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>), "Of the Thirty-nine Articles", p. 422]. The reformed Churches, as a body, reject the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Article xxi of the Augsburg Confession says: "Scripture does not teach us to invoke the Saints, or to ask for help from the Saints; for it puts before us Christ as the one mediator, propitiatory, <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> and intercessor." In the "Apology of the Augsburg Confession" (ad art. xxi, <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. 3, 4), it is admitted that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, too, "for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general"; but this does not imply that they are to be invoked. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, however, reject both intercession and invocation as an imposture and delusion of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, since thereby the right manner of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> is prevented, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of us, and have no concern as to what passes on earth ("Gall. Confess.", art. xxiv; "Remonst. Conf." c. xvi, sect. 3).
