<h1>Interims</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>interim</em>, meanwhile.)

<p>Interims are temporary settlements in matters of religion, entered into by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> (1519-56) with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The interim of Ratisbon</h2>

<p>The Interim of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, published at the conclusion of the imperial diet, 29 July, 1541. It was based on the result of the previous conference between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, in which an agreement had been reached on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of justification and other points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Consequently the imperial "recess" enacted that the adjustment of the religious question should be postponed until the next general council or imperial diet; that meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> should not go beyond or against the articles agreed upon; that an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform be inaugurated by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>; that the Peace of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> (1532) should be maintained; that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and chapter-houses should remain intact; that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> should retain their possessions; that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> should not draw anyone to their side; that all judicial proceedings in matters of religion should be suspended; that the imperial court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (<em>Reichskammergericht</em>) should remain as before; and that the recess of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (1530) should remain in force. Owing to the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in a secret declaration made concessions to them, which practically nullified the recess. The articles agreed upon were to be accepted in the sense of their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and chapter-houses might be called on to inaugurate a reform; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and chapter-houses, that had embraced the Confession of Augsburg, were to remain in the full possession of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were not to compel the subjects of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes to embrace their Faith, but if anyone came to them spontaneously, he was not to be hindered; the members of the imperial court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were not to be molested, if they turned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; and the recess of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> was to have force only in matters not appertaining to religion.
<h2 id="section2">The interim of Augsburg</h2>

<p>The Interim of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, published at the conclusion of the imperial diet, 30 June, 1548. In twenty-six chapters, it comprised statements on matters of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. The points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> were all explained in the sense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, but couched in the mildest and vaguest terms; and wherever it was feasible, the form and the concept approached the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> view of those subjects. In matters of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> two important concessions were made to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, viz, the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and Communion under both kinds. In addition, an imperial ordinance enjoined on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the execution of reforms in the choice and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and other similar matters.
<h2 id="section3">The interim of Zella</h2>

<p>The Interim of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> was meant principally for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, whose return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was looked for; but nearly everywhere they very strongly opposed it. In order to make it less objectionable, a modification was introduced by <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divines, commissioned thereto by Elector Maurice of Saxony (1521-53). In a meeting held at Alt-Zella in November, 1548, they explained in a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> sense what they considered essential points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, e.g. justification and others; they accepted the non-essentials or adiaphora, such as confirmation, Mass, the use of candles, vestments, holy days, etc. The document then drawn up became known as the Interim of Zella, or the Small Interim. In the diet held at Leipzig in December, 1548, it was adopted by the estates of the Electorate of Saxony, and was then called the Interim of Leipzig, or the Great Interim.
