<h1>Intrusion</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>intrudere</em>.)

<p>Intrusion is the act by which unlawful possession of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> is taken. It implies, therefore, the ignoring of <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>, which is the reception of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at the bands of him who has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to bestow it by canon law. The necessity of proper <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> rests primarily on certain passages of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs1">John 10:1</a>; <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs4">Hebrews 5:4</a>), in which a legitimate mission from properly constituted authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is postulated. This is reaffirmed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, can. vii), and in the "Corpus Juris Canonici" it is decreed: "An <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> may not be taken possession of without <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>" (cap. i, De reg. jur., in vi). Intrusion does not necessarily signify the employment of force in entering upon a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. To constitute him an intruder or usurper in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sense, it is sufficient that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> canonical title to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> when he takes possession. Historical examples of intrusion on a large scale are not wanting. To pass over the many violations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right during the investiture struggles of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>, we find wholesale intrusion practised in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the reigns of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, when <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, nominated to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> but whose elections were never confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, ruled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> into which they were thus intruded. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in his Constitution "Romanus Pontifex", decreed <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and privation of dignities against members of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> who hand over the administration of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to one who, although nominated, has not yet presented his letters of <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> have the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before actual possession can be obtained. The nominee who does not wait for this canonical induction is an intruder.

<p>The definition is also extended to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, having been repelled even <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> by their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors, seek the aid of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> to obtain possession under pretext of abuse. As an intruder has no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> title to receive the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> which he uncanonically holds, he is bound in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to make restitution of what are ill-gotten gains to the lawful titular. Even if the latter die, it does not legalize the position of the intruder, for in that case the restitution must be made to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> titular's lawful successor in the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. To remove the irregularity incurred by intrusion, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power must be invoked, as the censure is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from such an irregularity is the more difficult to obtain in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of the title invoked or the employment of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in entering on the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Canonists also extend the term intrusion to the keeping possession of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> by a hitherto lawful possessor, after it has been vacated by violation of certain decrees of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus, titulars of one <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> who <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> present themselves for examination in a concursus to obtain a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> for another by impersonating him, who obtain a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> for others on the understanding that they are to be rewarded for it, or who seek a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> with the intention of resigning it to another with a secret provision that they are to receive a pension from its revenues, lose the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to their own <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, which thus canonically become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>. By retaining possession of them in such cases, they become intruders.
