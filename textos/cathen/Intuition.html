<h1>Intuition</h1>  

<p>Intuition (Latin <em>intueri</em>, to look into) is a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> term which designates the process of immediate apprehension or perception of an actual fact, being, or relation between two terms and its results. Hence the words <em>Intuitionism</em> or <em>Intuitionalism</em> mean those systems in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which consider intuition as the fundamental process of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or at least give to intuition a large place (the Scottish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>), and the words Intuitive Morality and Intuitional Ethics denote those <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> theories which base morality on an intuitive apprehension of the moral principles and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or consider intuition as capable of distinguishing the moral qualities of our actions (Shaftesbury, Hutcheson Reid, Dugald Stewart). As an element of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> method intuition means the grasp of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by concrete, experimental or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, ways of apprehension. The immediate perception of sensuous or material objects by our senses is called sensuous or empirical intuition, the immediate apprehension of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or immaterial objects by our intelligence is called <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> intuition. It may be remarked that <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> calls empirical intuitions our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of objects through sensation, and pure intuition our perception of space and time as the forms a priori of sensibility. Again, our intuitions may be called external or internal, according as the objects perceived are external objects or internal objects or acts.

<p>The importance of intuition as a process and element of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is easily seen if we observe that it is intuition which furnishes us with the first experimental data as well as with the primary concepts and the fundamental judgments or principles which are the primitive elements and the foundation of every scientific and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation. This importance, however, has been falsely exaggerated by some modern <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to an extent which tends to destroy both <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion and the validity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. There has been an attempt, on their part, to make of intuition, under different names, the central and fundamental element of our power of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the only process or operation that can put us into contact with reality. So we have the creation or intuition of the <em>ego</em> and <em>non ego</em> in the philosophy of Fichte; the intuition or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> claimed by the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a> in natural <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">ONTOLOGISM</a>), W. James's unconscious intuition or religious experience (The Varieties of Religious Experience), Bergson's philosophy of pure intuition the experience or experiential consciousness of the Divine of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> (Encyclical "Pascendi gregis"). According to the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a>, our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of notions endowed with the character of necessity and universality, as well as our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Infinite, are possible only through an antecedent intuition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> present in us. Other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> start from the principle that human reasoning is unable to give us the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things in themselves. The data of common sense, our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> concepts, and the conclusions reached through the process of discursive reasoning do not, they say primarily represent reality, but acting under diverse influences such as those of our usual and practical needs, common sense and discursive reason result in a deformation of reality; the value of their data and conclusions is one of practical usefulness rather than one of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> representation (see <a href="../cathen/12333b.htm">PRAGMATISM</a>). Intuition alone, they maintain, is able to put us in communication with reality and give us a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things. Especially in regard to religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, some insist, it is only through intuition and internal experience that we can acquire them. "God", says the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> A. Sabatier in his <em>Esquisse d'une philosophie de la religion</em>, "is not a phenomenon which can be observed outside of the ego, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be demonstrated by <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> reasoning. He who does not feel Him in his heart, will never find Him outside . . . . We never become aware of our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> without at the same time feeling a religious emotion and perceiving in this very emotion, more or less obscurely, the object and the cause of religion, namely, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The arguments used by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> to prove the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, say the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, have now lost all their value; it is by the religious feeling, by an intuition of the heart that we apprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Encycl. "Pascendi gregis" and "II programma dei modernisti").

<p>Such theories have their source in the principle of absolute subjectivism and relativism &#151; the most fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Starting with <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> proposition that we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things as they are in themselves but only as they appear to us, that is, under the subjective conditions that our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> necessarily imposes on them, they arrive at the conclusion that our rational <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is subjectively relative, and that its concepts, principles, and process of reasoning are therefore essentially unable to reach external and <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> realities. Hence their recourse to intuition and <a href="../cathen/07682a.htm">immanence</a>. But it is easy to show that if intuition is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in every act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it remains essentially insufficient in our present life, for scientific and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> reflection. In our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of nature we start from observation; but observation remains fruitless if it is not verified by a series of inductions and deductions. In our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may indeed start from our nature and from our insufficiency and aspirations, but if we want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him we have to demonstrate, by discursive reasoning, His existence as an external and transcendent Cause and Supreme End. We may indeed, in Ethics have an intuition of the notion of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, of the need of a sanction; but these intuitive notions have no moral value if they are not connected with the existence of a Supreme Ruler and Judge, and this connection can be known only through reasoning. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature, place, and value of intuition in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are admirably put forth in the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> theory of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> the intuitive act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is, by its nature, the most perfect act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since it is an immediate apprehension of and contact with reality in its concrete existence, and our supreme reward in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> will consist in the intuitive apprehension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by our intelligence: the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. But in our present conditions of earthly life, our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must of necessity make use of concepts and reasoning. All our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has its starting-point in the intuitive data of sense experience, but in order to penetrate the nature of these data, their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and causes, we must have recourse to abstraction and discursive reasoning. It is also through those processes and through them alone that we can arrive at the notion of immaterial beings and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra Gentes", I, 12; "Summa Theologica" I:84-88, etc.) . Our mind has the intuition of primary principles (<em>intellectus</em>) but their application, in order to give us a scientific and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, is subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of abstraction and successive reasoning (<em>ratio, discursus</em>, cf. <a href="../summa/1058.htm#article3">I:58:3</a>, <a href="../summa/3049.htm#article5">II-II:49:5, ad 2um</a>). Such a necessity is, as it were, a normal defect of human intelligence; it is the natural limit which determines the place of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in the scale of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> beings.

<p>Concepts and reasoning therefore are in themselves inferior to intuition; but they are the normal processes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. They are not, however a deformation of reality, though they give only an imperfect and inadequate representation of reality &#151; and the more so according to the excellency of the objects represented &#151; they are a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> representation of it.
