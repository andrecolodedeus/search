<h1>Irish Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h1>  

<p>Founded by <a href="../cathen/02222b.htm">Frances Mary Teresa Ball</a>, under the direction and episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Most Rev. D. Murray</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> desire, <a href="../cathen/02222b.htm">Frances Ball</a> had prepared herself for this undertaking by a two years' <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in St. Mary's Convent, Micklegate Bar, York. Two other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> ladies, Miss Ellen Arthur and Miss Anne Therry, offered to join the new foundation and were accepted. On 4 November, 1822, the three pioneers took possession of Rathfarnham Abbey, which had been purchased by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> to serve as a mother-house and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The wide-spreading fame of the superior <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> afforded in the Dublin Archdiocese by the Loretto <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> &#151; as they are commonly called &#151; brought demands for their services throughout <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The first offshoot was planted in Navan, County Meath, in the year 1833. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> has now a filiation in Mullingar. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in North Great George's Street and Stephen's Green, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, come next in the order of foundations. The year 1836 was signalized by the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Most Rev. D. Murray</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that: "Those who have associated themselves and shall hereafter associate themselves to this institute cannot depart to another, even though observing rules of a more rigid discipline without the express permission of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>." The year 1840 was marked by the erection of the first church in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> dedicated to the Sacred Heart, in Loretto Abbey, Rathfarnham. The same year saw the building of a smaller, but very beautiful, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in Dalkey, and also the opening of negotiations for another <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in Gorey, which prepared the way for a future Loretto in the town of Wexford.

<p>In spite of her prudent reluctance to favour the repeated applications for an extension of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> sisters' work into foreign countries, <a href="../cathen/02222b.htm">Reverend Mother Ball</a> at last yielded to the solicitations of Dr. Carew, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, and sanctioned the departure of volunteers for the Indian mission on 23 August, 1841. To Loretto House, <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, have been added <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in Darjeeling, Lucknow, Assansol, Intally, <a href="../cathen/13796a.htm">Simla</a>, etc. In addition to the boarding and day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> the sisters conduct <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and attend diligently to the religious instruction of adults. The success in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> led to an appeal for <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from Dr. Collier, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, which appeal was granted in 1846. Immediately afterwards the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a> urged a like petition. Two Loretto <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> are established on the Rock. The Most Rev. Dr. Power, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, begged for a Loretto community in 1847. The under-named filiations own Loretto Abbey, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, as their headhouse: the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in the city and suburbs, likewise in <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, Lyndsay, <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>, Niagara Falls, <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>, Stratford, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Joliet, and <a href="../cathen/13487a.htm">Sault Sainte Marie</a>. The foundations in Fermoy and Omagh (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>) were supplied with members from Rathfarnham in the years 1853-5. The former has two filiations &#151; at Youghal and Clonmel. The Letterkenny Loretto was the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> founded in the <a href="../cathen/12647a.htm">Diocese of Raphoe</a>, County Donegal, since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Bray, Baymount, Kilkenny, and Killarney were also founded by <a href="../cathen/02222b.htm">Reverend Mother Ball</a>. After a lingering illness, borne with saintly <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, the foundress died on Whit-Sunday, 19 May, 1861.

<p>The most noteworthy events in the institute since her death have been: First, the approval and confirmation of the constitutions peculiar to Loretto Abbey, Rathfarnham, and its filiations by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, the said constitutions having been sanctioned and transmitted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> in 1861, for the usual examination by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>. Second, the transfer of the community at Baymount to Balbriggan. The foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, from which proceeded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, Perth, <a href="../cathen/01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>. To the latter is attached the Central Training College for Teachers, instituted by the Australian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and intrusted by their lordships to the management of the Loretto <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Third: large day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were established in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, and in Rathmines, County Dublin. Fourth: foundations have been made in <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and Yalla, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work of the Loretto <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> ranges through the three systems of primary, secondary, and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> &#151; the girls' various successes culminating in the winning of studentships and examinerships in the gift of the Royal University of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. in other countries the Loretto <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> invariably work up to the requisite standard fixed by the extern <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authorities.
