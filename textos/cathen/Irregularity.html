<h1>Irregularity</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>in</em>, not, and <em>regula</em>, rule, i. e. not according to rule)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a> directly impeding the reception of <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> or preventing the exercise of orders already received. It is called a <em>canonical</em> impediment because introduced by ecclesiastical law, for the canons prescribe certain requisites for the licit reception of orders, e.g. moral probity, proper age, legitimate birth, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proportionate to each order, integrity of body, mind, will, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. A defect in these qualities prescribed by church regulations is rightly called an <em>irregularity</em>. The direct effect of an irregularity is twofold: first, it prohibits the reception of orders and, second, prevents an order received from being licitly used. Indirectly it impedes one who has become irregular from obtaining an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>.
<h2>Total or partial</h2>

<p>Irregularity is total when it prohibits the reception of any order and the exercise of every order already received. Such, for example, is the irregularity arising from <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>. If partial, it interferes with some exercise of an order or prevents only the ascent to a higher order. Thus, the absence of the left eye would not prevent one from ministering as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, but he could not receive the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who lost his thumb would become irregular for sacrificing at the altar, but not for hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>.
<h2>Perpetual or temporal</h2>

<p>The former irregularity is of its nature enduring; the latter, existent only for a certain period, as a defect of age.
<h2><em>Ex delicto</em> or <em>ex defectu</em></h2>

<p>The main division of irregularities is into those which are the consequence of crime (<em>ex delicto</em>) and those which arise from defect (<em>ex defectu</em>), according as they have been imposed by law on account of crimes by reason of which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> becomes unworthy of the reception of orders or their exercise or have been imposed on account of certain defects which would be indecorous in a sacred minister. It is not to be supposed however that irregularity <em>ex delicto</em> has been directly and proximately imposed as a punishment; for when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> declares one irregular on account of crime, she does not primarily intend the punishment of the guilty one, but rather desires to shield the sanctuary from profanation. As a consequence, irregularity <em>ex delicto</em> resolves itself <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> into irregularity <em>ex defectu</em>. The distinction, however, must be retained in practice, both on account of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> and because irregularity <em>ex delicto</em> is a result of wrongdoing. This distinction has been taken by canonists from a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> (cap. "Accedens", xiv, X, "De purg. canon.").
<h3 id="A">Irregularities <em>ex delicto</em> or on account of crime</h3>

<p>In the primitive Church those who had performed public penance for a crime, whether <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> or secret, were not allowed to receive orders; and if already <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> were not admitted to higher orders. This was the first form of irregularity in the legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if we except certain prescriptions which appear in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs22">5:22</a>; <a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs6">Titus 1:6</a>). After public penance had fallen into desuetude all faults were atoned for by private penance, and then began the distinction found in the "Corpus Juris Canonici" (c. xxxii, &#167; 3, d. l) between public and private crimes, to the effect that the former produced irregularity, while the latter did not. This was the second form that irregularity assumed. At present, however, a different rule obtains, namely, that only those crimes which are expressly mentioned in law, whether they be public or private, can produce irregularity <em>ex delicto;</em> though it must be noted that crimes to which irregularity is attached on account of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> do not make a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> irregular if they remain secret, while the other crimes mentioned in law do produce irregularity, whether they be public or occult. For the incurring of irregularity <em>ex delicto</em> the act must be external, consummated, and of mortal gravity. Hence, if, on account of circumstances, the act be not a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, no irregularity is incurred; for while it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that irregularity is not constituted precisely on account of crime, yet, as a matter of fact, it is never imputed unless there be a crime of mortal gravity. The exception to this rule is <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, which may sometimes make a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> irregular when the fault is only venial. It is to be noted that penance cannot prevent the incurring of an irregularity. Suppose there be question of a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> crime. If the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be one concerning the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<em>dubium juris</em>), viz, whether there really exists a canonical irregularity on account of a particular crime, then an irregularity is not incurred. If the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concern the fact (<em>dubium facti</em>), viz, whether the crime was actually committed or, if so, whether the act was of mortal gravity, canonists reply with a distinction: if the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> fact concerns <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, then it is probable that irregularity was contracted, on account of the peculiar incongruity of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state; but if the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerns any other fact, then it is probable that the irregularity has not been incurred, for the accused has the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>.


<h3>Homicide and mutilation</h3>

<p>(a) Voluntary <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, even if occult, is a perpetual irregularity both for the reception of Sacred orders and for the obtaining of any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> or office. The same holds for procuring the actual abortion of a living f&oelig;tus. The penitential practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, presumes that the male f&oelig;tus is animated only after forty days, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> after eighty days. All those who concur in the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> as instigators or counsellors also incur irregularity, unless they retracted before the deed was committed and so that their retraction could have been known to the actual perpetrators. As for co-operators in a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, if several conspire together, or if in a public brawl all joined in the attack and it can not be known who inflicted the fatal wound, all become irregular, at least in the external forum. Those who are in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> bound to prevent a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> and neglect their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> also incur irregularity. Homicide for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and just defence of one's own life, when no other means would ward off the danger, is free from irregularity; but this is not the case if the killing was unnecessary or if the act was perpetrated in defence of goods or even of the life of another. Accidental <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> or that performed by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is irresponsible produces no irregularity. When a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> performs a licit act, but omits to use all proper diligence or is not sufficiently skilled, and a death follows, he becomes irregular if he could have foreseen the consequence of his act. It is on this account that <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> declares that physicians wishing to receive Sacred orders should obtain a conditional <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>.

<p>(b) Mutilation, in the canonical sense, is the separation from the body of one of its principal members or of some part of the body having a distinct office, as a hand or a foot or an eye. He, therefore, who cuts off a finger is not a mutilator, unless it be the index finger or thumb, which, for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, are accounted principal members. Those who mutilate themselves or procure mutilation without just cause incur irregularity. In practice, these two points are to be observed concerning <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> and mutilation: first, in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the fault where the fact is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, a conditional <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> must be obtained; and second, in every case of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, even accidental, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must abstain from the altar until the case be passed on by proper authority.
<h3>Abuse of baptism</h3>

<p>This is an irregularity contracted by those who unconditionally reiterate <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> knowingly and openly. In such a case the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and those co-operating in it all become irregular. Some authors hold that the same irregularity is contracted by those who confer conditional <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> where there is no prudent <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was valid. Other canonists deny this and their opinion seems preferable. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who allows himself to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without necessity by a declared <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> falls also under this impediment. It is evident, however, that this does not affect infants <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.
<h3>Violation of censure</h3>

<p>Irregularity is incurred under this head by those who presume to exercise orders while under censure, i.e. while <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or suspended. It applies equally to all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> whether in major or <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> <em>vitandi</em> and <em>tolerandi</em>. But to incur it, the incriminating act must be one of order, not <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and it must be performed ex officio, with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and temerity.
<h3>Abuse of ordination</h3>

<p>Those who in bad <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> receive Sacred orders from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are under censure become irregular and incur suspension from the order received. If the defect be principally in the one <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, however, he is suspended, but probably does not incur an irregularity.
<h3>Heresy, apostasy, and schism</h3>

<p>Heretics in general are irregular, whether they were born in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or lapsed into it from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. This irregularity also includes the children of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the second degree in the paternal line, and to the first degree in the maternal. If the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> embrace the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, their offspring is no longer irregular. Those born of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> are not comprehended under this irregularity. Children are held irregular if born after their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and if the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> die in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Some older canonists held that in countries where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics live mixed together this irregularity was not contracted. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office (9 July, 1884), however, declares that the children of those who die in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are irregular, even in countries where <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is rampant and unchecked. A <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> is not irregular, unless he be at the same time a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Such schismatics, however, where <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is conjoined, even after restoration to the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, remain irregular, as do also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> after <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> after penance.
<h3>Defect of fame, or infamy</h3>

<p>This is defined by canonists as a state of lowered dignity, or a privation or diminution of the esteem of men. It is called <em>infamia juris</em> when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> declares one to be <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> either <em>ipso facto</em> or after judicial sentence. To the first class of <em>infames</em> belong those who are guilty of marriage with a prostitute, who attack <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, commit rape, engage in <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duels</a>, embrace <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Children of those who commit high treason or lay hands on a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> are also <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>. If civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> intend to brand a guilty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> he is held as <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> by Canon law. To the second class, or those who are held <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> only after judicial sentence, belong all convicted of certain crimes expressed in law or who have been condemned to very degrading punishment. Defect of fame is called <em>infamia facti</em> when one perpetrates any crime which forfeits the good opinion of the community. When one's good name is lost only through a widespread suspicion this is deemed sufficient to impede the reception of Sacred orders. In ancient times certain classes of people, such as hangmen, actors, and others, were considered <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> by their very employment, but at present the actual opinion of the community must be consulted.

<h3 id="B">Irregularities <em>ex defectu</em> or on account of defect - proper age</h3>

<p>The Church has prescribed a certain age at which the various ecclesiastical orders may be licitly received (see <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">HOLY ORDERS</a>).
<h3>Defect of birth</h3>

<p>In primitive times <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">illegitimacy</a> was no bar to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. In 655 the Ninth Council of Toledo decreed that <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">illegitimate</a> sons of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in major orders should be held as serfs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and not be admitted to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> unless first manumitted by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the ninth and tenth centuries those born of violated virgins or of incest began to be held as irregular. Various canons were also formed concerning different details of <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">illegitimacy</a>, until finally a general prohibition against all spurious children being admitted to orders was enacted, on the ground that the stain of birth would be a stain on the sacred ministry. At present, therefore, all <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">illegitimate</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are irregular unless they have been legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or by profession in a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order or by <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">papal rescript</a>. Foundlings of unknown parentage should receive conditional <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. Those also are held to be irregular who, though sprung from valid marriage, were born while their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were bound by solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> or after the reception of Sacred orders.
<h3>Defect of liberty</h3>

<p>Slaves are irregular unless liberated by their masters. The same irregularity affects those who are responsible to the civil government for the administration of certain offices or <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, as judges, magistrates, guardians, administrators, soldiers. These are not to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> until they have freed themselves from their civil <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and dispelled any suspicion of <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulent</a> dealings. Those, however, who administer charitable funds or have the care of the poor or <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> are not included. Owing to defect of liberty a husband cannot receive orders during the lifetime of his wife, unless she enter religion or make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity.
<h3>Defect of matrimony, or bigamy</h3>

<p>In canonical phraseology, bigamy may be of three kinds. It is called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bigamy when a man has contracted a second marriage after the death of his first wife. Such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is considered irregular for Sacred orders, because according to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> a second marriage does not signify the union of Christ with His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the same manner as does a first marriage. Hence this irregularity is technically called <em>defectus sacramenti</em> (i.e. <em>matrimonii</em>). The impediment is not contracted, however, if either the first or second marriage had not been consummated. Bigamy is called <em>interpretative</em>, when, by fiction of law, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is accounted as having had two wives, when in reality he had but one. This is the condition of a man who marries a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> or one corrupted by another. <em>Similitudinary</em> bigamy is contracted by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who, bound by solemn religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> or by Sacred orders, enters into a so-called marriage. Such a one is considered to have contracted two <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, the one valid and spiritual with Christ, the other carnal and invalid with his guilty partner.
<h3>Defect of mildness</h3>

<p>This impediment, termed in Latin <em>defectus lenitatis</em>, makes those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> irregular who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, actively, and proximately take part with sanction of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a> in the lawful killing or mutilating of another. The reason of this irregularity is that since Christ was the gentlest of men, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are His representatives, they should likewise be models of mildness. This irregularity may be contracted in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Canonists hold generally that in an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> all those soldiers who take part in it fall under this impediment if any of the enemy be killed or mutilated. In a just offensive <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laics</a> who personally kill or mutilate others become irregular, but not those who exhort others to action, without taking part in the fighting themselves. In a just defensive <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, some canonists say that no one contracts irregularity, not even a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who personally serves in the ranks and slays others when <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are not in sufficient numbers to repel the enemy. Other canonists, however, hold that such a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> would incur irregularity, and this opinion seems more in accordance with Roman decrees (S.C.C., 13 Jan., 1703; 17 Feb., 1816). Irregularity is not, however, contracted by the mere fact of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> entering military service. Defect of mildness also constitutes an irregularity for those concerned in legal capital punishment, as judges pronouncing sentences of death, witnesses, accusers, clerks writing out the sentence, and those who carry it into actual execution. As jurymen with us are really judges, they would seem to contract this irregularity likewise. The law is so strict that a judge who decrees a death sentence which was not carried out remains irregular for the reception of Sacred orders. Clerics who prosecute a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> before a court for injuries done to themselves must protest, according to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, that they do not desire sentence of capital punishment, if they wish to keep clear of irregularity. Similar protestation must be made by the ordinary who allows a corpse to be disinterred from the cemetery with a view to proving that some one had committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Those who only remotely concur in a death sentence, as legislators, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and the like, are not included in this irregularity. As to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who practice surgery there is divided opinion among canonists, and while some hold that they contract this irregularity, others deny it, unless they can be shown to have incurred the impediment of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> or mutilation. Mere disobedience of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as to the practice of surgery by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> may be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without necessarily being an irregularity.
<h3>Bodily defects</h3>

<p>These constitute an impediment to Sacred orders, either because they render a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unfit for the ministry or because his deformity would make him an object of horror and derision. The following are, therefore, irregular: mutilated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, those having an artificial limb or who are unable to use their hand or thumb or index finger; the blind and those whose vision is too dim to allow them to read the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. Some authors, e.g. Noldin, think that, owing to the present ingenious construction of artificial limbs, this defect is no longer an irregularity, as it has ceased to be a deformity. The absence of an eye, even the left eye, may not constitute an impediment if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> can read the Mass without deformity. In case of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is judge, and, when the defect exists, he makes his declaration to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but in practice the Sacred Congregation generally inclines to the severer view. Total deafness, dumbness, and stammering to such an extent as to make it impossible to pronounce complete words are likewise impediments. Paralytics, the lame who cannot properly perform the ceremonies, those who cannot drink wine without vomiting, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, those afflicted with the falling sickness, and in general all whose deformity is very notable are irregular.
<h3>Defect of reason</h3>

<p>This irregularity includes the insane, energumens, and simpletons.
<h3>Defect of knowledge</h3>

<p>Those who have not acquired the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> for the various grades of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> cannot be licitly promoted to them. This defect is one that cannot be dispensed in, say canonists, because it falls under the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. When its cause, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, disappears, however, the irregularity disappears without any <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>.
<h3>Defect of confirmation in faith</h3>

<p>This irregularity embraces neophytes recently converted and those who have not received the Sacrament of Confirmation.
<h2>Cessation of irregularities</h2>

<p>Many of the irregularities <em>ex defectu</em> cease without <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> when their cause is removed. Such are the defects of age, liberty, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The same is to be said of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> if it is <em>infamia facti</em>. If it be <em>infamia juris</em>, however, there must be a formal restitution of fame. If the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> was contracted owing to some <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> it ceases in the ecclesiastical forum at the same time as it does in the civil forum. If a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> was accounted irregular on account of some occupation in life, the dismissal of such occupation or condition will remove the impediment without any <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. All other irregularities need formal <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. In this matter the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has absolute <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. A limited power of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is conceded to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> either by law or special faculties. By canon law a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can dispense from irregularities arising from similitudinary bigamy; likewise from <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">illegitimacy</a>, but only for <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may also dispense in all irregularities and <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspensions</a> arising from secret crimes, except <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> and those concerning which proceedings have been instituted before legal tribunals. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can use his dispensing power, however, only for his own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> subjects. In <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> which is public or <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself rarely dispenses. In <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a> committed for one's own defence as well as secret accidental manslaughter, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can dispense. If the latter deed be public the ordinary's powers extend only to <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. Heresy, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and apostasy are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and for them the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> need special faculties. Bodily defects are to be passed on by the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> must come from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">Illegitimacy</a> as an impediment to Sacred orders is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but it is also removed by a solemn <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. Faults committed before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> do not produce any irregularity. From this sketch it will be seen that irregularities have been constituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to preserve the dignity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the sacred ministry.
