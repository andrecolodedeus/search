<h1>Isaac of Nineveh</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city in the latter half of the seventh century, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch George (660-80). Originally a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bethabe in Kurdistan, he abdicated for unknown reasons after an episcopate of but five months, and retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rabban Shapur, where he died at an advanced age, blind through study and austerity. Towards the end of his life he passed under a cloud as his <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> became suspected. He was author of three theses, which found but little acceptance amongst <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Daniel Bar Tubanita, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Beth Garmai (some 100 miles south-east of <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>), took umbrage at his teaching and became his ardent opponent. The precise contents of these theses are not known, but they were of too <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> a character to be compatible with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. From an extant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of his, addressed to Christ it is certainly difficult to realize that its author was a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>. Eager to claim so great a writer, the monophysites falsified his biography, placing his life at the beginning of the seventh century, making him a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Jacobite <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mar Mattai, and stating that he retired to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Since the discovery of Ishodenah's "Book of Chastity" by Chabot in 1895 the above details of Isaac's life are beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and all earlier accounts must be corrected accordingly.

<p>Isaac was a fruitful <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer and his works were for centuries the main food of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Only very little of the original Syriac has been published&mdash;two chapters on "Grades of Knowledge" and the "Essential Qualities of Virtues" by <a href="../cathen/15760b.htm">Zingerle</a> ("Monum. Syriaca", I, 1869, pp. 97-101), and three dialogues by Chabot at the end of his treatise "De Isaaci vita" (see below). A German translation of some six chapters was made directly from the Syriac by <a href="../cathen/16010a.htm">Bickell</a> ("Biblioth. der Kirchenvat.", Kempten, 1874). A complete list of Isaac's works is given by Chabot in "De Isaaci vita" and "Notes sur la litt. Syr." in the "Revue Semitique" (1896), p. 254. Isaac's works were early translated in Arabic, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>, and Greek. The Greek translation was made by two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Saba, Patrick and Abraham, and published by Nicephorus Theodoces under the title <em>Tou hosiou patros memon Isaak . . . ta eurethenta asketika</em> (Leipzig, 1870). This publication, however, does not represent any precise work of Isaac, but is rather a <em>corpus asceticum</em>, containing treatises, letters, colloquies, all in one. Two Latin recensions thereof have been published: the one entitled "Sermones beati Isaaci de Syria" (Venice, 1506) and the other in the "Max. biblioth. vet. Patrum", XIII (Lyons, 1677). This latter recension is reprinted an <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, XII, and again in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., LXXXVI, 1, 811-86, and bears the title "De Contemptu Mundi". It is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> ascribed to Isaac of Antioch, with whom Isaac of Nineveh is often confounded. The Latin gives but half the contents of the Greek, which itself has undergone a number of manipulations. The long letter to Simeon of Caesarea published in <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai's</a> "Nov. Patr. Biblioth.", VIII, 3, forms the last chapter of Theodorus's Greek. Marius Besson published apophthegmata of lsaac's in Greek in "Oriens Christ.", I (1901), 46-60. The Arabic translation of this <em>corpus asceticum</em> is much fuller than the Greek, and divided into four books. Isaac's writings possess passages of singular beauty and elevation, and remind the reader of <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>.
