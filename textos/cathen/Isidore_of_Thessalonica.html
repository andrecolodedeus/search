<h1>Isidore of Thessalonica</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and sometime <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kiev or <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> (Saloniki) towards the end of the fourteenth century; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 27 April, 1463. He was one of the chief Eastern defenders of reunion at the time of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>. The date of his birth is unknown, nor is his nationality certain. He has been variously described as a Bulgar and a Greek. In any case all his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was Greek. He arrived at Constantinople, became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and was there made <em>hegumenos</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a>. He had evidently received an unusually complete <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>: he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Latin well, and had considerable fame as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>. He was also an accomplished orator; he seems from the beginning to have been eager for reunion with the West. It was the time when the Court of Constantinople, on the eve of its final destruction by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, was considering the chance of rescue from the Western princes as a result of reuniting with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1434 Isidore was sent to Basle by Emperor John VIII (1425-48) as part of an embassy to open negotiations with the Council of Basle. Here he made a mellifluous speech about the splendour of the Roman Empire at Constantinople. On his return he continued to take part in all the preparations for reunion among his own people. In 1437 he was sent by the Byzantine patriarch (<a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, 1416-39, a conspicuous friend of reunion, who died a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at Florence) to be <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (or was his title Kiev? He is constantly called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kiev, though he certainly went to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and stayed there. They were two separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Kiev was the old <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> was made so about this time). As soon as he arrived he began to arrange a Russian legation for the council about to be held at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. The Russian tsar, Vasili II (1425-62), made difficulties about this, and let him go eventually only after he had promised to come back with "the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> and the constitution of the holy Church" uninjured. Syropulus and other Greek writers charge Isidore with <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> because in spite of this he accepted the union. Isidore set out with a great following on 8 Sept., 1437, travelled by Riga and Luebeck, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> on 15, August, 1438. On the way he offended his suite by his friendly conduct towards the Latins. At <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, whither the council moved in January, 1439, Isidore was one of the six chief speakers on the Byzantine side. Together with <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> he steadfastly worked for the union, and never swerved afterwards in his acceptance of it.

<p>After the council, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, 1431-47) made him his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for all <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Lithuania. On his way back news reached Isidore, at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, that he had been made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of St. Peter and St. Marcellinus. This is one of the few cases in which a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> not of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> has been made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. From Budapest in March, 1440, he published an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> calling on all Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to accept the union. But when he at last arrived in <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (<a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1441), and proclaimed the union in the Kremlin church, he found that the tsar and most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and people would have none of it. Then, at the tsar's command, six Russian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met in a synod, deposed Isidore, and shut him up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. He escaped, fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was graciously received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1443. <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> (1447-55) sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Constantinople to arrange the reunion there in 1452, and gave him two hundred soldiers to help the defence of the city. On 12 December of that year he was able to unite three hundred of the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in a celebration of the short-lived reunion. He saw the taking of the city by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> on 29 May, 1453, and only escaped the massacre by dressing up a dead body in his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> robes. While the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were cutting off its head and parading it through the streets, the real <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was shipped off to <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> with a number of insignificant <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, as a slave. Afterwards he wrote an account of the horrors of the siege in a letter to <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> (P.G., CLIX, 953). He escaped from captivity, or bought himself free, and came back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabina, presumably adopting the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> (1458-64) later gave him two titles successively, those of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, neither of which he could convert into real <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 27 April, 1463.
