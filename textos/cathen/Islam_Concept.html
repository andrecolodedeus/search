<h1>Islam (Concept)</h1>  

<p><em>Islam</em>, an Arabic word which, since <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> time, has acquired a religious and technical significance denoting the religion of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm"><em>Christianity</em></a> denotes that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm"><em>Judaism</em></a> that of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.

<p>Grammatically, the word <em>Islam</em> is the infinitive of the so-called fourth verbal form of the regular intransitive stem <em>salima</em>, "to be safe", "to be secure", etc. In its second verbal form (<em>sallama</em>) it means "to make some one safe" and "to free", "to make secure", etc. In its third form (<em>salama</em>), it signifies "to make peace", or "to become at peace", i.e. to be reconciled". In its fourth form (<em>aslama</em>), the infinitive of which is <em>islam</em>, it acquires the sense of "to resign", "to submit oneself" or "to surrender". Hence <em>Islam</em>, in its ethico-religious significance, means the "entire surrender of the will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", and its professors are called Muslimun (sing. Muslim), which is the participial form, that is "those who have surrendered themselves", or "believers", as opposed to the "rejectors" of the Divine message, who are called <a href="../cathen/08591b.htm">Kafirs</a>, Mushriks (that is those who associate various gods with the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a>), or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>.

<p>Historically, of course, to become a Muslim was to become a follower of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> and of his religion; and it is very doubtful whether the earliest Muslims or followers of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, had any clear notion of the ethico-religious significance of the term, although its later <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> development is entirely consistent and logical. According to the Shafiites (one of the four great <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> schools of theology), Islam, as a principle of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, is "the manifesting of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> or submission, and outward conforming with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, and the taking upon oneself to do or to say as the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Prophet</a> has done or said"; and if this outward manifestation of religion is coupled with "a firm and internal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the heart", i.e. <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then it is called Iman. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> axiom "Islam is with the tongue, and Iman is with the heart." According to the Hanafites (another of the four above-mentioned schools), however, no distinction is to be made between the two terms, as Iman, according to them, is essentially included in Islam.

<p>Islam is sometimes divided under two heads of "Faith", or "Iman", and "Practical Religion", or "Din". <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> (Iman) includes a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, omniscient, all-merciful, the author of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> as His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, expressed in the formula: "There is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> but <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">God</a>." It includes also, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the authority and sufficiency of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, genii, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Practical religion (Din), on the other hand, consists of five observances, viz.: recital of the formula of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with ablution, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>. <em>For further details see</em> <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">KORAN</a> <em>and</em> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">MOHAMMEDANISM</a>.
