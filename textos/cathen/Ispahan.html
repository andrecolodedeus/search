<h1>Ispahan</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Under the name of Aspandana it was once one of the principal towns of <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> must have penetrated into the land at an early period, for in 424 we meet the name of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Aphraat. Several other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this see are historically known: Abraham in 497, another Abraham in 554, Ahron in 576 (Chabot, "Synodicon orientale", Paris, 1902,674), two others in 987 and 1111 (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a>, "Oriens Christianus", II, 1305). Ispahan owes its prosperity to a shah of the Sofis dynasty, Abbas I, who made it his capital at the end of the sixteenth century; he drew thither from all parts merchants, artists, artisans, agriculturists, embellished the town with many fine buildings, and enlarged it to such an extent that it was about six miles in circumference, had nearly 600,000 inhabitants and was looked upon as one of the finest and richest towns in the world. Djulfa, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> quarter, created by the shah himself, was, and is still, separated from Ispahan by the Zender Roud river. About 1600 Abbas I, desirous of an alliance with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> States in order to destroy the Ottoman power, entered into relations with <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and both promised him missionaries. The first to come were Portuguese Augustinians from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> (1602). In 1604 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the arrival of the Augustinians, entrusted the Persian mission to the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, of whom a few settled in Ispahan in December 1607. Then came <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> missionaries in 1628, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1645, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> a little later. Although the shahs did not make the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries welcome, they nevertheless allowed them in the course of the seventeenth century to continue their ministry to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and Chaldeans, to erect churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and even to convert a few <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. When the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> <a href="../cathen/13024a.htm">Alexander de Rhodes</a>, died, he was given magnificent obsequies. During the entire eighteenth century persecutions were so serious as to cause the departure of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries, and even the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> natives left the town.

<p>The Latin Diocese of Ispahan were created in 1629; in 1638 a second one was created, known as Babylon, and until 1693 both were under one administrator. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> generally resided at Ispahan and was still there in 1699, as well as the five <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities mentioned above, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> was sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as ambassador to the shah. The taking of Ispahan by the Afghans in 1722 necessitated the closing of these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> establishments. In 1838, when Eugene Bor&eacute; visited Ispahan, there were but few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> left. <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> re-established the mission in 1840, and it was placed in care of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. Their superior became Apostolic prefect; a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had already been established at Ispahan. In 1852 liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was granted. In 1874, when <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> created the Persian Apostolic Delegation for the Orientals, the Latin Diocese of Ispahan was removed from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the See of Babylon, of which it had become a suffragan in 1848. Today this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> directly depends on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; Mgr Lesn&eacute;, its administrator, who is titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philippopolis and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>, resides at Ourmiah. There are about 350 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, out of a total population of over eight millions; they are under the care of fifteen <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> fathers. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Diocese of Ispahan, erected on 30 April, 1850, is under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Monsignor Paolo Pietro Sabbaghian, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Cilicia, and contains about 7700 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, with eleven <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, four churches, and one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The faithful in Ispahan proper number 560, out of a population of 80,000 inhabitants; and there are still many in the region of Durmiah. The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, about 50,000 in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, are quite numerous at Djulfa, a suburb of Ispahan, and have a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that title.
