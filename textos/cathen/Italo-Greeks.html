<h1>Italo-Greeks</h1>  

<p>The name applied to the Greeks in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> who observe the Byzantine Rite. They embrace three classes: (1) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communities which have followed the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> since the Byzantine period; (2) the Greek colonies in the various maritime cities and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; (3) the descendants of the Greeks and Albanians who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> en masse into Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> after the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> occupation of the Balkans, and established towns, or at least formed powerful groups by themselves; they long maintained their native language and customs, and even now observe the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, though in other respects they have been absorbed in the Italian population.

<p>(1) As to the first class, it is difficult to say whether the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> was followed in any diocese of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> before the eighth century. But the gradual hellenization of those regions, as well as the founding of numerous Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, must have affected <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> life. The spread of Greek monasticism in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> received a strong impulse from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracenic</a> invasion of Palestine and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and later from the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic persecutions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> naturally retained their rite, and as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not infrequently chosen from their number, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> liturgy, under favourable conditions, could easily be changed, especially since the Lombard occupation of the inland regions of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> cut off the Greeks in the South from communication with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture, moreover, was far inferior to that of Byzantium.

<p>When, in 726, Leo the Isaurian, by a stroke of his pen, withdrew Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and gave it to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, the process of hellenization became more rapid; it received a further impulse when, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracenic</a> occupation of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, by Greeks and hellenized <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> repaired to Calabria and Apulia. Still it was not rapid enough to suit the Byzantine emperors, who feared lest those regions should again fall under the influence of the Western Empire, like the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Exarchate of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Finally, after the Saxon emperors had made a formidable attempt to drive the Greeks from the peninsula, Emperor Nicephorus Phocas and the Patriarch Polyeuctos made it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in 968, to adopt the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. This order aroused lively opposition in some quarters, as at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, under Bishop Giovanni. Nor was it executed in other places immediately and universally. Cassano and <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Taranto</a>, for instance, are said to have always maintained the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. At <a href="../cathen/15016d.htm">Trani</a>, in 983, Bishop Rodostamo was allowed to retain the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, as a reward for aiding in the surrender of the city to the Greeks. About the middle of the eleventh century, however, Bishop Giovanni II joined the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a>. In every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> there were always some churches which never forsook the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>; on the other hand, long after the restoration of that rite, there remained Greek churches with native Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>The restoration of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> began with the Norman conquest in the eleventh century, especially in the first period of the conquest, when Norman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Another potent factor was the reform of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, who in his efforts to repress marriage among the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> found no small obstacle in the example of the Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. However, he and his successors recognized the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> and discipline wherever it was in legitimate possession. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> the Greek as well as the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the Norman princes gained the affection of their Greek subjects by respecting their rite, which had a strong support in the numerous <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (in the fifteenth century there were still seven of them in the <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Archdiocese of Rossano</a> alone). The latinization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was complete in the sixteenth century. Among those which held out longest for the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> were Acerenza (and perhaps <a href="../cathen/06733c.htm">Gravina</a>), 1302; Gerace, 1467; Oppido, 1472 (when it was temporarily united to Gerace); Rossano, 1460; Gallipoli, 1513; Bova (to the time of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>), etc. But even after that time many Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> remained in some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In that of <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>, in 1583, there were still two hundred Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nearly all native. At Reggio, Calabria, Count Ruggiero in 1092 had given the Greeks the church of S. Maria della Cattolica, whose <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had a <em>protopapa</em>, exempt from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; this was the ease until 1611. In 1695 there were in the same <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> fifty-nine Greek priests; after thirty years there was only one. Rossano still had a Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the seventeenth century. The few native Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were afterwards absorbed in the tide of immigration (see below). Of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the only one left is that of Grottaferrata, near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> the latinization was, for two reasons, accomplished more easily and radically. First, during the rule of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> most of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were left without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so that the installation of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> encountered no difficulty; secondly, the Normans had come as liberators, and not as conquerors.



<p>(2) Important Greek colonies, founded chiefly for commercial reasons, were located at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> (where they obtained from <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> the church of S. Anna, which they lost in 1833, having been declared <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> in 1797), <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a> (where, even in the nineteenth century, in the church of S. Nicola, Divine worship was carried on in the Greek tongue, though in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>), <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (where they have the church of SS. Pietro e Paolo, erected in 1526 by Tommaso Paleologo Assagni), Leghorn (where they have the church of the Annunziata, 1607).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where Greek was the official language of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until the third century, there was always a large colony observing the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. From the end of the sixth century until the ninth and tenth there were several Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> among which were Cella Nova, near S. Saba; S. Erasmo; S. Silvestro in Capite; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> next to S. Maria Antiqua at the foot of the Palatine. Like other nations, the Greeks before the year 1000 had their own <em>schola</em> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was near the church of S. Maria in Cosmedin. Even in the pontifical liturgy &mdash; at least on some occasions &mdash; a few of the chanted passages were in Greek: the custom of singing the Epistle and Gospel in both Latin and Greek dates from that period (Gaisser, "Brani greci nella liturgia latina" in "Rassegna Gregoriana," 1902, nos. 7, 8, 9). At present (1909) there are in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> two Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches: S. Atanasio, belonging to the Greek College, and S. Maria in Domnica al Celio, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Congregation of Choueir.

<p>(3) Besides the first large emigration of <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albanians</a> which took place between 1467 and 1470, after the death of the celebrated Scanderbeg (when his daughter, who had become the Princess of Bisignano, invited her countrymen to the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>), there were two others, one under Sultan Selim II (1566-1574), directed to the ports along the Adriatic and to Leghorn; the other about 1740. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, owing to assimilation with the surrounding population, the number of these Italo-Greeks diminished, and not a few of their villages became entirely Latin. The following is a list of towns with an Albanian population. In Calabria and Basilicata: Castroregio, Farneto, S. Paolo, S. Costantino, Plataci, Civita Percile, Frassineto, S. Basilio, <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, Lungro, Acquaformosa (Cassano Ionico), Marri, S. Benedetto d'Ullano, S. Sofia di Epiro (Diocese of S. Marco and Bisignano), Macchia, S. Demetrio Corone, S. Cosmo, S. Giorgio Albanese, Vaccariso Albanese (<a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Diocese of Rossano</a>); a total of 37,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and about fifty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Five other districts in the same region are completely latinized. In <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, Italo-Greeks are found at Piana dei Greci, Palazzo Adriano, Contessa Entellina (Diocese of <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>), Mezzofuso, Palermo (Diocese of Palermo), and <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>, where in the church of S. Maria del Graffeo the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> is observed in the Greek tongue; a total of about 22,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and forty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Other Italo-Greek colonies were at Villabadessa (Diocese of Atri and Penne); Pianiano, near <a href="../cathen/01109a.htm">Acquapendente</a>; and Cargese, in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>.

<p>To <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of these Greeks <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> founded in 1577 at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Greek College of S. Atanasio, which served also for the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the East and for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, until a special college was instituted for the latter purpose by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. Among the <em>alumni</em> of S. Atanasio was the celebrated <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a>. Another Greek <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college was founded at Palermo in 1715 by P. Giorgio Guzzetta, founder of an <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">oratory of St. Philip Neri</a> among the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At Fermo the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of SS. Pietro e Paolo existed from 1663, erected by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to supply <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for Albania. It was suppressed in 1746. Finally <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, in 1736, founded the Corsini College in the ancient Abbey of S. Benedetto d'Ullano, whence it was transferred in 1794 to S. Demetrio Corone, in the ancient <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Adriano. Since 1849, however, and especially since 1860, this college has lost its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character and is now secularized.
<h2>Ecclesiastical status</h2>

<p>The Italo-Greeks are subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; several times, but in vain, they have sought exemption. However, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have long wished them to have a titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, resident in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and to lend splendour to Divine service. The first of these was Gabriele, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10407a.htm">Mitylene</a>. When <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> established the Corsini College, he placed it in charge of a resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. At present this <em>episcopus ordinans</em> for the Greeks of Calabria resides at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In 1784 the Greeks of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> an <em>episcopus ordinans</em> resident at Piana dei Greci. Naturally, the position of a people whose rite and discipline differed in many points from those of the surrounding population, required special legislation. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Etsi pastoralis" (1742), collected, co-ordinated, and completed the various enactments of his predecessors, and this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is still the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has always endeavoured to respect the rite of the Italo-Greeks, on the other hand, it was only proper to maintain the position of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. No member of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> may pass from the Greek to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and no <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The offspring of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. A Greek wife may pass to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> but not a Latin husband to the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. Much less would a Latin be allowed to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, thus evading the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a>. As regards the Eucharist, any promiscuity of Greeks and Latins is forbidden, except in case of grave necessity, e.g. if in a given locality there should be no <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek church</a>. Where custom has abolished communion under both kinds, a contrary usage must not be introduced.
