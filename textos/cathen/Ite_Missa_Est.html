<h1>Ite Missa Est</h1>  

<p>This is the versicle chanted in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the end of Mass, after the Post-Communions. It is our formula of the old dismissal (<em>apolysis</em>) still contained in all <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. It is undoubtedly one of the most ancient Roman formul&aelig;, as may be seen from its archaic and difficult form. All the three oldest Roman Ordines contain it. "Ordo Rom. I" says: "When the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> [Post-Communion] is over, that one of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> looks towards the pontiff to receive a sign from him and then says to the people: <em>Ite missa est</em>. They answer: <em><a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">Deo gratias</a></em> (ed. Atchley, London, 1905, p. 144. See also "Ordo Rom. II", 15; "Ordo Rom. III", 18). The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> commentators were much exercised to explain the meaning of the strange expression. Durandus (Rationale, IV, 57) suggests several interpretations. It has been thought that a word is omitted: <em>Ite, missa est finita</em>; or <em>est</em> is taken absolutely, as meaning "exists", is now an accomplished fact". The real explanation seems to lie rather in interpreting correctly the word <em>missa</em>. Before it became the technical name of the holy Liturgy in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, it meant simply "dismissal". The form <em>missa</em> for <em>missio</em> is like that of <em>collecta</em> (for <em>collectio</em>), <em>ascensa</em> (<em>ascensio</em>), etc. So <em>Ite missa est</em> should be translated "Go it is the dismissal." (See <a href="../cathen/06121b.htm">Florus the Deacon</a>, "De expositione Miss&aelig;", P.L., CIX, 72.) On certain days which have the character of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or penance, this versicle is replaced by the words <em>Benedicamus Domino</em>. The fact is noticed by <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> (e.g., Durandus, IV, 57 &#151; cf. "Micrologus", xxxiv; etc.) since about the eleventh century. The three Roman Ordines before the tenth century <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the form <em>Ite missa est</em>. The explanation is that originally the people were not dismissed on such days, but stayed in church for further <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> after Mass, suitable to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> days (so <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Bona</a>, "Rerum liturg. libri duo", II, xx, n.3). This is confirmed by a now extinct <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> custom of singing <em>Benedicamus Domino</em> at the end of midnight Mass at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> follow at once (Durandus, op. cit., IV, 57, &#167;7). So the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> obtained that <em>Ite missa est</em> implies a festal Mass. Our present rule that it follows the <em>Gloria in Excelsis</em> (and therefore the <em>Te Deum</em> in the Office) is noted in "Micrologus" (xlvi). Either versicle was always answered by the obvious response <em><a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">Deo gratias</a></em>, implying thanks that the Sacrifice has been offered &#151; is now complete. At Requiems (since they have no Gloria) <em>Ite missa est</em> is not said. In this case the versicle is <em>Requiescant in pace</em>. The response is <em>Amen</em>. John Beleth (twelfth century) says that this arose "only from a general custom" ("Rat. div. offic." in P.L., CCII, 49). Till about the twelfth century the <em>Ite missa est</em> really ended the liturgy, as its form implies. In the First Roman Ordo, immediately after it the text continues: "Then the seven candlesticks are carried before the pontiff . . . to the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>" (ed. Atchley, p. 146). It was not till the sixteenth century (Missal of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>) that the accretions to the Mass that had gradually been introduced (<em>Placeat</em>, blessing, last Gospel &#151; all originally private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>) were definitely recognised as part of the liturgy to be said at the altar.

<p>The corresponding dismissals in the other Western rites are: at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, V. "Procedamus in pace." R. "In nomine Christi"; Mozarabic, "Solemnia completa sunt in nomine D. N. I. C: votum nostrum sit acceptum cum pace." R. <a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">"Deo gratias"</a> ("Missale Mixtum", P.L., LXXXV, 120). Of the Eastern rites that of the "Apostolic Constitutions" dismisses the people with the form: "Go in peace" (Brightman, "Eastern Liturgies", p. 27). The Antiochene and Byzantine Liturgies end with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> announcement: "Let us go forth in peace." R. "In the name of the Lord"; and then a short "prayer of dismissal" said by the celebrant (op. cit., 67, 397); so also the Alexandrine Rite (ibid., 142): while the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> have only a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and blessing by the celebrant (ibid., 303).
<h2>Present ritual</h2>

<p>At high Mass, as soon as the last Post-Communion is ended, the celebrant and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> go to the middle of the altar and stand in line. The celebrant turning to the people sings <em>Dominus vobiscum</em> (the usual introduction to any announcement), and remains facing them. When the choir has answered, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> turns round and, with hands joined, sings <em>Ite missa est</em> to its proper tone, the choir answering <em><a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">Deo gratias</a></em> to the same notes. In the former <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> ten melodies were provided for various solemnities. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is to sing this last versicle to the tone of the first <em>Kyrie eleison</em>, so that Mass ends with the same chant as that with which it began. To carry this out more completely the new Vatican <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> provides nineteen tones, most of them very elaborate (for <em>Ite missa est</em> and <em>Benedicamus Domino</em>), corresponding to the various masses in the Kyriale". The tone of the first Kyrie should always be used. In figured masses the <em>Ite missa est</em> should be sung to the tone of the plain-song mass provided for the occasion. From <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> till White Saturday (<em>Sabbatum in albis</em>), inclusively, two <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluias</a> are added to both versicle and response; in this case they have a special melody (the first in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>), which does not correspond to the Kyrie. At Masses that have no <em>Gloria in excelsis</em> (therefore in the Office <em>de tempore</em> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, vigils, and ember-days, except <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>; at Votive Masses, except those of the B.V.M. when celebrated on Saturday, Votive Masses of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>, and, for a grave cause, when violet vestments are not used in the Mass &#151; "Rubr. Gen." of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, viii, 4) the celebrant turns back to the altar after the <em>Dominus vobiscum</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, facing the altar, sings, <em>Benedicamus Domino</em>, to the same tone (of the Kyrie); the answer is the same, <em><a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">Deo gratias</a></em>. At all Requiems in the same manner he sings, to the tone provided in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. <em>Requiescant in pace</em> (in the plural, even when Mass is said for one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> &#151; S. R. C., 22 Jan., 1678). R. <em>Amen</em>. As soon as the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has finished his versicle the celebrant turns back to the altar and waits; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> kneel on the <em>suppedaneum</em>. When the answer of the choir is finished the celebrant says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <em>Placeat</em> and then gives the blessing. The celebrant himself says <em>Benedicamus Domino</em> or <em>Requiescant in pace</em> in a low voice while the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> sings, because these are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. He does not say <em>Ite missa est</em>, because this is an announcement to the people. At a sung Mass the celebrant sings the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> part, at a low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> he says it. Otherwise there is no change.
