<h1>Itinerarium</h1>  

<p>A form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> used by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> before setting out on a journey, and for that reason usually printed at the end of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, where it can be conveniently found when required. Most probably the use of such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> originated in monastic observance. The early rules of the Fathers of the Desert &mdash; St. Anthony and <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> &mdash; as well as that of <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">St. Basil</a>, legislate minutely as to the behaviour of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> when travelling, and impose various restrictions and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> upon them. St. Benedict, whose rule, more than any other, has exerted so wide an influence over all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> customs, monastic and otherwise, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, laid down (chap. lxvii) that when any of the brethren were to be sent on a journey, they should, before setting out, commend themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and community, by whom they were to be daily remembered during their absence from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. According to monastic tradition, if the absence were to be only a short one, i.e. if they were to return the same or the following day, they merely asked the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> blessing, usually at the conclusion of one of the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, and then requested the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the community.

<p>But if the journey was, to occupy a longer time, a more solemn form of itinerarium was customary. Kneeling or lying prostrate at the altar steps, some versicles and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were recited over them by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, who then dismissed the travellers with his blessing and the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>. This was most likely the origin of the itinerarium as we have it at present. The constitutions of the various orders and congregations usually legislate for the particular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be used by their members before a journey, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of a community to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those who may be travelling is fulfilled at the present day by the versicle "Divinum auxilium", said for absent brethren at the end of each of the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>. The inclusion of the itinerarium in the secular <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> indicates that its use is at least recommended to all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, though not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum"</a> directs that a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> ought to recite it with his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> or household before commencing a Journey; and Gavanti mentions an ancient pontifical containing a longer form of itinerarium for the use of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The usual form consists of the canticle "Benedictus" with antiphon, certain versicles, and several collects. Two of these latter are very ancient, being found in the Gregorian Sacramentary. In some modern editions of the monastic <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> a shorter form of itinerarium is also given, for use "ante ambulationem extra monasterium".
