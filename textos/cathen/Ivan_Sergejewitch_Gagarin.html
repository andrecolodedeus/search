<h1>Ivan Sergejewitch Gagarin</h1>  

<p>Gagarin was of the princely <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which traces its origin to the ancient rulers of Starodub; born at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, 1 August, 1814; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 19 July, 1882.

<p>Ivan (Johannes) was the son of the Russian state-councillor, Prince Sergius Gagarin, and Barbara Pushkin. He entered the service of the state at an early age, and was first named attach&eacute; to his uncle, Prince Gregory Gagarin, at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, on whose death, in 1837, he acted as secretary to the legation at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He was afterwards transferred to the Russian embassy at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where his services were requisitioned in a similar capacity. He frequented the salon of his near relation, <a href="../cathen/14356a.htm">Madame Sophie Swetchine</a>, and was on terms of familiar intercourse with <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Ravignan</a>, <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire's</a> successor in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre-Dame. Probably this dual influence assisted in bringing about his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, in 1842. On 19 April of that year Gagarin made his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Ravignan</a>, thereby, according to Russian law, putting an end to his diplomatic career, and forfeiting all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to his inheritance. In the latter half of 1843 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and passed his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Saint-Acheul. He was afterwards employed in professorial work at Brugelettes, where he taught <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> and philosophy, at the College of Vaugirard and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve, and at Laval. He spent some time in Versailles and, in 1855, was back at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, from which date onward his pen was ever actively employed in the interests of religion and learning. Gagarin's literary output was considerable; many of his articles which appeared in current reviews and periodicals were afterwards collected and published in book form.

<p>As a polemist Gagarin was thorough, and his work as a religious propagandist was of great importance. His grand object was to extinguish dissension and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> amongst the Slavonic peoples and win over <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Universal. In conjunction with Fr. Daniel, Gagarin founded (1856) the journal "Etudes de th&eacute;ologie, de philosophie et d'histoire" (merged into "Etudes religieuses, historiques et litt&eacute;raires", 1862); he re-established the "&OElig;uvre de Prop. des Sts. Cyrille et M&eacute;thode" (1858), to promote corporate union amongst the Churches; and contributed to the "Contemporain", "Univers", "Ami de la Religion", "Pr&eacute;cis historiques", "Correspondant", "Revue des questions historiques", etc. The "Polybiblion" (Paris, 1882), another review in which articles appeared from the pen of Gagarin, exhibits (XXXV, 166-188) a long list of his writings. These include: "La question religieuse dans l'Orient" (1854); "La Russie sera-t-elle catholique?" (Paris, 1856), tr. German (M&uuml;nster, 1857), and rendered into other languages; "De l'Enseignement de la th&eacute;ologie dans l'&Eacute;glise russe" (1856); "Un document in&eacute;dit sur l'expulsion des J&eacute;suites de Moscou" (1857); "Les Starov&egrave;res, l'&Eacute;glise russe et le Pape" (1857); "De la R&eacute;union de l'&Eacute;glise orientale avec l'&Eacute;glise romaine" (1860); "R&eacute;ponse d'un Russe &agrave; un Russe" (1860); "Tendences catholiques dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; russe" (1860); "L'avenir de l'&Eacute;glise grecque unie" (1862); "La primaut&eacute; de Saint-Pierre et les livres liturgiques de l'&Eacute;glise russe" (1863). Gagarin also spent several years in Constantinople, where he founded the Society of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, which aims at reuniting the Greek and Latin Churches. With this object, too, he published "L'&Eacute;glise roumaine", etc. (1865); "Constitution et situation pr&eacute;sente de toutes les Eglises de l'Orient" (Paris, 1865); "Les Eglises orientales unies" (1867), scholarly and comprehensive studies on the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>. Amongst works of Gagarin's more mature years are: "Les hymnes de l'&Eacute;glise russe" (1868); and the very interesting and discursive "Le Clerg&eacute; Russe" (new ed. <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1871; tr. London, 1872). The latter is a collection, in book form, of a series of articles published in the "Etudes religieuses" under the title "La r&eacute;forme du clerg&eacute; russe", an indictment of the encroachments of civil aggression on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> right. The "M&eacute;moires d'Archetti" [<a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1872 &mdash; "Les J&eacute;suitesde Russie" (1783-1785)]; and "Religion et M&oelig;urs des Russes", edited by Gagarin (Paris, 1879), are further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his great activity. Almost all the above were published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. A portion of his works were re-issued by Br&uuml;hl, in "Russische Studien zur Theologie und Geschichte" (M&uuml;nster, 1857); and by Huttler, in "Katholike Studien" (Augsburg, 1865). When the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were expelled from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Gagarin went to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, but soon returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he died.
