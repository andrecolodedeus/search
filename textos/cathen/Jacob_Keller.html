<h1>Jacob Keller</h1>  

<p>Controversialist, born at Sackingen, <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in 1568; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 23 February, 1631. After entering the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1589 and completing his studies, he taught the classics at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and was professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and of moral and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1605, and of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> in 1607, which post he held until 1623. In 1628 he was reappointed to the rectorship of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and was still holding the office when a stroke of apoplexy ended his life. Besides his literary and scholastic attainments (for he was regarded as a genius), he possessed uncommon executive ability, and in spite of his extreme <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> was consulted not only by his religious superiors, but also by Maximilian I, Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who often sought his advice and entrusted to his care affairs of moment, which he discharged with much success.

<p>His principal works are: "Tyrannicidium" (Munich, 1611) and "Catholisch Pabsttumb" (Munich, 1614). The former, which appeared both in German and Latin, was an answer to certain <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> printed by a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> with reference to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> on the subject of <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">Tyrannicide</a>. <a href="../cathen/08613a.htm">Father Keller</a> showed that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> teaching was no other than that of the greatest <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The work on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was a reply to aspersions cast on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by Jacob Heilbrunner, and is a veritable treasure-house of answers tot he objections of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. It was followed by a public debated between <a href="../cathen/08613a.htm">Keller</a> and Heilbrunner, in which the latter was completely silenced. <a href="../cathen/08613a.htm">Keller</a> published four other works which were the last word on the subject, and left his adversary utterly defeated. Among his other works are: "Ludovicus IV Imperator defensus contra Bzovium" (Munster, 1618), a work of real historical value; "Vita R.P. Petri Canisii". Of local rather than general interest are a number of other polemical writings, e.g. "Litura seu castigatio Cancellariae Hispanicae a Ludovico Camerario, Excancellario Bohemico, Exconciliario Heidelbergensii . . . instructae"; "An der theil Anhaldischer Cancellay"; "Tubus Galilaeanus"; "Rhabarbarum domandae bili quam in apolgiae sua proritavit Ludov. Camerarius propinatum". He published a large number of other writings, sometimes under his own, sometimes under an assumed name, mostly controversial.
