<h1>Jacob van Hoogstraten</h1>  

<p>(also HOCHSTRATEN)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and controversialist, born about 1460, in Hoogstraeten, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; died in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 24 January, 1527. He studied the classics and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and in 1485 was among the first in the history of that institution to receive the degree of <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">Master of Arts</a>. He there entered the order, and after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1496, he matriculated in the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a> to continue his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. The general chapter held in 1498 at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> appointed him professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> college of Cologne. In 1500 he was elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and on the expiration of his term of office returned to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where, in February, 1504, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. At the general chapter of Pavia in 1507 he was made regent of studies, and thereby became professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. His vast <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> attainments and his natural ability to impart <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> made him an exceptionally successful teacher.

<p>Hoogstraten began his controversial career by publishing in defence of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, who had been accused of abusing their privileges, his "Defensorium fratrum mendicantium contra curatos illos qui privilegla fratrum injuste impugnat" (Cologne, 1507). In the following year he published several works against the eminent Italian jurist, Pietro Tomasi of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, who was then lecturing in the German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. During his controversy with the Italian jurist he was elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Cologne, and thus became inquisitor general of the archbishoprics of Cologne, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. He played his principal r&ocirc;le, however, in the controversy with Johann Reuchlin on the confiscation of Jewish books, in the course of which Reuchlin's opponents were satirized in the famous "Epistol&aelig; obscurorum virorum." While he took no active part in the earlier stages of the controversy, his sympathies, nevertheless, as is evidenced by his relations with the converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, Pfefferkorn, were with Reuchlin's opponents. Influenced no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, to some extent by the unfavourable attitude of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> towards the Jewish books, Hoogstraten on September 15, 1513, in his capacity as inquisitor, summoned Reuchlin to appear within six days before the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> to answer to the charges of favouring the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and their anti-Christian literature. The latter appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; whereupon <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> authorized the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> to decide the matter. Meanwhile, Hoogstraten had Reuchlin's "Augenspiegel", a previously published retort to Pfefferkorn's "Handspiegel", publicly burned at Cologne. On 29 March, 1514, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> announced that the "Augenspiegel" contained nothing injurious to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, pronounced judgment in favour of Reuchlin, and condemned Hoogstraten to pay the expenses consequent upon the process. The latter appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> postponed the trial indefinitely. At the instance of Franz von Sickingen and others, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> deprived Hoogstraten of the office of prior and inquisitor, but in January, 1520, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> annulled the decision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, condemned the "Augenspiegel", and reinstated Hoogstraten.

<p>Although to us living in the twentieth century the attitude of Hoogstraten and his party may be censured as severe, yet when viewed in the light of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> spirit we find much that will palliate the views then prevalent. Among the other works of Hoogstraten besides those already mentioned, the following are the more important: <ul><li>(1) "Defensio scholastica principum Alemanni&aelig; in eo, quod sceleratos detinent insepultos in ligno contra P. Ravennatem" (Cologne, 1508); <li>(2) "Justificatorium principum Alemanni&aelig;, dissolvens rationes Petri Ravennatis, quibus Principum judicia carpsit" (Cologne, 1508); <li>(3) "Tractatus de cadaveribus maleficorum morte punitorum" (Cologne, 1508); <li>(4) "Tractatus magistralis, declarans quam graviter peccent qu&aelig;rentes auxilium a maleficis" (Cologne, 1510); <li>(5) "Apologia Fr. Jacobi Hoogstraeten" (Cologne, 1518); <li>(6) "Apologia altera" (Cologne, 1519); <li>(7) "Destructio cabbal&aelig;" (Cologne, 1519); <li>(8) "Margarita moralis phiosophi&aelig; in duodecim redacta libros" (Cologne, 1521).</ul>
