<h1>Jacopo Piccolomini-Ammannati</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born in the Villa Basilica near <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1422; died at San Lorenzo near Bolsena, 10 Sept., 1479. He was related to the Piccolomini of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. His literary and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he acquired in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, for a while, he lived in extreme penury. In 1450 he became private secretary to <a href="../cathen/03312b.htm">Cardinal Domenico Capranica</a>; later <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Calistus III</a> appointed him secretary of Briefs. He was retained in this office by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, who also made him a member of the pontifical household, on which occasion he assumed the family name of Piccolomini. In 1460 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a> by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, and throughout the pontificate of the latter was his most trusted confidant and adviser. He exhibited paternal solicitude in the government of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and during his prolonged absences entrusted its affairs to able vicars, with whom he remained in constant touch, On 18 December, 1461, he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and was commonly known as the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Pavia. He accompanied <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> to <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and attended him in his last illness. In the subsequent <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> he favoured the election of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, whose displeasure he afterward incurred by insisting on the full observance of the ante-election capitulations that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had signed. The <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of his private secretary by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> on a charge of complicity in the conspiracy of the "Accademici' offended Piccolomini still more, and his open defence of the secretary aggravated the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> ill-will. The disfavour in which he was held by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> did not exempt his episcopal revenues from sequestration by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Galeazzo Maria. It was due to his insistence that <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> took energetic measures against George Podiebrad, King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> was scarcely more favourable towards Piccolomini than <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>.

<p>He was the friend of students and scholars, and protected Jacopo de Volterra. In 1470 he was transferred to the See of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> and was named <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> to Umbria. He wrote a continuation in seven books of the "Commentarii" of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. His style is elegant, but he is not always impartial, especially apropos of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> or <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. His Commentaries, nevertheless, remain an important source for contemporary history and his valuable letters have been collected and published. Ammannati is one of the most sympathetic personalities of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. He enjoyed the friendship of noted <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, among others, Cardinals <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, <a href="../cathen/03393c.htm">Carvajal</a>, Roverella etc. <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> (Pastor, "Geschichte der P&auml;pste", II, 731), praises his executive ability and readiness, his charity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.
