<h1>Jacopo Sadoleto</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, and reformer, b. at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, 1477; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1547. His father, a distinguished lawyer, intended him for his own profession; but Jacopo devoted himself to classical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he enjoyed the favour of Cardinal Caraffa, and afterwards of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, who made him his secretary. In 1517 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carpentras near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Unlike many of the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, he was a man of blameless life and attentive to all his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was only at the express command of the successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> whom he served that he would consent to absent himself even for a time from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In him were combined in an eminent degree the qualities of a man of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, a man of letters, and a man of action. As a poet, orator, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> he was in the foremost rank of his time. His poem on the recently discovered Laoco&ouml;n first brought him to the notice of the learned. His mild and gentle character, shunning all extremes, and his profound learning fitted him for the difficult task of conciliating the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Indeed, his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans was considered to favour them too much, and the publication of it was forbidden at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until it had undergone correction. He would have nothing to do with persecuting the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In 1536 he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to be a member of a special commission for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the following December he received the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, at the same time as Caraffa (afterwards <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>) and <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, also members of the commission. With <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Cardinal Contarini</a>, the president of the commission, they drew up the famous "Consilium de emendanda Ecclesia", which they presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Sadoleto was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to bring about a reconciliation between him and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1542), but his mission failed. After 1543, when a coadjutor was appointed to govern Carpentras, he was constantly at the side of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, ever urging the pontiff in the path of peace and reform. Sadoleto's works were published at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> in four volumes (1737-8), and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1759).
