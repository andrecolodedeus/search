<h1>Jacques-Andr&eacute; Emery</h1>  

<p>Superior of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Society of St-Sulpice</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, b. 26 Aug., 1732, at Gex; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 28 April, 1811. After his preliminary studies with the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of his native town and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of M&#226;con, he passed to the Seminary of St. Iren&aelig;us at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and completed his studies at St-Sulpice, Paris, where he became a member of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of that name and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (1758). He taught with distinction in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of Orl&eacute;ans and Lyons; at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, too, he sustained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> with firmness and ability, yet with due courtesy, before the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr. de Montazet, a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> tendencies. Partly on the recommendation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, he was made superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Angers (1776), and later became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, displaying in both capacities marked powers of governing. In 1782 he was elected Superior-General of the Seminary and Society of St-Sulpice. His rule began in the lax days preceding the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and Father Emery showed himself indefatigable in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and for the training of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> fit to cope with existing evils and prepared for the troublous times which, to some extent, he foresaw. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> broke forth, he watched its terrible progress without despair; he was, perhaps, during that period, the coolest head among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His wide acquaintance among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, many of whom, in the course of his thirty years of teaching and ruling in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> had been under his authority, and his position as administrator of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> during the absence of the exiled <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and as superior of St-Sulpice, brought many to him for advice. He was, says the historian <a href="../cathen/13770b.htm">Sicard</a>, "the head and the arm" of the party whose counsels were marked by moderation and good sense; "a man who was rarely endowed in breadth of learning, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his time, in the clearness of his views, in the calmness and energy of his decisions; the <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, consulted on all sides less by reason of his high position than of his superior wisdom. M. Emery was called by Providence to be the guide throughout the long interregnum of the episcopate during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a>" (L'Ancien Clerg&eacute;, III, 549). And Cardinal de Bausset declares that he was the "real moderator of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> during twenty years of the most violent storms".

<p>The decisions of the Archiepiscopal Council at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> concerning the several oaths demanded of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, inspired by Emery, were accepted by large numbers of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> assailed by others. To their acceptance was due whatever practice of cult remained in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; to their rejection was due, in large part, the cessation of worship and the opinion which came to regard the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as "the irreconcilable enemies of the republic". Emery did not, like many others, mistake purely political projects for vital questions of religion. He felt free to take the "Oath of Liberty and Equality", but only as concerning the civil and political order; he upheld the lawfulness of declaring submission to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Republic (30 May, 1795), and of promising fidelity to the Constitution (28 Dec., 1799). He lent his influence to Mgr. Spina in his efforts to obtain the resignation of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, according to the will of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (15 Aug., 1801). While ready, for the good of religion, to go as far as the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> permitted, he was stanch in his opposition to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Public religious services were suspended during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> closed; St-Sulpice was taken over by the revolutionists, and Father Emery was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and several times narrowly escaped execution. His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and good humour sustained many of his fellow-prisoners and prepared them to meet death in a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit; the gaolers, in fact, came to value his presence because it saved them annoyance from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The closing of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> led Father Emery, on the request of Bishop Carroll, to send some <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to found the first American <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (St. Mary's, 18 July, 1791). The future religion of the country, he wrote to Father Nagot, the first superior, depended on the formation of a native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which alone would be adequate and fit for the work before it. Despite the discouragements of the first years, he continued the supporter of the institution and welcomed the foundation of the college at Pigeon Hill, and later at Emmitsburg, for young aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. At one time, however, Bishop Carroll feared the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, but his arguments and above all the advice of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> convinced Father Emery that the good of religion in America required their presence.

<p>After <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> came into supreme control, Father Emery re-established the Seminary of St-Sulpice. His defence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the emperor caused <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> to expel the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; this, however, did not daunt Father Emery, who defended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the presence of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> (17 March, 1811) and gained the emperor's admiration, if not his good will. "He was", remarks <a href="../cathen/13770b.htm">Sicard</a>, "the only one among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from whom <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> would take the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." The death of Father Emery occurred a month later. He left many writings which have been published by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> in his collection of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works. They deal chiefly with the politico-religious questions of the day. He is best remembered, perhaps, by his dissertation on the mitigation of the sufferings of the damned. He wrote also on <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, Leibniz, and <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon</a>, and published from their works extracts in defence of religion. While clearly perceiving the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> evils of his day and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> remedies, he did not himself possess the fertility and originality of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or the peculiar genius needed to counteract the influence of the powerful minds which then ruled <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.
