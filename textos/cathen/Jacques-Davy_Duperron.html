<h1>Jacques-Davy Duperron</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and diplomat, born 25 Nov., 1556, at St-L&ocirc; (Normandy), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died 5 Sept., 1618, at Batignolles, a suburb of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and on account of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> soon after his birth. Having received a thorough literary, scientific, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he applied himself to the study of the Fathers and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, especially <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, and in 1577 or 1578 was converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He enjoyed the favour and confidence of King Henry III, to whom he had been presented in 1576, and later that of Henry IV. The latter's conversion was to a great extent due to Duperron's instructions and influence, and his <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by Duperron and Cardinal d'Ossat (1595). While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for that purpose, Duperron was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, a see to which King Henry IV had already appointed him in 1591, though he was not yet in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. Immediately after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> Duperron began to work with untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. By his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, eloquence, and power of argument he won many victories in controversies and conferences with <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the reformed <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. In 1600 the famous Fontainebleau conference took place with the leader of <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Calvinism</a>, Duplessis-Mornay, who had been accused by Duperron of mutilating, falsifying, and misinterpreting texts from the Fathers in his work on the Eucharist. Of the judges three were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and three <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. On 4 May nine passages were examined concerning which the commission decided against Duplessis. The latter's real or feigned sickness and his departure prevented further meetings.

<p>Duperron was created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1604. The same year he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was invited to assist at the meetings of the <a href="../cathen/04238a.htm">Congregatio de Auxiliis</a> which <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> had summoned to end the discussions on grace and freedom. Meanwhile he took an important part in the election of <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>. The decision of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> not to condemn the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinistic</a> system was due largely to Duperron's advice. Duperron became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> in 1606. In 1611 he stopped the decision of the Parliament condemning one of <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine's</a> works, and defended the latter's thesis of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">pope's infallibility</a> and superiority over councils. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1612) he condemned the work "De ecclesiastic et politic&acirc; potestate" by Edmond Richer, syndic of the Sorbonne. In 1614-15, at the meeting of the States General at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he urged, against the Third Estate, the acceptance of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> on discipline and reform. Duperron's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and eloquence were so great that <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> said of him: "Let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may inspire Duperron, for he will persuade us of whatever he pleases."

<p>His works were collected in three volumes (Paris, 1620 and 1622). The first volume contains his "Trait&eacute; du sacrement de l'Eucharistie" written against Duplessis-Mornay. Its three books deal with; <ul><li>(1) a comparison of the Eucharist and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the New Law with those of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>; <li>(2) the tradition of the Fathers, to which is added a special study of St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; <li>(3) the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the adoration of the Eucharist.</ul>

<p>The second volume is the "R&eacute;plique &agrave; la R&eacute;ponse du Roy de la Grande-Bretagne". James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> claimed that he belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as he believed all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> considered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In his answer Duperron treats of the characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of some articles which the king did not look upon as essential, the preservation and integrity of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, the Eucharist as a sacrament and a sacrifice, the invocation of the Saints, the use of Latin, translation of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, etc. The third volume contains various works among which are a treatise on vocation, the Acts of the Fontainebleau conference, a refutation of the work of Tilenus on Apostolic traditions, some moral and spiritual treatises, and poems both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and profane. Duperron's secretary, C&eacute;sar de Ligny, wrote "Ambassades et n&eacute;gociations du cardinal Duperron" (Paris, 1618). Under the title of "Perroniana", remarks on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, political, and literary subjects were published by Christophe du Puy from the notes of his brother, who had been with Duperron for a long time.
