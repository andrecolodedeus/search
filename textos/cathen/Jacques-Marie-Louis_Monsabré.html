<h1>Jacques-Marie-Louis Monsabr&eacute;</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, born at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 10 Dec., 1827; died at Havre, 21 Feb., 1907. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> 15 June, 1851, but soon felt he had a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>. On the thirty-first of July, 1851, the feast of St. Ignatius, he celebrated his first Mass and thought seriously of entering the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Four days later, however, the feast of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, he decided to become a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and immediately wrote a letter of application to <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">P&egrave;re Lacordaire</a>. He had to wait four years for release from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had received authorization from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to withhold that long his permission for newly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to enter a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. In May, 1855, he received his dimissorials, entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/06099b.htm">Flavigny</a>, received the habit on the thirty-first of the same month and one year later made his simple profession. A few days later he was sent to the house of studies at Chalais, where he spent a year in solitude and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In the winter he was appointed to preach the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nizier, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, where he gave the first indication of that eloquence which was later to illuminate all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. After preaching the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Monsabr&eacute; was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Thomas, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he began to give conferences. After interrupting this ministry for several years he took it up again. In the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> of 1867 he gave conferences in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> church. He preached then for a number of years in the principal cities of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and even in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, conducting retreats, novenas, and triduums. His reputation, however, was really first made by the course of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> sermons which he preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre Dame, Paris, in 1869, as successor of the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, P&egrave;re Hyacinthe Loyson. The success of these conferences brought the invitation to preach the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in Notre Dame in 1870, succeeding P&egrave;re F&eacute;lix of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. During the siege of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops, the conferences at Notre Dame were interrupted. On the capitulation of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Monsabr&eacute; preached from one of its <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Monsignor Darboy</a>, had <a href="../cathen/04168a.htm">fallen a victim to the Commune</a> and was succeeded by Monsignor Guibert, who lost no time in inviting Monsabr&eacute; to occupy the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. From this time on, P&egrave;re Monsabr&eacute; preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre Dame for twenty years and proved himself a worthy successor of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> and all the other great preachers whom the French Church has produced. He conceived and executed the gigantic plan of expounding the whole system of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. Not often, perhaps never before, did a preacher succeed in holding so large an audience completely under the sway of his eloquence for so long a time.

<p>The classic and elegant form of Monsabr&eacute;'s discourses attracted the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> class of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. "His intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> made his discourses throb with life, and his clear and profoundly <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> mind enabled him to shed light even upon the most abstruse tenets of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while his earnest and impassioned appeals to all the noblest impulses of man always met with an enthusiastic response." Monsabr&eacute;'s published works consist of forty-eight volumes, the "L'exposition du Dogme Catholique" being famous for its eloquence and popular exposition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. In 1890 he preached the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> sermons in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1891 he gave the same course in <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. On the death of <a href="../cathen/06277a.htm">Monsignor Freppel</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, he was invited to fill the vacancy in the Chamber of Deputies, but declined. In 1871 he was sent to the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> to represent his province and in 1898 to that of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> as Definitor. His apostolic labours closed with the magnificent oration delivered at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> on the occasion of the fourteenth centenary of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. Since 1903 he lived in retirement. In that year the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in which he lived was confiscated by the government, and he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take refuge in a modest little home in which he died.
