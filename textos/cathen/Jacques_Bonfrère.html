<h1>Jacques Bonfr&egrave;re</h1>  

<p>Biblical scholar, born at Dinant, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 12 April, 1573; died at <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, 9 May, 1642. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1592. After having taught rhetoric, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, he devoted himself to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. He was long a professor of Scripture and Hebrew at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he was Superior of the Scots College. Sweert, in his "Athneae Belgicae," speaks of him as a man of rare virtue; he praises his industry and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, as well as the penetration of his mind and the solidity of his judgment. His work in the department of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, into which, he tells us, he had been initiated by <a href="../cathen/04377a.htm">Cornelius &agrave; Lapide</a>, has always been highly appreciated. His "Praeloquia" was, in 1839, selected by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> as the most suitable treatise or general introduction with which to begin his "Sacrae Scripturae Cursus Completus" (I, cols. 5-242). In this work, Bonfrere deals with subjects pertaining to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as a whole. He selection and treatment of topics was largely determined by the controversies of the time regarding the value of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, the obscurity of Scripture, etc. But many of them still retain their interest; and they are all handled in a clear and interesting way. The historical methods now applied to the canon text, and <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> were not known in his time. He deals with inspiration in one chapter (ch. viii: <em>De modo quo Deus cum hisce Scriptoribus hagiographis habuit</em>). The views he sets forth here do not in all respects agree with the teachings of modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. He holds, for instance, that approval of a writing by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subsequent to its composition, would suffice to make it canonical. In point of fact, though, he assures us, no book of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was so composed. He then expresses the opinion that when writing on what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> without revelation, the sacred authors only had the assistance <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to preserve them from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He does not make a clear distinction between inspiration and revelation. (See Pesch, De Inspiratione," Nos. 323 and 324).

<p>The "Praeloquia" were published along with a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> in a volume entitled: "Pentateuchis Mosis commentario illustratis, praemissis praeloquiis perutilibus (fol., Antwerp, 1625). This was followed by his commentary on <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, Judges, and Ruth, to which he added a treatise on sacred geography, composed by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and translated by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>: Josue, Judices et Ruth commentario illustrati. Accessit Onomasticon" (fol. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1631). Bonfrere had undertaken to explain the Books of Kings before his work on the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, he tells us in his preface to the latter; but he had felt the need of going back to the beginning of things. His "Libri Regnum et Paralipomenon commentariis illustrati," was given to the press in <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, in 1643, after his death. But the printing-house was burned, and the work did not appear. Biographers have no reference even to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The learned professor is said to have left commentaries on nearly all the other books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Bonfrere's explanation of the text of scripture shows a very good <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew, and pays special attention to the places mentioned. His erudition is extensive for his time. The soberness and judiciousness of his comments are generally admired.
