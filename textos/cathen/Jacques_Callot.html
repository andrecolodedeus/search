<h1>Jacques Callot</h1>  

<p>A French etcher, engraver, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1592; d. in the same city, 28 March, 1635. His father was Jean Callot, a noble, the herald-at-arms for Lorraine, who desired that his son should become a soldier or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But the boy's inclinations for art were so intense, and he was so precocious that <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> wishes were of no avail. His work even as a schoolboy showed a grasp of human character, and the bizarre and humerous, particularly in people of the lower orders, attracted him. Before he was twelve years old he had studied design, wherein he was so soon to become a master, and had received aid from Henriet Israel, son of the Lorraine court-painter, and from Dumange Crocq, the royal engraver.

<p>In 1604 he ran away to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the company of a band of gypsies, hoping to reach the goal of his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He stopped in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> and studied engraving under the celebrated Remigio Gallina, and copied the work of the masters, thus tempering his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the grotesque. The young runaway was soon sent home, to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> finally consented to his accompanying the envoy of Duke Henry II to the Papal Court. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he practised engraving and etching and invented a hard varnish for grounding copper-plates. When he left <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1621 or 1622) his fame was already great, and it soon became world-wide. He engraved for the Infanta Eugenia in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and for Louis XIII in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It is said that when the French monarch in 1633 commanded Callot to engrave a plate commemorative of the fall of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> the artist cried that he "would rather cut off his right hand than use it on such a work".

<p>If little is known of his intimate life and traits, his 1600 plates afford full information concerning the artistic side of his career. Callot was often ugly in his realism, but he was a master of the art of design, clear in drawing, fertile in invention, precise in line, and varied in his style. The freedom and na&#239;vet&eacute; in his small figures, the lifelike manner in which he treated them, and the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> with which he arranged complicated groups made him the pioneer of methods followed by Rembrandt and his forerunners. The Macaberesque note in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art is dominant in his work, and there is a piquancy and newness given to the slightest details. A peculiarity in nearly all his figures is the smallness of the heads in proportion to the bodies. His landscapes are inferior to his figure-pieces and <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> plates, though the latter are of great historical and topographical interest ("La Tourde Nesle" with "the Old Louvre"). No authentic finished <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by Callot exists among the great collections, and it is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> if he ever completed a work in oil. The master of the grotesque and humerous was the father of etching in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and his fame comes from his etchings, which are better than his engravings. He frequently spoiled his splendid point-work with the burin, and his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as an aquafortist depends, therefore, more on what he did than on how he did it. Notable among his works are eighteen plates entitled "The Miseries of War"; twenty-five plates of beggars; "The Holy Family"; "Cosmo III, Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>"; "Charles III of Lorraine". His last years were spent industriously in <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, where he died. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (Cordeliers). He was noted for his loyalty and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> as a subject of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, and for his generosity, probity, and kindness of heart as a citizen.
