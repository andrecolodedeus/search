<h1>Jacques Cartier</h1>  

<p>The discoverer of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, b. at Saint-Malo, Brittany, in 1491; d. 1 September, 1557. Little is known of his youth, but it is probable that he followed some of his countrymen on their adventurous expeditions to Newfoundland or to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. Cartier offered his services to Philippe de Chabot, Seigneur de Brion and Admiral of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at a time when <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> was about to renew those attempts at French colonization in which Thomas Aubert (1508), Jean Denys (1506), the Baron de L&eacute;ry (1528), the brothers Parmentier (1520) and <a href="../cathen/15364a.htm">Verrazano the Florentine</a> (1523) had been the principal agents. His reputation as a mariner marked him out for preferment. Two small ships of sixty tons, equipped with sixty men each, were placed at his disposition; he set sail, 20 April, 1534, from Saint-Malo, and in twenty days made Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland. Continuing his explorations northwards, Cartier entered the Strait of Belle Isle and explored the coast of Labrador as far as Brest, then, turning south, followed western coast of <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a> as far as Cape St. John. He then sailed towards the Magdalen Islands, which, as well as Prince Edward Island, he sighted, and advancing towards the west, he visited the entrance of the Miramichi River, Chaleurs Bay and Gasp&eacute; Basin. Thence, crossing the estuary of the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> to the northern coast, he shaped his course back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The first voyage lasted 137 days. On his return, Cartier made a circumstantial report of his expedition, and next year the king offered him a commission to continue his exploration. Three ships, fitted out with 110 men, set sail 26 May, 1535, and this time determined to attempt the ascent of the great river, Cartier went up as far as Hochelaga (Montreal), returning to pass the winter at Stadacona (Quebec), near which were four or five Indian villages. Having entrenched himself at the mouth of the River Lairet, a tributary of the Sainte-Croix, he was able to live quietly during the winter, but unfortunately the scurvy broke out among his companions of whom twenty-five died. After planting a cross on the spot where they had wintered, Cartier sailed for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (6 May). He arrived safely at Saint-Malo, 16 July.

<p>During a third voyage to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, undertaken in the year 1541, with five ships, Jacques Cartier passed the winter at the entrance of the River Cap-Rouge, fortifying his position for fear of being molested by the neighbouring savages. At this place, which he named Charlesbourg-Royal, Cartier awaited the arrival of the Sieur de Roberval, whom the king had charged to colonize <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1540). However, the spring having arrived without Roberval, Cartier thought it wise to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Reaching Newfoundland, he met Roberval, who wished him to return to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Cartier, however, persisted in setting sail for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the issue of Roberval's attempts at colonization afterwards justified the conduct of the discoverer of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as solicitous as was Cartier himself for the safety of Roberval, resolved to send an expedition to his relief. Cartier assumed command of this expedition, and hence his fourth voyage (1543) of which we have no details. After that he crossed the sea no more, but retired to his manor of Limoilou, near Saint-Malo, where he remained until his death.
