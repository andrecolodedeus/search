<h1>Jacques and Jean de Lamberville</h1>  

<h2>Jacques de Lamberville</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, b. at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, 1641; d. at Quebec, 1710. He joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in 1661, and proceeded to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1675 to labour almost uninterruptedly on the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> missions until his death. At Onondaga he discerned the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a saint in the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> captive, Catherine Tegakwitha, whom he instructed and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. He helped his brother Jean to pacify the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, irritated by Governor de la Barres untimely campaign. After a few years of respite in Quebec and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, he returned to Onondaga at the request of the natives, only to leave it in 1709 through the intrigues of Abraham Schuyler. Like his elder brother, he lived among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> during a period when the rivalry of the French and English to secure the alliance of that fierce nation endangered the lives of the missionaries. Charlevoix says he was "one of the holiest missionaries of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>"; he was called the "Divine man" by the Indians.
<h2>Jean de Lamberville</h2>

<p>Elder brother of the preceding and also a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, b. at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, 1633; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1714. He joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in 1656, and came to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1669. He spent fourteen years with the Onondaga <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. His patriotic aim was to maintain peace between the French and the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, with the latter of whom his influence was paramount. When <a href="../cathen/04732a.htm">Denonville</a> secretly prepared to avenge the humiliating conditions of peace resulting from de la Barres rash expedition, Lambervilles life was greatly exposed through the governors fault, as he had been deceived into convoking the assembly at <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Cataracoui</a> where several <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> chiefs were treacherously captured and condemned to the galleys; his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for honesty and uprightness alone saved him. He vainly strove to prevent the devastation of the Tsonnontouan villages, of which the massacre of Lachine (1689) was the retaliation. When the Onondagas and Mohawks harassed the French allies, Lamberville consented to negotiate peace. His wise diplomacy obtained a mitigation of the humiliating terms proposed at <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Governor Dongan's</a> instigation, and <a href="../cathen/04732a.htm">Denonville</a> duly praised his ability and devotedness. From <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where shattered health forced him to retire, he tried to come back to his mission, but death intervened in 1714. The <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> says that "he had the spiritual physiognomy of Br&eacute;beuf."
