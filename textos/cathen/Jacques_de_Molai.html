<h1>Jacques de Molai</h1>  

<p>(DE MOLAY).

<p>Born at Rahon, Jura, about 1244; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 18 March, 1314. A Templar at Beaune since 1265, Molai is mentioned as Grand Master of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> as early as 1298. He was, as he described himself at his trial, an unlettered soldier (<em>miles illetteratus</em>); profiting, however, by the collective experience of his order, he presided in 1306 or 1307 at the drawing up of a very important plan of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> and went to Poitiers to lay it before <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, who had summoned him from the East. This <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> project, based upon personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Orient and the Italian cities, is considered by Renan superior to any other scheme of its kind formulated during that epoch. In it Molai shows his implicit confidence in the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whose victim he was soon to become. At the same time Molai presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a memorial against the amalgamation of the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> under discussion since the Council of Lyons and accepted in principle by <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>. On learning from <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> the accusations brought against his order, Molai begged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 13 October, 1307, he was arrested there, together with all the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> of the central house of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, by the lawyer <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Nogaret</a>. <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Nogaret's</a> captious interrogatories necessarily disconcerted Molai, who, knowing neither law nor <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, was unable to defend himself.

<p>On 24 October, 1307, on his first appearance before the inquisitor general of the kingdom, Molai pleaded guilty to some of the imputed crimes, notably the alleged <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> on joining the order to deny Christ and to spit upon the crucifix; but he refused to admit the crimes against chastity. On 25 October, 1307, he repeated these same admissions and denials. It is supposed that his object in making these partial admissions was to save his comrades from the extreme penalty. In 1308 a commission of inquiry of eight <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; it was a new form of procedure, and torture was excluded from it. Molai caused to be surreptitiously circulated in some of the dungeons a wax tablet calling upon his brethren to retract their confessions, and in August, 1308, appeared before this commission. What then took place is a most obscure point of history. According to the record of his trial as it appears in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, "Faciens misericordiam", Molai would seem to have repeated his admissions of guilt, but, when the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was read to him on his appearance before another commission in November, 1309, he was stupefied, made the sign the Cross twice, and exclaimed: "Would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that such scoundrels might receive the treatment they receive from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and Tartars!" From this Viollet concludes that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the commission of 1308 attributed to Molai admissions which he had not made. But did they intend to injure him? Quite the contrary, M. Viollet thinks: had they reported that Molai would not repeat the admissions made in 1307, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV the Fair</a> would have had a reason for sending him to the stake as "relapsed"; so, from motives of humanity, they perpetrated a falsehood to save him. Before this commission of 1309 Molai displayed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. When they spoke to him of the sodomy of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, and of their transgressions against religious law, he answered that he had never heard of anything of the kind, and asked permission to hear Mass. The trial dragged on. In March, 1313, he, with three other high dignitaries of the order, underwent a last interrogatory in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> before a new commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, authorized to pronounce sentence. He was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life, proudly denying the crimes with which the Temple had been charged. <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> sent him to die at the stake as "relapsed", and he continued unflinching until the last (see <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">KNIGHTS TEMPLARS</a>).
