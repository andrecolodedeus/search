<h1>Jacques de Vitry</h1>  

<p>Historian of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Acre, later of Tusculum, b. at Vitry-sur-Seine, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, probably about 1160; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1240. After attending the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, then in its infancy, he visited Marie d'Oignies, a mystic of the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Diocese of Li&egrave;ge</a>, attracted by her reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. On her advice he became a canon regular, returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and thereafter devoted himself to preaching; from 1210 to 1213 he was one of the most noted preachers of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. In fact so great was his renown throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> that the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of St. John of Acre chose him as their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He accepted the episcopal dignity with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. From Palestine he went to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and was present at the capture of <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a> (1218-20), an account of which he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The leaders of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> complained of his imperious temper and attributed their reverses to his stubbornness. In 1227 he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but soon resumed the offensive against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Diocese of Li&egrave;ge</a>. In 1229 <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> allowed him to resign the See of Acre, created him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tusculum and later <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He did not long survive his refusal of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; at his request his body was conveyed to Oignies.

<p>Among his works are letters to Pope Honorius, which form an important source of the history of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> (ed. Roehrich, "Zeitschrift fuer Kirchengesch., " XIV-XVI), a collection of sermon-models for the use of preachers; a "Liber de mulieribus Leodiensibus," the most celebrated of these being Marie d'Oignies, whose wonderful visions the author relates (ed. Acta SS., June, IV, 636, 666), finally the "Historia Orientalis seu Hierosolymitana," his principal work, an account, at first hand, of the conditions in the Holy Land in the thirteenth century. He was of an inquiring and observant mind and conceived the plan &mdash; a remarkable one for the age in which he lived &mdash; of writing a geographical description of Palestine.

<p>The first book is wholly devoted to that land and gives its history from the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>; describing the expansion of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, he gives many picturesque details concerning Oriental <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>, the Turcomans, the Bedouins, and especially the Assassins, subjects of the Old Man of the Mountain. His recount of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> is followed by praise for the fertility of Palestine under <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> domination, and for the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, French, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Bretons, and English to colonize it. He likewise dwells upon the characteristics of the various indigenous nations and of the "Pullani," half-breeds, to whose vices he attributes the reverses of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The writer then undertakes a regular description of the <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">physical geography</a> of the country, and gives a great many particulars, half real and half fabulous, regarding its climate, flora, fauna, minerals, its barbarous and extraordinary nations, the Amazons, etc. The honey gathered from the reeds (<em>ex calamellis</em>) was, of course, only cane sugar. A still more curious account is that which he gives of the magnetic compass: "Acus ferrea postquam adamantem contingerit, ad stellam septentrionalem, quae velut axis firmamenti aliis vergentibus non movetur, semper convertitur. Unde valde necessaria est navigantibus in mari." (Bongars, "Gesta Dei," I, 1106.) The remainder of the book is a history of the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. Book II, a dismally <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> picture of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Christians of the East</a>, closes with an account of the monastic orders and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of Palestine. A third book, the story of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, is not from Jacques de Vitry, but from the pen of Oliver the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>.
