<h1>Jakob Wimpfeling</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Schlettstadt, Alsace, 25 July 1450; d. there, 17 Nov., 1528. He went to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Schlettstadt conducted by Ludwig Dringenberg, and from 1464 was a student at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> (baccalaureus, 1466); later he went to Erfurt and Heidelberg (magister, 1471). He then studied canon law for three years, and finally <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In 1483 he was <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> preacher at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>. In 1498 Philip, the Elector Palatine, called him to Heidelberg as professor of rhetoric and poetry. From 1513 he lived at Schlettstadt, where a circle of pupils and admirers gathered around him. Differences of opinion caused by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> broke up this literary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and Wimpfeling died lonesome and embittered.

<p>His literary career began with a few publications in which he urged the more frequent holding of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, the veneration of the Blessed Virgin, and an improvement of the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The "Elegantiarum medulla" (1493) is an extract from Valla's books on the elegance of the Latin language. In the "Isidoneus germanicus" (1496) he presented his pedagogical ideals, and opposed <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. The teaching of grammar should lead to the reading of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> writers who were not immoral and especially of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers. He also laid emphasis on learning the practical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. His most important work, "Adolescentia" (1500), was intended to supplement "Isidoneus". Here he set forth the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> side of his pedagogical scheme. The troubles of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> spring from the bad training of the young; consequently, young people must be trained so as to be well-established in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. He then discusses the details of twenty <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for young men. He showed himself a fiery patriot in the "Germanic" (1501), which involved him in a feud with <a href="../cathen/10645a.htm">Murner</a>. His "Epitome rerum germanicarum" is a short history of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, drawn in some particulars from other historians. In several writings he opposed abuses in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> he took part in the attempt to prevail upon the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> to withdraw the ban. This <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be suspected of having written a lampoon on the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, "Litancia pro Germania", that was probably composed by Hermann von dem Busche. In 1521 he submitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which he was ever afterwards a loyal son. In 1524 he added to <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Emser's</a> dialogue against <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli's</a> "Canonis missae defensio" a letter to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, in which he exhorted them to examine the Scriptures carefully in order to discover for themselves that the Canons of the Mass contains nothing contrary to the doctrines and customs of the early Church. He then retired from the struggle, and was ridiculed by fanatical partisans of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> as a renegade and a persecutor of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He was one of the best representatives of moderate <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a>, one who honestly sought and wanted much that was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but who generally only half attained his desires.
