<h1>James Andrew Corcoran</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, editor, and <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, <a href="../cathen/14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 30 March, 1820; d. at Philadelphia, 16 July, 1889. In his fourteenth year he was sent to the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he made a brilliant course and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 21 December, 1842. He was the first native of the Carolinas who received <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders. He remained a year longer in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to complete his studies and was made doctor in sacred <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. He read with ease the literatures and dialects of Western and Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, spoke Latin as fluently as his native tongue, and acquired that thorough mastery of the idiom which distinguishes the text of the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. In addition, he was a profound <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> scholar, with a special predilection for Syriac. On the death of <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> in 1842 he was recalled to Charleston, where he taught in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, doing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work in the meantime, and in conjunction with Dr. Lynch edited the "United States Catholic Miscellany", the first distinctively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literary periodical published in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. His position as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> editor naturally involved him in many controversies, one being on the life and teachings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>, for which Dr. Corcoran procured from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> an abundance of <em>Lutherana</em>. He had made great headway with the preparation of a life of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, when in 1861 his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> were destroyed by fire. During the Civil War his sympathies were with the South, and the end of the struggle found him <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at <a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">Wilmington</a>, <a href="../cathen/11108a.htm">North Carolina</a>, where he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his fidelity to pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> during an epidemic of cholera which decimated his little flock. He was made secretary to the Baltimore Provincial Councils of 1855 and 1858; also secretary in chief at the Second Plenary Council of 1866. He was one of the editors of the complete works of <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a>. In 1868 he was chosen by the unanimous voice of the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> as their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> on the commission preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. He was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> commission presided over by Cardinal Billio. During the debates on <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which he firmly held, he drew up for Archbishop Spalding the famous "Spalding Formula", destined as an olive-branch, in which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is rather implied than flatly stated. But those were no days for compromises. While at the council, Bishop Wood of Philadelphia, his school-fellow at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, perfected arrangements by which Dr. Corcoran took a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> chair in the newly-opened <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Overbrook, near Philadelphia. This position he retained until death, declining, on the plea of advancing years, a call to the Catholic University at Washington. In 1876 the "American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Quarterly Review" was founded, and Dr. Corcoran was made chief editor. His able articles and book notices were the principal source of its success. (For a list of his contributions see General Index of the Review, Philadelphia, 1900, p. 15.) In 1883, when the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> were invited to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to prepare for the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, they took Dr. Corcoran with them as secretary, and, at their request, he was permitted to be present and take notes at the sessions held with the three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> appointed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> as a special commission. The following year he was made a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and assisted as secretary at the Plenary Council. That Monsignor Corcoran did not bequeath to posterity works of any great size is explained by the circumstances of his life. He was too busy a man to devote himself to literary pursuits. A great part of his time was occupied with his immense correspondence. He may be said to have been weighted down with "the solicitude of all the Churches", for such was the confidence which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> reposed in his judgment, that they sought his counsel on all difficult points of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law. He was apparently unconscious of his great gifts, claiming no superiority, and was extremely affable. His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and his loyal adhesion to all her doctrines, were patent in all he said or wrote.
