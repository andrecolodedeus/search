<h1>James Atkinson</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> confessor, tortured to death in Bridewell <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1595. His pathetic and romantic story tells us nothing of his early life, but he is found in the Bridewell <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, one of the worst in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and delivered over to Topcliffe, the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> priest-hunter, who was trying to wring out from him, by torture, evidence on which he might accuse his master, Mr. Robert Barnes, who then held Mapledurham House, of having entertained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in particular the future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/08451a.htm">Venerable John Jones, O.S.F.</a> Yielding to torment, Atkinson accused his master of having done so, but shortly after repented, and was lost in despair, knowing on the one hand that Topcliffe would torture him again, perhaps unto death, and on the other fearing that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could possibly come to confess and absolve him before his conflict. Unknown to him, however, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> happened to be in the same <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. This was <a href="../cathen/02357a.htm">Father William Baldwin</a> (or Bawden), a man who afterwards filled important positions in his order. He had been arrested on suspicion while on shipboard, and had assumed the part of an Italian merchant unacquainted with the English language, and with such success that he was on the point of being exchanged for an English officer who had been captured by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> on board the Dainty. Atkinson's despair put Father Baldwin into a quandary. It was evident that he was at best a weakling, perhaps a traitor in disguise. To speak to such a one in English, and much more to own to him that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, would be to endanger his life. So he tried to comfort him, at first through a fellow-prisoner who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Latin, and finally offered to bring him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The poor sufferer's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was so great that the missionary ventured to creep to his bedside that night and tell him that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Then Atkinson held back, either out of suspicion or because, as he said, he was not prepared. Father Baldwin's fears were reawakened, but next night the penitent made his confession with evident contrition, was soon again tortured, and died under or shortly after the torment. Atkinson's cause has been proposed for Beatification, but evidence for his <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, though very <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, is naturally hard to find.
