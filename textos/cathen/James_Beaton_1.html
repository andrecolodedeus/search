<h1>James Beaton</h1>  

<p>(Or Bethune)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, b. 1517; d. 24 April, 1603; the son of James Beaton of Balfarg (a younger son of John Beaton of Balfour) and nephew to <a href="../cathen/02372a.htm">Cardinal David Beaton</a>. He was elected to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishopric</a> in 1551, on the resignation of the archbishop-elect Andrew Gordon, and not being yet in priests's orders was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> there on the 28th of August, 1552. For eight troublous years he administered the affairs of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and stood faithfully by the queen-regent, Mary of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>, in her dealings with the disaffected Scottish nobles, who were plotting the destruction of the ancient Church in order to enrich themselves with the spoils. In March, 1539, we find him assisting at the provincial council at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> summoned by the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, Archbishop Hamilton &mdash; the last assembly of the kind which was to meet in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for three hundred and twenty-six years. The events of 1560, the treaty of alliance with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the commencement of the work of destruction of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and, finally, the death of the queen-regent, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> actuated Beaton in his resolve to quit the distracted kingdom. He repaired to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, taking with a great mass of the muniments and registers of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and much church plate and other treasures, which he deposited in the Scots College.

<p><a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> immediately appointed him her ambassador at the French Court, and he remained both up to her forced abdication in 1567, and during the rest of her life, her most faithful friend and adviser. He did not hesitate, after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Darnley, to inform her frankly of the dark suspicions attaching to her, and the necessity of the assassins being punished. On the 15th of February, 1574, Beaton's name appears at the head of the list of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> declared outlaws and rebels by the Scottish Privy Council; but he nevertheless continued to enjoy in his exile the favour of the young king (James VI) who, about 1586, appointed him, as the late sovereign had done, ambassador at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Beaton held several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, including the income of the Abbey De la Sie, in Poitou, and the treasurership of <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>. His intimate association with the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">House of Guise</a> had naturally led him to join with the League against Henry IV, and on its dissolution he was threatened with banishment; but by the intervention of Cardinals Bourbon and Sully and of the king himself, he was allowed to remain in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he was regarded with the greatest esteem. Perhaps the most remarkable testimony to the respect felt for his character in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> is to be found in the fact that in 1598, nearly forty years after the overthrow of the ancient Church, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was formally restored, by an act of the Scottish Parliament, to all his "heritages, honours, dignities, and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, notwithstanding that he has never acknowledged the religion professed within the realm". He survived to witness, a month before his death, the union of the English and Scottish crowns under King James. On the 24th of April, 1603, when James was actually on his way to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to take possession of hew new kingdom, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, on the eighty-sixth year of his age, and half a century after his episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p>Beaton had lived in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for forty-three years, and had been <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> ambassador to five successive kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Lateran at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, his funeral being attended by a great gathering of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, nobles, and common people. The poetical inscription on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> eulogizes him, in the exaggerated language of the times, as the greatest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and preacher of his age in the whole world. A sounder estimate of his worth is that of his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> successor in the See of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, Spottiswoode, who describes him as "a man honourably disposed, faithful to his queen while she lived and to the king her son; a lover of his country, and liberal to all his countrymen". No breath of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> age, ever attached to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his name or the purity of his private life. Beaton left his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, including the archives of the <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Diocese of Glasgow</a>, and a great mass of important correspondence, to the Scots College in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Some of these documents had already been deposited by him in the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the same city. In the stress of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> many of these valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were packed in barrels and sent to <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omers</a>. These have unfortunately disappeared, but the papers left in the college were afterwards brought safely to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and are now preserved at Blairs College, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> near Aberdeen.
