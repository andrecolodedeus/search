<h1>James Bell</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. at Warrington in Lancashire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, probably about 1520; d. 20 April, 1584. For the little known of him we depend on the account published four years after his death by <a href="../cathen/02783a.htm">Bridgewater</a> in his "Concertatio" (1588), and derived from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which was kept at Douay when Challoner wrote his "Missionary Priests" in 1741, and is now in the Westminster Diocesan Archives. A few further details were collected by Challoner, and others are supplied by the State Papers. Having studied at Oxford he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Mary's reign, but unfortunately conformed to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">established Church</a> under Elizabeth, and according to the Douay <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> "ministered their bare few <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> about 20 years in diverse places of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>". Finally deterred by <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> and reduced to destitution, he sought a small readership as a bare subsistence. To obtain this he approached the patron's wife, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lady, who induced him to be reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After some time he was allowed to resume <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, and for two years devoted himself to arduous missionary labours. He was at length apprehended (17 January 1583-84) and, having confessed his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, was arraigned at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> Quarter-Sessions held during the same month, and sent for trial at Lancaster Assizes in March. When condemned and sentenced he said to the Judge: "I beg your Lordship would add to the sentence that my lips and the tops of my fingers may be cut off, for having sworn and subscribed to the articles of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> contrary both to my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a>". He spent that night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and on the following day was hanged and quartered together with <a href="../cathen/06076b.htm">Ven. John Finch</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, 20 April, 1584.
