<h1>James Burns</h1>  

<p>Publisher and author, b. near Montrose, Forfarshire, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 1808; d. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 11 April, 1871. During the last half of the nineteenth century his work in the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> contributed much to the rapid advancement of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Great Britain and to the many conversions that were made throughout that period. His father was a <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> minister and sent him to a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Glasgow with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that he should follow the same calling. But feeling no inclination for it, he left the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1832 and went to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> where he found employment with a publishing firm. He acquired a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this trade and then set up for himself in a modest way. He soon won success and the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Established Church adopted him as an active auxiliary in their literary campaign of tracts and polemic publications. He then became a "Puseyite", or high-churchman. From his press were issued many interesting and instructive books of a high literary tone in the series he called "The Englishman's Library" and "The Fireside Library". The <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> under <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> of course drew him within its range, with the result that, in spite of the great worldly sacrifice it meant, he followed the example of many of his friends and became a convert in 1847.

<p>The change was one of the sensations of the time and involved for him the making of a new business life and fortune. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> publications of the old house were sold off and he set to work, and succeeded, in a comparatively brief time, in building up an equally enviable reputation as an enterprising and prolific publisher of good and wholesome <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. To his "Popular Library" <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> contributed "Fabiola" and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>, "Callista". Other volumes from a host of well-known writers, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> books, and books of devotion soon made the name of the firm of Burns &amp; Oates a household word throughout the English-speaking world. Mr. Burns also wrote constantly on <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> and edited and republished many compositions of the best masters. He continued his busy life in spite of a painful internal malady which ended in cancer, from which he died. His <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who was also a convert, survived him twenty-two years, dying a member of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> community at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> January, 1893. Of his five daughters, four entered the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Order and the other became a Sister of Charity. His only son was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, serving for a long time as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Nazareth House, Hammersmith, London.
