<h1>James Campbell</h1>  

<p>Born at Philadelphia, 1 Sept., 1812; died there, 27 Jan., 1893. His father was Anthony Campbell, and his grandfather George Campbell, a native of Fintona, County Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. James was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Geraldus Stockdale, studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with Hon. Robert D. Ingraham, was admitted to the Bar on 14 Sept., 1833, was made a commissioner of the district of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a> the day after his admission, and served until his appointment to the board of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He offered, 16 Apr., 1840, the resolution which established the Girls' High School of Philadelphia. He served on the board of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> until 1840, when he was appointed, by Governor David R. Porter, judge of the courts of common pleas, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan's</a> court, and courts of oyer and terminer, which position he filled until 1 Jan., 1851, when the judicial positions in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> became elective. Nominated for judge of the supreme court, at a period when <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothingism</a> and anti-Catholic feeling was rife, he was defeated, although his four colleagues on the Democratic ticket were elected. Governor William Bigler appointed him Attorney-General of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, in which office he served until 4 Mar., 1853, when he entered President Pierce's Cabinet as postmaster-general, serving until 4 Mar., 1857. In 1861 he was a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> senate against Charles R. Buckalew but was defeated by one vote. In 1873 he was elected a member of the Constitutional Convention of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, but declined to serve owing to the condition of his health. For twenty-five years he was president of the board of trustees of Jefferson Medical College, and for forty-five years was Vice-president of Saint Joseph's Orphan Asylum, the oldest incorporated <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> asylum in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> chartered in 1807. On 3 Sept., 1869, he was appointed by the judges of Philadelphia County a member of the board of city trusts, which has under its care 42 city trusts, including Girard College and Wills' Eye Hospital. He served in these positions until his death. Judge Campbell looked upon his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, whether as public official or as trustee, as <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the highest order and of great value to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and he was a just and severe judge upon himself as to the manner and the faithfulness with which these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were discharged. Even with all the cares that surrounded him, he was always ready to respond to the slightest call from any of the refuges of the poor and the ill. He made visits almost daily to St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum, to Girard College, and to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, examining conditions in detail, and considering them with as much care as if they referred to his own life or to the lives of those of his own household.
