<h1>James Chadwick</h1>  

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham and Newcastle</a>, born at Drogheda, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 April, 1813; died at Newcastle, 14 May, 1882, and buried at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>. He was the third son of a gentleman of an old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Lancashire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, John Chadwick, who had settled in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> lady, Frances Dromgoole. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw College</a> from May, 1825, until his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 17 December, 1836. He then was general prefect at the college for three years, after which he taught humanities until he was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> a post he occupied for five years. In 1849 he became Vice-president of the college and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. After a few months his health broke down, and he found the change he needed among a little body of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> who devoted themselves to preaching missions and retreats. In 1856 their house at Wooler was burnt, and Father Chadwick returned once more to <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> as professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. From 1859 to 1863 he was <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Lord Stourton, but again returned to <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> as professor of pastoral theology. He was fulfilling these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> when he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1866; he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 28 Oct. in the college <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a>. For sixteen years he ruled the diocese and for one year during that time (1877) he also held the dignity of president of <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>, being the eighth in that office. A man of great personal dignity and charm, he is remembered for his meekness and sweetness of manner. His works include: an edition of Leuthner's "Coelum Christianum" (London, 1871); "St. Teresa's Own Words: Instructions on the Prayer of Recollection" (Newcastle, 1878); "Instructions How to Meditate" (published anonymously), and many pastoral letters.
