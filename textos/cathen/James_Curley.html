<h1>James Curley</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, b. at Athleague, County Roscommon, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 26 October, 1796; d. at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>, U.S., 24 July 1889. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was limited, though his talent for mathematics was discovered, and to some extent developed, by a teacher in his native town. He left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in his youth, arriving in Philadelphia, 10 October, 1817. Here he worked for two years as a bookkeeper and then taught mathematics at Frederick, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. In 1826 he became a student at the old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Washington, intending to prepare himself for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and at the same time taught one of its classes. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, however, which had been established in 1820, was closed in the following year and he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 29 September, 1827. After completing his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he again taught in Frederick and was sent (1831) to teach natural philosophy at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>. He also studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 1 June, 1833. His first Mass was said at the Visitation Convent, Georgetown, where he afterwards acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> for fifty years. He spent the remainder of his life at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, where he taught natural philosophy and mathematics for forty-eight years. He planned and superintended the building of the Georgetown Observatory in 1844 and was its first director, filling this position for many years. One of his earliest achievements was the determination of the longitude of Washington. His results did not agree with those obtained at the Naval Observatory, and it was not until after the laying of the first transatlantic cable in 1858 that his determination was found to be near the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The coincidence, however, was partly accidental, as the method which he employed was not susceptible of very great precision. Father Curley was also much interested in botany. He is best remembered, however, as a teacher. He wrote "Annals of the Observatory of Georgetown College, D.C., containing the description of the observatory and the description and use of the transit instrument and meridian circle" (New York, 1852).
