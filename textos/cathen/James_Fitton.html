<h1>James Fitton</h1>  

<p>Missionary, b. at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.</a>, 10 April, 1805; d. there, 15 Sept., 1881. His father, Abraham Fitton, went to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> from Preston, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; his mother was of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> origin and a convert to the Faith. His primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of his native city, and his classical course was made at Claremont, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, at an academy conducted by Virgil Horace Barber, an early New England convert to the Faith. His <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> he learned from the lips of Bishop Fenwick, by whom he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 23 Dec., 1827. Thenceforth for nearly a quarter of a century the whole of New England became the theatre of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary labours. Carrying a valise containing vestments, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and all necessaries for offering the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, his breviary under his arm, he travelled, often on foot, from Eastport and the New Brunswick line on the northeast, to Burlington and Lake Champlain on the northwest; from <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in the east, to Great Barrington and the Berkshire Hills in the west; from Providence and Newport in the southeast, to Bridgeport and the New York State line in the southwest. In the course of his ministry he was often exposed to insult and hardship, but he considered these as trifles when <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were to be saved. During his missionary career he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. He erected the church of Our Lady of the Isle at Newport, Rhode Island. In 1840, while <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, he purchased the present site of Holy Cross College, and erected a building for the advanced <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men. In 1842 he deeded the grounds and building to Bishop Fenwick, who placed it under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1855 he was appointed by Bishop Fenwick <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of the Most Holy Redeemer in East Boston. Here he laboured for the remaining twenty-six years of his life, and built four more churches. In 1877 he celebrated the golden jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.
