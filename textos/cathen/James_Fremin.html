<h1>James Fremin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary to the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">American Indians</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 12 March, 1628; d. at Quebec, 2 July, 1691. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1646 and in 1655 set out for the Onondaga mission in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to devote the rest of his life to the evangelization of the savages. At the invitation of a Cayuga chieftain he set out, in 1666, for Lake Tiohero, near the present Cayuga, but his stay there was of short duration. The next year he was sent to revive the mission founded by <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> among the Mohawk and, on his way, instituted the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement in <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, on Isle La Motte. Arriving at Tinnontoguen, the Mohawk capital, he rapidly acquired the language and by his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and kindness won the respect of his savage charges. Unfortunately, the Mohawk did not readily respond to his efforts, and his chief care seems to have been to attend to the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> captives who were already <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Christianized</a>.

<p>In October, 1668, Father Fremin proceeded to the Seneca country, but the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> then being waged with the Ottawa and the Susquehanna prevented many <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a>. In August, 1669, he left for Onondaga to preside at a general meeting of the missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but shortly returned to Gannougare to resume his work among the captive <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a>. The high repute he had gained among the various tribes was responsible for his recall, in 1670, to take charge of La Prairie, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> settlement near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> where the converted <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> had been gathered, and it was he who placed this refuge on a solid footing and eliminated the liquor traffic. From that time on, with the exception of several voyages to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the interest of the mission, he devoted himself exclusively to the work of preserving in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> those Indians who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and, despite the persistent efforts of the tribes from which the converts came, he was able to prevent any serious defection. He died worn out by his long apostolate, having been the means of bringing over ten thousand Indians into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
