<h1>James Gillis</h1>  

<p>Scottish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 7 April, 1802; d. at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 24 February 1864. He was the only son of a native of Banffshire, who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and married there <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> in the Sulpician college at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where he acquired a perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of French, he came to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in 1816, and next year entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Aquhorties, studying afterwards at St Nicholas's College in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and at Issy. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 9 June, 1827, and was stationed at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, where he was preaching soon attracted attention. He visited <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1829 to collect money for his church, and in 1831 to raise funds for the foundation of an <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>--the first religious house established in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> since the sixteenth century--which was opened in 1835.

<p>In July, 1838, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09265a.htm">Limyra</a> and Coadjutor of the Eastern District. A subsequent visit to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was much esteemed, resulted in the acquisition of what remained of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Scotch College, and in the promise of an annual grant to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. In 1852 Bishop Gillis succeeded Bishop Carruthers as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Eastern District. During his twelve years tenure of this office he did much for the advancement of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, founding many new missions, introducing several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (including <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Oblates of Mary, and Sisters of Mary) into his district, and receiving into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> many converts, among them <a href="../cathen/06026b.htm">Viscount and Viscountess Feilding</a>, afterwards Earl and Countess of Denbigh. In 1857 he preached in Orl&eacute;ans <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> an eloquent panegyric, in French, of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> (published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in the same year), receiving in return from the Mayor of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> the heart of King Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who had died at Chinon, on the Loire, in 1189. Bishop Gillis was buried in St. Margaret's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, his own foundation, on 26 February, 1864. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of St. Margaret's are in possession of his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.
