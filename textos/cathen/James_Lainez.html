<h1>James Lainez</h1>  

<p>(LAYNEZ).

<p>Second general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, b. in 1512, at Almazan, Castille, in 1512; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 January, 1565. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, although <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> for many generations, had descended from Jewish stock, as has been established by Sacchini (Historia Societatis Jesu, II, sec. 32). Lainez graduated in arts at the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a> (1531), and won his licentiate in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> there at the age of twenty (1532). At Alcal&aacute;, the young <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> and his friend Salmer&oacute;n* had heard of Ignatius Loyola. To meet him, they betook them to the great <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> (1533) and there fell under the spell of his masterful will. Lainez was the second to Join Loyola and was one of the seven who on 15 August, 1534, made the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Denis, on Montmartre. Three years were now spent by Lainez, in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, for the most part in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1537, Ignatius sent his companions to present themselves to the Holy Father. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> discussed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> questions with them. He was struck by their bearing and learning, granted them permission to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to go to the Holy Land. This <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> was prevented by political troubles. Lainez was charged by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the Sapienza. His teaching and preaching were productive of immense good in those unsettled days. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> were saved from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by his labors. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> became an enthusiastic admirer of the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. He chose three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Lainez, Salmer&oacute;n, and Lef&eacute;vre as sole <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The latter died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the council began its sessions. Lainez and Salmer&oacute;n* were joined by two other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, Le Jaye who represented the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and Covillon the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, Lainez came into prominence just as soon as the question of justification was reached. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his followers had gone astray chiefly on this very <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. No more important subject could have come before the council. Long discussions preceded the definition, and Lainez and Salmer&oacute;n* stood out most prominently. These dogmatic discussions, in the early sessions of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, took place without formality of precedence. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussions were under the charge of Cardinal Cervini, later Pope Marcellus II; he arranged that Salmer&oacute;n* should be among the first speakers on each topic, so as to set down the right <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from the outset; Lainez should be the last to speak, so as to sum up the discussion and point out clearly the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of preceding <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were immensely influential against some of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> wherewith unfortunately not a few of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the council were tainted. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> asked for copies of the vote of Lainez and Salmer&oacute;n. While the two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> thus bore the brunt of the battle for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the matter of justification, at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, strong influence was brought to bear on Ignatius to send Lainez to do apostolic work in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Salmer&oacute;n* prevented such a loss to the council by telling Ignatius the power of Lainez in <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>. Shortly thereafter, Lainez did his greatest service to the council in the discussion on justification. <a href="../cathen/13729c.htm">Jerome Seripando</a>, a most devoted and saintly man, who later presided over the sessions of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, tried to combine the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of justification; and defended a twofold formal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, our own and the imputed <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Christ (Theiner, "Acta Con. Trid.", I, 235). The answer of Lainez so pleased the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> that they honored it by incorporating it word for word in the Acts of the council, a unique honor. On 13 January, 1547, by unanimous vote, their clear and definite <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on justification was passed unanimously, the doctrines which Lainez had stood for being defined. Hereafter, whereas very few <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were allowed to speak an hour, Lainez was privileged to address the assembly for three hours or more. We are not surprised to find Salmer&oacute;n* writing to Ignatius that to take away Lainez from <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> "were, without any exaggeration whatsoever, to take away one of its eyes from this council" (Epistolae Salmer&oacute;n, 20 Jan., 1547). In April, 1547, Lainez went with the council to Bologna, where he spoke on penance and extreme unction. The opposition of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> preventing many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from reaching Bologna, the council was indefinitely prorogued. When the Fathers met a second time at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> (1 May, 1551) Lainez (now <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>) and Salmer&oacute;n* were there as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>. During the previous sessions, Lainez had spoken at a time when the Fathers of the council were already fagged out, and yet he held their attention and carried their votes. Now the first to speak were the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Lainez dwelt at great length on the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. It is said that the decrees and canons of the Fourteenth Session were at this time written by him (Cartes de S. Ignacio, I, 491).

<p>After the death of St. Ignatius (1556) Lainez was elected <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>; about two years later be became its second general (1558). <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> now insisted on the triennial election of a general and the chanting of the Office in choir by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. His wish was only verbally expressed, and that by a messenger. After his death (1559), at the advice of eminent canonists, Lainez discontinued the choir, and observed the constitutions of the order in regard to the generalate. A new difficulty now confronted him. Twelve votes were cast for Lainez in the effort to choose a successor for <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, the reform party being intent upon electing him. His entreaties and sudden departure for parts unknown saved him from the possibility. To Lainez is due the adoption of the "Constitutions" of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, and the importance that higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was destined to have in working out in detail the general principle of its institution. Notwithstanding the labours incident to the governing of his order, Lainez still busied himself with the battle of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and neglect of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to the famous Conference of Poissy (1561) along with Cardinal Ippolito d'Este. There he engaged the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in dispute before the Queen Regent <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de' Medici</a>. In his absence, Salmer&oacute;n* was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Meanwhile the third convocation of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> was opened (18 January, 1562). Two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were present, Covillon and Canisius. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> was not satisfied, nor were the party of reform, that the two protagonists of former convocations were absent; Salmer&oacute;n, Lainez, and Polanco were straightway ordered by the Holy Father to go to <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> as his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Salmer&oacute;n* was the first to arrive. He spoke three hours on communion under one species. Lainez reached <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> in August, 1562. He was the first, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, to speak on the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were well under way, when the Fathers voted to allow him the whole of the next day for his discourse, which he delivered from a platform in the body of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The opinions of Lainez, not only in matters dogmatic but in the practice of refusing the cup to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, prevailed in the twenty second session.

<p>The matter of the next session was exceedingly delicate&mdash;the question of orders, involving as it did the origin of episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Lainez was one of the committee appointed to draw up the decrees and canons on the Sacrament of Orders; and to him the rest of the committee consigned that task. At the very outset of the discussions, the question of the Divine right of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came up; the discussions were carried on vigorously for nine months. Lainez stood firm for the Divine origin of the powers of the order of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the Divine right of the episcopal body to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and the conferring of this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> upon each individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> directly by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and not by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On two other occasions at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> Lainez defended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> origin of episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In the end the council left the mooted question out of the decrees of the Twenty-third Session. Lainez remained in the council until its adjournment (4 December, 1563). A little more than a year later (19 January, 1565), he died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/13029a.htm">Ribadeneira</a> (Vida del Padre Lainex, III, xvi), who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Lainez, says he was small of stature and delicate; his eyes were large, clear and full of life; his mind was quick and accurate; his character noble, deep, serious, large minded, firm, and strong. The chief published works of Lainez are "Disputationes Tridentinae", ed. Grisar, 2 vols. (Innsbruck, 1886); for long list of other works, see <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Nomenclator", and Sommervogel, "Bibliotheque de la Compagnie de J&eacute;sus" (Paris, 1893).
