<h1>James MacGeoghegan</h1>  

<p>Born at Uisneach, Westmeath, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1702; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1763. He came of a long <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> long settled in Westmeath and long holding a high position among the Leinster chiefs, and was related to that MacGeoghegan who so heroically defended the Castle of Dunboy against Carew, and also to Connell MacGeoghegan, who translated the Annals of Clonmacnoise. Early in the eighteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> were enacted and enforced against the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, except in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges, was rigorously proscribed. Young MacGeoghegan, therefore, went abroad, and received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> (then the Lombard) College in Parish, and in due course was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Then for five years he filled the position of vicar in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Possy, in the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a>, "attending in choir, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> and administering <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in a laudable and edifying manner". In 1734 he was elected one of the provisors of the Lombard College, and subsequently was attached to the church of St-Merri in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was also for some time <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> troops in the service of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and during these years he wrote a "History of Ireland". It was written in French and published at Parish in 1758. It was dedicated by the author to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brigade, and he is responsible for the interesting statement that for the fifty years following the Treaty of Limerick (1691) no less than 450,000 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers died in the service of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. MacGeoghegan's "History" is the fruit of much labour and research, though, on account of his residence abroad, he was necessarily shut out from access to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> materials of history in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and had to rely chiefly on Lynch and <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>. Mitchel's "History of Ireland" professes to be merely a continuation of MacGeoghegan, though Mitchel is throughout much more of a partisan than MacGeoghegan.
