<h1>James Robert Hope-Scott</h1>  

<p>(Originally H<font size=-2>OPE</font>)

<p>Parliamentary barrister, Q.C.; b. 15 July, 1812, at Great Marlow, Berkshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; d. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 29 April, 1873; third son of the Honourable Sir Alexander Hope, G.C.B., who was fourth son of John, second Earl of Hopetoun, a Scottish title <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1703. His mother was third and youngest daughter of George Brown of Ellerton, Roxburghshire. During early childhood his home was the Military College at <a href="../cathen/13436a.htm">Sandhurst</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was in command. Afterwards he went abroad with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, staying in succession at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, and Florence, and thus gaining a mastery of the German, French, and Italian tongues. In 1825 he entered Eton, whence, in 1828, he matriculated at Christ Church, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. After a visit to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1829 he went into residence at Oxford the same year. The <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">degree of B.A.</a> he took in 1832, coming out in the fourth class <em>in literis humanioribus</em>. Next year he was elected a Fellow of Merton. In 1835 he gave up his intention of entering the ministry of the Established Church, and began to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> under conveyancers, his call to the bar at the Inner Temple taking place in 1838. Meanwhile, in the latter year he graduated B.C.L. at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, proceeding D.C.L. in 1843. In 1838, after publishing anonymously in pamphlet form a letter to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, he saw through the press Gladstone's work entitled "The State considered in its Relations with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". Next year he and Roundell Palmer (the future Earl of Selborne) projected "The History of Colleges". In 1840, at <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> request, Hope wrote in "The British Critic", a review, later published separately, of Ward's translation of "The Statutes of Magdalen College, Oxon." The same year, as junior counsel for the capitular bodies petitioning against the Ecclesiastical Duties and Revenues Bill, he delivered the remarkably able speech which moved Brougham to exclaim, "That young man's fortune is made." In 1840, moreover, he was appointed Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Diocese of Salisbury</a>, which post he held until 1845. About the same time he took part in the foundation of Glenalmond College, in Perthshire, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the Scottish Episcopal youth. In 1840-41 he spent some eight months in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> included, in company with his close friend Edward Louth Badeley. On his return he became, with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, one of the foremost promoters of the Tractarian movement at Oxford. His next publication was a pamphlet against the establishment of the Anglo-Prussian <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> See of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, of which a second edition appeared in 1842. In 1849 and 1850 there came the Gorham trial and judgment, and in the latter year the agitation against the so-called "Papal Aggression". These events finally determined him upon the course of joining the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, into which, together with <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archdeacon Manning</a>, he was received in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1851 by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Brownhill.

<p>In 1852 he managed <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> defence in the <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a> action brought against him by Achilli, and in 1855 he conducted the negotiations which ended in <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> accepting the rectorship of the <a href="../cathen/15199b.htm">Catholic University of Ireland</a>. As to Hope's professional work, within a few years of his call he devoted himself wholly to parliamentary practice, in which his success and emoluments became prodigious. This was the palmy period of railway construction, and eventually he became standing counsel to almost every railway in the realm. In 1849 he was appointed Q.C., with a patent of precedence.

<p>His first wife, whom he married in 1847, was Charlotte Harriet Jane Lockhart, only daughter of John Gibson Lockhart and granddaughter of Sir Walter Scott. She soon followed her husband into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A year later he became tenant of Abbotsford to his brother-in-law, and on the latter's death, in 1853, its possessor in right of his wife, thereupon assuming the name of Hope-Scott. Not long afterwards he added a new wing to Sir Walter's mansion. In 1855 he bought the Highland estate of Dorlin, whereupon he built a new house, selling the whole to Lord Howard of Glosson in 1871. In 1858 he had to mourn the loss of his wife, who died in childbed, the newborn child dying shortly after, and Walter Michael, his infant son and heir, before the close of the year. His second wife, whom he wedded in 1861, was Lady Victoria Alexandrina Fitzalan-Howard, eldest daughter of the fourteenth Duke of Norfolk, of whose children Hope-Scott had been left guardian. In 1867 he had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a visit from Queen Victoria at Abbotsford, and in the same year he bought a villa at Hy&#232;res, in Provence. Like her predecessor, his second wife died in childbed in 1870, after giving birth to James Fitzalan Hope, now (1909) M.P. Hope- Scott never overcame the grief and shock entailed by this last bereavement. He now withdrew from his profession, surviving his dead wife but little more than two years, and dying in 1873. His funeral sermon was preached by his old and intimate friend <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church of Farm Street in which, two and twenty years back, Hope-Scott had made his submission to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His charities and benefactions were wellnigh boundless. It is reckoned that from 1860 onwards he spent &#163;40,000 in hidden charity. Among his innumerable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, he built at a cost of &#163;10,000 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at Galashiels, near Abbotsford, and he was the chief benefactor of St. Margaret's Convent, at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, wherein he lies buried.
