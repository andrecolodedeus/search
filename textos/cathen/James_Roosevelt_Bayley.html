<h1>James Roosevelt Bayley</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, U.S.A.; eighth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; b. at Rye, New York, 23 August, 1814; d. at <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, 3 October, 1877. His <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and English non-Catholic ancestors were locally notable. His father was the son of Dr. Richard Bayley, professor of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> in Columbia College, New York, and inaugurated the New York quarantine system. Mother Seton, foundress of the Sisters of Charity in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was his aunt. He was named after his maternal grandfather, James Roosevelt, a merchant of large fortune, who made him his heir, but altered the will when Bayley became a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, under the mistaken <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> could not possess <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. A large part of the money went to build the Roosevelt Hospital in New York. Bayley's early <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> days were spent at Amherst College, where he once thought of going to sea and obtained a commission of midshipman in the navy. He abandoned the plan, however, and continuing his studies, entered Trinity College, <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, to prepare for the Episcopalian ministry. He graduated here in 1835 and after receiving orders was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's church, Harlem, New York. He resigned this charge in 1841 and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where on 28 April, 1842, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in the room of St. Ignatius by Father Esmond, S.J. He then entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Sulpice at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. Returning to New York, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Hughes, 2 March, 1844, and made a professor and the vice-president of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>. He was acting president there in 1846 and was next given charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at the Quarantine Station on Staten Island, so long the residence of his grandfather, Dr. Bayley. Bishop Hughes then appointed him his private secretary, an office he held for several years and in which his administrative ability was specially manifested. He devoted some of his leisure to the collection and preservation of local historical data, much of which would otherwise have been lost. Part of this material he published in a small volume "A Brief Sketch of the Early History of the Catholic Church on the Island of New York" (New York, 1853; 2nd ed., 1870).

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a> was established he was named its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 30 October, 1853, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, by <a href="../cathen/02387a.htm">Archbishop Bedini</a>, the Apostolic Nuncio to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, who wan then <em>en route</em> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> and Burlington were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the same time, the first occurrence of such an elaborate <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Bishop Bayley's work of organizing the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was not easy. He had more than 40,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> mainly of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and German extraction, with only twenty-five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to minister to them. There was not a single <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institution, no funds, and poverty on all sides. He therefore applied for help to the Association of the Propagation of the Faith of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and to the Leopoldine Association of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and from both received material assistance. In a letter he wrote 10 April, 1865, reviewing the condition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> after his first ten years there he says: "I find that while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population has increased a third, the churches and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have doubled in number. In 1854 there was no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community. Now we have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, another of <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, a mother-house of Sisters of Charity, conducting seventeen different establishments; two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, two others of German Sisters of Notre Dame and two others of the <a href="../cathen/12257a.htm">Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis</a>. In 1854 there was no institution of learning; today we have a flourishing college and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, an academy for young ladies, a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attached to almost all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>." In addition to these he introduced the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a> into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and was one of the strongest upholders of the temperance movement of the seventies. He made several journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Holy Land, attending the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09744a.htm">Japanese martyrs</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1862; the centenary of the Apostles in 1867; and the Oecumenical Council in 1869.

<p>At the death of Archbishop Spalding of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> he was promoted, on 30 July, 1872, to succeed that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. He left Newark with much reluctance. In 1875 as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> he imposed the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> on Archbishop McCloskey of New York. In May, 1876, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the Baltimore <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, having freed it from <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. Convening the Eighth Provincial Synod of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, August, 1875, he enacted many salutary regulations, particularly with regard to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> dress, <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>. Illness <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to ask for a coadjutor and Bishop Gibbons of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> was appointed to that position 29 May, 1877. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> then went abroad to seek for relief, but in vain. He returned to his former home in Newark in August, 1877, and after lingering for two months, died in his old room, where he had laboured for so long. At his own request he was buried beside his aunt, Mother Seton, at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. He was a noble model of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Christian bishop</a>. He seemed animated with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the episcopal office and of kindness and charity to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. In conversation he once told <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Bishop Corrigan</a> that before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> he thought of becoming a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a>, but from both intentions his director dissuaded him. In addition to the volume on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on New York he wrote the "Memoirs of Simon Gabriel Brute, First Bishop of Vincennes" (New York, 1855).
