<h1>James Smith</h1>  

<p>Journalist, b. at Skolland, in the Shetland Isles, about 1790; d. Jan., 1866. He spent his boyhood at Skolland, a small place belonging to his mother, who was a member of a branch of the Bruce <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which had settled in Shetland in the sixteenth century. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, became a solicitor to the Supreme Court there, and married a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lady (a cousin of Bishop Macdonell of the Glengarry clan), the result being his own conversion to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Naturally hampered in his career, at that period, by his profession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, he turned his attention to literature, and became the pioneer of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. In 1832 he originated and edited the "Edinburgh Catholic Magazine", which appeared somewhat intermittently in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> until April, 1838, at which date Mr. Smith went to reside in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and the word "Edinburgh" was dropped from the title of the magazine, the publication of which was continued for some years in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Mr. Smith, on settling in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, inaugurated the "Catholic Directory" for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in succession to the old "Laity's Directory", and edited it for many years; and he was also for a short time editor of the "Dublin Review", in 1837. Possessed of considerable gifts both as a speaker and as a writer, he was always ready to put them at the service of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause; and during the years of agitation immediately preceding Catholic Emancipation, as well as at a later period, he was one of the most active champions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. He made a brilliant defence in public of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> when it was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked by certain prominent members of the <a href="../cathen/13627a.htm">Established Church of Scotland</a>, and published in this connexion, in 1831, his "Dialogues on the Catholic and Protestant Rules of Faith", between a member of the Protestant Reformation Society and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. He also edited (1838) Challoner's abridgment of Gother's "Papist Misrepresented and Represented", with copious notes. Mr. Smith was father of the Most Rev. William Smith, second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Andrews and Edinburgh in the restored <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and a distinguished Biblical scholar.
