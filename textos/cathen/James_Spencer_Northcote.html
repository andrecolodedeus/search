<h1>James Spencer Northcote</h1>  

<p>Born at Feniton Court, Devonshire, 26 May, 1821; d. at Stoke-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, 3 March, 1907. He was the second son of George Barons Northcote, a gentleman of an ancient Devonshire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Norman descent. Educated first at Ilmington Grammar School, he won in 1837 a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he came under <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> influence. In 1841 he became <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a>, and in the following year married his cousin, Susannah Spencer Ruscombe Poole. Taking <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a> in 1844 he accepted a curacy at Ilfracombe; but when his wife was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1845, he resigned his office. In 1846 he himself was converted, being received at Prior Park College, where he continued as a master for some time. From June, 1852, until September, 1854, he acted as editor of the "Rambler", and about the same time helped to edit the well-known "Clifton Tracts". After his wife's death in 1853 he devoted himself to preparation for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, first under <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> at Edgbaston, then at the Collegio Pio, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 29 July, 1855, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Stone, where his daughter had entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to complete his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, also acquiring the profound erudition in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities which was later to be enshrined in his great work "Roma Sotterranea". In 1857 he was appointed to the mission of Stoke-upon-Trent, which he served until 1860, when he was called to Oscott College as vice-president, and six months later became president. Under his rule, which lasted for seventeen years, the college entered on an unprecedented degree of prosperity, and his influence on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was felt far outside the walls of Oscott. Failing health <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to resign in 1876, and he returned to the mission, first at Stone (1868), and then at Stoke-upon-Trent (1881), where he spent the rest of his life revered by all for his learning, his noble character, and his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. During the last twenty years of his life he suffered form creeping paralysis, which slowly deprived him of all bodily motion, though leaving his mind intact. He had been made a canon of the <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Diocese of Birmingham</a> in 1861, canon-theologian in 1862, and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> in 1885. In 1861 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred on him the doctorate in divinity. Dr. Northcote's wide scholarship is witnessed to by many works, chief among which is "Roma Sotterranea", the great work on the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a>, written in conjunction with William R. Brownlow, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Clifton</a>. This work has been translated into French and German; and it won for its authors recognition as being among the greatest living authorities on the subject. Other works were: "The Fourfold Difficulty of Anglicanism" (Derby, 1846); "A Pilgrimage to La Salette" (London, 1852); "Roman Catacombs" (London, 1857); "Mary in the Gospels" (London, 1867); "Celebrated Sanctuaries of the Madonna" (London, 1868); "A Visit to the Roman Catacombs" (London, 1877); "Epitaphs of the Catacombs" (London, 1878).
