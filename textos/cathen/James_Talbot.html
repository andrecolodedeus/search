<h1>James Talbot</h1>  

<p>Fourth son of George Talbot and brother of the fourteenth Earl of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a> (b. 1726; d. 1790); chiefly known for having been the last <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be indicted in the public courts for saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> he was a great benefactor. In 1759, at the age of thirty-three, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Dr. Challoner</a>. During his episcopate he was twice brought to trial, on the information lodged by the well-known "Informer" Payne, in 1769 and 1771 respectively. In each case he was acquitted for want of evidence, but the judge, Lord Mansfield, was plainly on his side, in consequence of which, though he was no friend to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as such, his house was sacked during the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a> in 1780. On the death of <a href="../cathen/03564a.htm">Bishop Challoner</a> in 1781, Bishop James Talbot became <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the London District, which he ruled for nine years. He lived a retired life at Hammersmith, his unbounded charity gaining for him the title of "the Good Bishop Talbot". His chief work during these years was the completion of the purchase of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at Old Hall, Herts, where he had a preparatory academy which afterwards developed into <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal law</a> against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> still existed, and Bishop Talbot was again threatened with <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>; but he contrived to evade punishment. During the last years of his life the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee was already threatening trouble. In order to control it, Bishop Talbot allowed himself to be elected a member; but it was soon evident that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were beyond control. The crisis however had not yet arrived when Bishop Talbot died at his house at Hammersmith.
