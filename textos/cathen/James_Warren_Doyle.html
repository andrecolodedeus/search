<h1>James Warren Doyle</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; b. near New Ross, County Wexford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1786; d. at Carlow, 1834. He belonged to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, respectable but poor, and received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Clonleigh, at Rathconrogue, and later at the Augustinian College, New Ross. Shortly after 1800 he joined the Augustinian Order and was sent to Coimbra in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and there, at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, first manifested his great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers. In the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> he read everything, Voltaire and Rousseau among the rest. As a consequence his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> became unsettled; but his vigorous <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> soon asserted itself, and subsequently he became the fearless champion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which he was born. During the French invasion he did sentry work at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, and accompanied the English to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> as interpreter, and such was the impression he made at the Portuguese Court that he was offered high employment there. He declined the offer, however, and, returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1808, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the following year. Then for eight years he taught <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> at the Augustinian College, New Ross. In 1817 he became professor at Carlow College, and two years later the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/08637a.htm">Kildare and Leighlin</a> placed him <em>dignissimus</em> for the vacant see. Their choice was approved at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thus, in 1819, Doyle became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the effects of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> were still visible in the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Even the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as if despairing of equality and satisfied with subjection, often allowed <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bigotry to assail with impunity their country and creed. This attitude of timidity and acquiescence was little to Dr. Doyle's taste, and over the signature of "J. K. L." (James, Kildare and Leighlin) he vigorously repelled an attack made on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. He also published an extremely able pamphlet on the religious and civil principles of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and a series of letters on the state of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in which the iniquities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Establishment, the exactions of the landlords, the corrupt administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were lashed with an unsparing hand. The clearness of style, the skilful marshaling of facts, the wide range of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> astonished all. And not less remarkable was his examination before two Parliamentary committees in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Seeing his readiness and resource, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a> remarked that Doyle examined the committee rather than was examined by them. He joined the Catholic Association, and when O'Connell was about to contest Clare, Doyle addressed him a public letter hoping "that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> would be with him". After Emancipation these two great men frequently disagreed, but on the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> question they were in accord, and Doyle's exhortation to the people to hate <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> as much as they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> became a battle-cry, in the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Meantime nothing could exceed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He established confraternities, temperance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, built churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, conducted retreats, and ended many abuses which had survived the penal times. He also waged unsparing and incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>. He died young, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.
