<h1>James of Brescia</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a> of the fifteenth century. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, his native city, and in 1450 was appointed to the office of inquisitor. He aided the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> auditor, Bernardo da Bosco, in putting an end to the teaching of impious doctrines at <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>. He also took a prominent part in the controversy between the Dominicians and the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> with regard to the Precious Blood. During <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Week, 1462, <a href="../cathen/08278b.htm">St. James of the Marches</a>, a celebrated <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> preacher, maintained in a sermon at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> that the Blood separated from the Body of Christ during His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> was thereby separated from His Divinity, and consequently was not entitled to adoration during the time that Christ remained in the sepulchre. As this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had been proscribed by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> in 1351, James of Brescia cited <a href="../cathen/08278b.htm">James of the Marches</a> to appear before his tribunal in case he should not retract. A dispute at once arose between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. Shortly before, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> written at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> had declared that it was not contrary to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> to hold that Christ did not reassume <em>a part</em> of the Blood he shed in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. This declaration narrowed down the controversy to the question: Whether the Blood which Christ shed in His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <em>reassumed</em> at His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was adorable as the Blood of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> during the three days that it was separated from His Body. The affirmative was maintained by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the negative by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered a solemn disputation to be held before the pontifical court at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1462 (1463, according to many). James of Brescia was one of three <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who represented the Dominicians. Among the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> champions was Francesco della Rovere, later <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a>. After a debate of three days, a consultation was held by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, but no definitive decision was pronounced. In a Constitution <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 August, 1464, two weeks before his death, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius</a> forbade all further disputation on the subject. A full presentation of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> side of this controversy is preserved in an unpublished treatise written by James of Brescia and his two colleagues. Other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works attributed to James are no longer extant.
