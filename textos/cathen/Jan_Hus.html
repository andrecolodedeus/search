<h1>Jan Hus</h1>  

<p>(Also spelled <em>John</em>).

<p>Born at Husinetz in southern <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, 1369; died at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> 6 July, 1415.

<p>At an early age he went to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> where he supported himself by singing and serving in the churches. His conduct was exemplary and his devotion to study remarkable. In 1393 he received the degree of <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">Bachelor of Arts</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> and in 1396 the <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master's degree</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1400 and became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">university</a> 1402-03. About the same time he was appointed preacher in the newly erected Bethlehem <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Hus was a strong partisan on the side of the Czechs, and hence of the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Realists</a>, and he was greatly influenced by the writings of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>. Though forty five propositions of the latter were proscribed in 1403 by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, Hus translated <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif's</a> "Trialogus" into <a href="../cathen/04598b.htm">Czech</a> and helped to circulate it. From the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> he inveighed against the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">papacy</a>, thus taking an active part in the movement for reform. Archbishop Zbynek (Sbinco), however was not only lenient with Hus, but favoured him with an appointment as preacher to the biennial <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a>. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> directed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (24 June, 1405) to take measures against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teachings of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07694a.htm">impanation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> complied by issuing a synodal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> &#151; at the same time he forbade any further attacks on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the following year (1406) a document bearing the <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a> and eulogizing <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> was brought by two <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> students to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>; Hus read it in triumph from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. In 1408 Sbinco received a <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letter</a> from <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> stating that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had been informed of the spread of the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and especially of King Wenceslaus's sympathy with the sectaries. This stirred up the king to measures of prosecution and aroused the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">university</a> to clear itself of the suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. At the June <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> it was ordered that all writings of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> should be handed over to the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">archdiocesan chancery</a> for correction. Hus <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the order, declaring that he condemned whatever <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> these writings contained.

<p>About the same time a new conflict broke out on national lines. The king agreed to the "neutrality" plan proposed by the secessionist <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> and endeavoured to have it recognized by the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">university</a>. The Czechs fell in with his wishes but the three other "nations" refused. The king then decreed (18 January, 1409) that in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> congregations the Czechs should have three votes, and the other "nations" should have only one vote between them. In consequence the German masters and students in great numbers (5,000 to 20,000) left <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">Prague</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/09140a.htm">Leipzig</a>, Erfurt, and other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in the North. The king now forbade communication with <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and proceeded against those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who disregarded his prohibition. In consequence the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> placed <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> and the vicinity under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, a measure which cost many of the loyal <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> their position and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Hus, who had become once more <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">university</a>, was called to account by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for his <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffite</a> tendencies and was reported to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the result that <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 20 December 1409, directed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to forbid any preaching except in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">collegiate</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> churches, and to see that <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif's</a> writings were withdrawn from circulation. In accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at the June <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of 1410, ordered <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif's</a> writings to be <a href="../cathen/03519d.htm">burned</a> and restricted preaching to the churches named above. Against these measures Hus declaimed from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and, with his sympathizers in the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">university</a>, sent a protest to <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 16 July, 1410, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Hus and his adherents. Secure of the royal protection, Hus continued the agitation in favour of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, but at the end of August he was summoned to appear in person before the <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">pope</a>. He begged the <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">pope</a> to dispense with the personal visit and sent in his stead representatives to plead his case. In February 1411, <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was pronounced against him and published on 15 March in all the churches of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. This led to further difficulties between the king and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, in consequence of which the latter left <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> to take refuge with the <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> King <a href="../cathen/13784b.htm">Sigismund</a>. But he died on the journey, 23 September.

<p>Hus meanwhile openly defended <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, and this position he maintained especially against John Stokes, a licentiate of <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> and declared that in <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> was regarded as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. With no less vehemence Hus attacked the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> (9 September and 2 December 1411) in which <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> proclaimed <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to all who would supply funds for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against Ladislaus of Naples. Both Hus and Jerome of Prague aroused the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">university</a> and the populace against the <a href="../cathen/04164c.htm">papal commission</a> which had been sent to announce the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and its members in consequence were treated with every sort of indignity. The report of these doings led the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> authorities to take more vigorous action. Not only was the former <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against Hus reiterated, but his residence was placed under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Finally the <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">pope</a> ordered Hus to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and the Bethlehem <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> destroyed. The order was not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, but Hus towards the end of 1412 left <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> and took refuge at Austi in the south. Here he wrote his principal work, "De ecclesi&acirc;". As the king took no steps to carry out the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> edict, Hus was back again at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> by the end of April, 1414, and posted on the walls of the Bethlehem Chapel his treatise "De sex erroribus". Out of this and the "De ecclesi&acirc;" <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> extracted a number of propositions which he submitted to Archbishop Konrad von Vechta (formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>) with a warning against their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> character. In November following the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> assembled, and Hus, urged by <a href="../cathen/13784b.htm">King Sigismund</a>, decided to appear before that body and give an account of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. At <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> he was tried, condemned, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">burnt at the stake</a>, 6 July, 1415. The same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> befell Jerome of Prague 30 May, 1416. (For details see <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE</a>.)
