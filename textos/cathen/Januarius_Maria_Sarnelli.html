<h1>Januarius Maria Sarnelli</h1>  

<p>One of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">S. Alphonsus's</a> earliest companions, fourth son of Baron Angelo Sarnelli of Ciorani, b. in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> 12 Sept., 1702; d. 30 June, 1744. From his childhood he was remarkable for modesty, self-denial, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and great diligence in his studies. At the age of fourteen he desired to become a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> objected and directed him to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. He succeeded admirably in the legal profession, while daily Mass, visits to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and attendance on the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of incurables filled up all his spare time. At twenty-six he abandoned the bar and become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> showed itself at once in his labours for children, whom he catechized with wonderful success. Admirable instructions on this most important matter may be found in his works for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1732 and immediately became a member of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> devoted to Apostolic work. A year later he went to Scala and became one of the earliest companions of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">S. Alphonsus</a> in founding the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a>. Both these holy men worked together and gave missions along the coast of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> till 1735, when Ven. Sarnelli's health gave way. He had to return to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where he spent nine years in a poor apartment with one <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> as companion. Scarcely had his health improved than he began a crusade against the immorality of his time which has rarely been surpassed in boldness. In his writings he laid responsibility at the doors of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of state, while by his exhortations he created a public opinion which helped him on to success; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> evidently protected him in the dangers to which his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> exposed him. His triumph was complete. His labours amongst the lowly and abandoned were continual; yet he found time to write many excellent works. He will always be known for his insistence on meditation as morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for perseverance. He showed how simple it is and within the reach of everyone. It was his labours and success in this matter that occasioned, after the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> death, the Apostolic letter of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> then granted to meditation (16 Dec., 1746). A complete edition of Venerable Sarnelli's works have been published at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, Tipografia, Largo S. Martino, No. 4, as follows: Il Mondo Santificato, 2 vols.; L'Anima Illuminata; Il Mondo Reformato, 3 vols.; L'Ecclesiastico Santificato; Le Glorie e Grandezze della Divina Madre; Le Discrezione degli Spiriti; Il Cristiano Illuminato; Dirretto ed ammaestrato; Opera contra la Bestemmia; Ragioni Cattoliche, legali e politiche, in difesa della citta rovinata dall'insolentito meretricio; Il Cristiano Santificato; Lettere Spirituali; Devozioni pratiche per onorare la SS. Trinita e Maria e Devozioni per apparecchio ad una buona morte.

<p>He died in his forty-second year. His first biographer, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">S. Alphonsus</a>, writes: "As soon as he had breathed his last breath his countenance suddenly became beautiful &#151; and his body exhaled a sweet odour &#151; which remained in the room long after the interment." His body reposes in a side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> church in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He was declared Venerable in 1874. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on his <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a> was published in 1906, and now only <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are required for his Beatification.
