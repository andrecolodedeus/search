<h1>Japanese Martyrs</h1>  

<p>There is not in the whole <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a single people who can offer to the admiration of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world annals as <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> as lengthy, as those of the people of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. In January, 1552, <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> had remarked the proselytizing spirit of the early <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>. "I saw them", he wrote, "rejoicing in our successes, manifesting an ardent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to spread the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to win over to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> they conquered." He foresaw the obstacles that would block the progress of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in certain provinces, the absolutism of this or that <em>daimyo</em>, a class at that time very independent of the Mikado and in revolt against his supreme authority. As a matter of fact, in the province of Hirado, where he made a hundred converts, and where six years after him, 600 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in three days, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (the proto-martyr) was beheaded for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> before a cross. In 1561 the daimyo forced the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, "but they preferred to abandon all their possessions and live in the Bungo, poor with Christ, rather than rich without Him", wrote a missionary, 11 October, 1562. When, under the Shogunate of Yoshiaki, Ota Nobunaga, supported by Wada Koresama, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, had subdued the greater part of the provinces and had restored monarchical unity, there came to pass what <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> had hoped for. At Miyako (the modern Kiyoto) the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was recognized and a church built 15 Aug., 1576. Then the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> continued to spread without notable opposition, as the daimyos followed the lead of the Mikado (Ogimachi, 1558-1586) and Ota Nobunaga. The toleration or favor of the central authority brought about everywhere the extension of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and only a few isolated cases of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> are known (Le Catholicisme au Japon, I, 173).

<p>It was not until 1587, when there were 200,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, that an edict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or rather of prescription, was passed to the surprise of everyone, at the instigation of a bigoted <em>bonze</em>, Nichijoshonin, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the religion of his race. Twenty-six residences and 140 churches were destroyed; the missionaries were condemned to exile, but were clever enough to hide or scatter. They never <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the constancy of their converts; they assisted them in secret and in ten years there were 100,000 other converts in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. We read of two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, one at Takata, the other at Notsuhara; but very many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were dispossessed of their goods and reduced to poverty. The first bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> dates from 1597. It is attributed to two causes: (1) Four years earlier some <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> religious had come from the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> and, in spite of the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, had joined themselves to the 130 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who, on account of the delicate situation created by the edict were acting with great caution. In spite of every charitable advice given them, these men set to work in a very indiscreet manner, and violated the terms of the edict even in the capital itself; (2) a <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> vessel cast by the storm on the coast of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> was confiscated under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> then in vigour. Some artillery was found on board, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> susceptibilities were further excited by the lying tales of the pilot, so that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> went abroad that the Castilians were thinking of annexing the country. A list of all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Miyado and Osaka was made out, and on 5 Feb., 1597, 26 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, among whom were 6 Fransciscan missionaries, were crucified at <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a>. Among the 20 native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> there was one, a child of 13, and another of 12 years. "The astonishing fruit of the generous sacrifice of our 26 <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>" (wrote a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary) "is that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, recent converts and those of maturer <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, have been confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; they have firmly resolved to lay down their lives for the name of Christ. The very <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> were struck at seeing the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed ones as they suffered on their crosses and the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> with which they met death".

<p>Ten years before this another missionary had foreseen and predicted that "from the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, aided by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, it is to be expected that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> will inaugurate a race for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>". True it is that the national and religious customs of the people predisposed them to lay down their lives with singular fatalism; certain of their established usages, religious <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>, <em>hara-kiri</em>, had developed a contempt for death; but if grace does not destroy nature it exalts it, and their fervent charity and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Christ led the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to scourgings that the missionaries had to restrain. When this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Christ had grown strong in the midst of suffering freely chosen, it became easier for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to give the Saviour that greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by laying down their lives in a cruel death for His name's sake. "The fifty crosses, ordered for the holy mountain of <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a>, multiplied ten or a hundred fold, would not have sufficed" (wrote one missionary) "for all the faithful who longed for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>". Associations (<em>Kumi</em>) were formed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin with the object of preparing the members by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and scourgings even to blood, to be ready to lay down their lives for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 1597, there were isolated cases of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> until 1614, in all about 70. The reigns of Ieyasu, who is better known in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> annals by the name of Daifu Sama, and of his successors Hidetada and Iemitziu, were the more disastrous. We are not concerned now with the causes of that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which lasted half a century with some brief intervals of peace. According to Mr. Ernest Satow (quoted by Thurston in "The Month", March, 1905, "Japan and Christianity"): "As the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries conducted themselves with great tact, it is by no means improbable that they might have continued to make converts year by year until the great part of the nation had been brought over to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, had it not been for the rivalry of the missionaries of other orders." These were the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> religious; and hence the fear of seeing <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> spread its conquests from the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Furthermore the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of certain religious <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> was wanting in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and led to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.

<p>Year by year after 1614 the number of martyrdoms was 55, 15, 25, 62, 88, 15, 20. The year 1622 was particularly fruitful in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heroes. The <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> counts 128 with name, <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a> and place of execution. Before this the four <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustinians and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, had had their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but on 10 Sept., 1622, 9 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and 6 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay Christians</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at the stake after witnessing the beheading of about 30 of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. From December until the end of September, 1624, there were 285 <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The English captain, Richard Cocks (Calendar of State Papers: Colonial East Indies, 1617-1621, p. 357) "saw 55 <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Miako at one time. . .and among them little children 5 or 6 years old burned in their mother's arms, crying out: 'Jesus receive our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls'</a>. Many more are in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> who look hourly when they shall die, for very few turn <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>". We cannot go into the details of these horrible slaughters, the skilful tortures of Mount Unaen, the refined cruelty of the trench. After 1627 death grew more and more terrible for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; in 1627, 123 died, during the years that followed, 65, 79, and 198. Persecution went on unceasingly as long as there were missionaries, and the last of whom we learn were 5 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and 3 seculars, who suffered the torture of the trench from 25 to 31 March, 1643. The list of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> we know of (name, <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a>, and place of execution) has 1648 names. If we add to this group the groups we learn of from the missionaries, or later from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> travellers between 1649 and 1660, the total goes to 3125, and this does not include <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were banished, whose <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated, or who died in poverty. A <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> judge, Arai Hakuseki, bore witness about 1710, that at the close of the reign of Iemitzu (1650) "it was ordered that the converts should all lean on their own staff". At that time an immense number, from 200,000 to 300,000 perished. Without counting the members of <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Orders</a> and Congregations, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had, according to the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> (Delplace, II, 181-195; 263-275), 55 <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> 36, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> 38, the Augustinians 20. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> declared worthy of public cult 36 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, 25 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 21 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, 5 Augustinians and 107 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> victims. After 1632 it ceased to be possible to obtain reliable data or information which would lead to canonical <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>. When in 1854, Commodore Perry forced an entry to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, it was learned that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, after two centuries of intolerance, was not dead. In 1865, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the foreign Missions found 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> practising their religion in secret at Kiushu. Religious liberty was not granted them by <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> law until 1873. Up to that time in 20 provinces, 3404 had suffered for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in exile or in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; 660 of these had died, and 1981 returned to their homes. In 1858, 112 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, among whom were two chief-baptizers, were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by torture. One missionary calculates that in all 1200 died for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
