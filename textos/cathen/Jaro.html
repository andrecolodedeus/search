<h1>Jaro</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, formerly a part of the Diocese of Ceb&uacute;, was made a separate diocese on 27 May, 1865. It comprises the islands of Panay and Negros; the Romblon, Palawan, and Jolo groups, and in the island of Mindanao the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/15747a.htm">Zamboanga</a>, Cottabato, and Davao. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is over a million. Here and there throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are some Aglipayan schismatics, and in Mindanao and the Jolo group a large number of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> and some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. In 1909 there were forty-five native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, about forty <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> (Augustinians and Recollects), twenty Mill Hill missioners, and about ten <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In Jaro itself there is a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. Eighty of its students are preparing for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the rest for secular careers. In the city of Iloilo the Augustinians conduct a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for lay students. In the towns of Jaro, Iloilo, <a href="../cathen/15747a.htm">Zamboanga</a>, and Dumaguete are academies for young ladies, conducted respectively by Spanish and native Sisters of Charity, native Sisters of the Holy House of Mary, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> settlement of Culion, under government control, is attended by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and brothers, and by the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres</a>. The churches and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residences are generally large, solidly constructed stone buildings, Spanish in architecture. Many of them are very beautiful. Owing to the withdrawal of the Spanish <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> at the outbreak of the revolution against <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1898), and the present scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are still vacant. The native language, spoken throughout the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, is Visayan. But in the island of Mindanao the language spoken is a mixture of Spanish and several native dialects. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> classes, besides speaking their native dialect, also speak Spanish. Since the American occupation the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children are being taught English. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the centre of the sugar-growing industry, and the planters have always had a predilection for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and culture. Many of the most prominent Filipinos in professional, commercial, and political life are from these parts. Formerly the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>.

<p>Since 1898 an American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides over the diocese. The first was the Rt. Rev. Frederick Zadok Rooker, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 14 July, 1903, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; d. in 1907. Bishop Rooker was born in New York, 19 Sept., 1861, and made his first studies at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> and at <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">Union</a> College; later he entered the American College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and obtained in the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Theology. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1888, and acted as vice-rector of the American College from 1889 to 1894. In 1895 he became secretary of the Apostolic Delegation then recently established at Washington, and held that office until his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Jaro.
