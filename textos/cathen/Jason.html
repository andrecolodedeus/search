<h1>Jason</h1>  

<p>A Greek name adopted by many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> whose Hebrew designation was Joshua (Jesus). In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, it is applied to three or four persons connected with the period of the Machabees.
<h2 id="section1">Jason, the son of Eleazar</h2>

<p>In 161 B.C., he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a> to secure an alliance offensive and defensive (<a href="../bible/1ma008.htm#vrs17">1 Maccabees 8:17 sqq.</a>).
<h2 id="section2">Jason</h2>

<p>The father of the Antipater who was one of the ambassadors sent by Jonathan, in 144 B.C. to renew the former treaty with the Roman (<a href="../bible/1ma014.htm#vrs22">1 Maccabees 14:22</a>). This Jason is perhaps to be identified with Jason, the son of Eleazar.
<h2 id="section3">Jason of Cyrene</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> historian who lived in the second century B.C., and whose work is made know to us by the <a href="../bible/2ma000.htm">Second Book of Machabees</a>, which professes to be its direct "Epitome" (<a href="../bible/2ma002.htm#vrs24">2 Maccabees 2:24, 27, 32</a>). Jason's work, divided into five books, dealt, apparently in great detail, with the history of the Machabees and the wars of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against Antiochus Epiphanes, and his son Eupator (<a href="../bible/2ma002.htm#vrs20">2 Maccabees 2:20 sqq.</a>). In the "Epitome" five parts may still be distinguished, corresponding probably to the five books of Jason, and ending respectively with <a href="../bible/2ma003.htm#vrs40">3:40</a>; <a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#vrs42">7:42</a>; <a href="../bible/2ma010.htm#vrs9">10:9</a>; <a href="../bible/2ma013.htm#vrs26">13:26</a>; <a href="../bible/2ma015.htm#vrs37">15:37</a>. Jason composed his work in Greek, not long after 160 B.C., at which date the <a href="../bible/2ma001.htm">Second Book of the Machabees</a> closes its narrative. He was thus contemporary with the events which he chronicled.
<h2 id="section4">Jason, the high-priest</h2>

<p>This unworthy son of Simon the Just purchased at great price from Antiochus Epiphanes the deposition of his brother <a href="../cathen/11253b.htm">Onias III</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priesthood</a>. During the three years of his own pontificate, he did all in his power to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the youth of Jerusalem (<a href="../bible/2ma004.htm#vrs7">2 Maccabees 4:7-17</a>). On the occasion of the games celebrated at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, in honour of Hercules, he sent a Jewish deputation with a large sum of money which he intended to be spent on <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; at the request of his envoys, however, it was devoted to building galleys. He was finally supplanted by Menelaus, his own envoy to Antichus, took refuge among the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a> (<a href="../bible/2ma004.htm#vrs23">2 Maccabees 4:23-26</a>), captured Jerusalem next year, but had to soon flee again among the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonites</a>, wandered in different places, and ultimately died miserably at <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a>.
