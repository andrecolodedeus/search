<h1>Jean-Allarmet de Brogny</h1>  

<p>(Or JEAN-ALOUZIER).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. in 1342 at Brogny, in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1426. Biographers are not agreed as to his parentage and real name. According to some, he belonged to a peasant <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Broguy, called Allarmet; others say he was descended from the d'Alouzier, a noble house in Comtat-Venaissin. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that the future <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was a swineherd, when two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, struck by his open disposition and thoughtful answers, took him with them to Geneva, and procured for him an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which was completed at the <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">University of Avignon</a>. Despite the friendship and the inducement of Marcossay, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, young Allarmet retired to the Chartreuse of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, where his merits soon became widely known. When <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Robert of Geneva</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the faction hostile to <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, Allarmet joined him at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, either having been sent by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> or called by Robert himself.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> favors were bestowed upon him in quick succession by the so-called <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>; the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Viviers</a>, in 1380, the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, in 1385, and shortly after, the exalted office of Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Robert's successor, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Peter of Luna</a>, who called himself Benedict XIII, sanctioned all these preferments and even promoted Allarmet from <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Viviers</a> to Ostia-Velletri, one of the suburbican <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that at that time Cardinal de Brogny, like St. Peter of Luxemburg and St. Vincent Ferrer, considered the French obedience as legitimate. However, his thorough <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> soon <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to change his views. As early as 1398 he had left <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> as a silent protest against the unapostolic spirit of that court. The elusive tactics of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> were met by him with more than a silent protest. He inaugurated the neutral party and brought about the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> which resulted in the election of <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> (1409).

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed de Brogny in his double dignity of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the latter capacity he presided over Alexander's funeral and also over the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> (1410). <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John</a> held de Brogny in the highest esteem. The Metropolitan See of Arles having become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, he disregarded the candidate elected by the Arlesian chapter and appointed Cardinal de Brogny perpetual administrator of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This appointment was intended as a means of recovering the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arles usurped by the Counts of Provence during the confusion consequent on the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> did not disappoint his patron. With the might of right he fought the usurpers till the last claim of the venerable see was secured. Cardinal de Brogny then left his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in care of the two Fabri and proceeded on a still more delicate mission. Owing to the obstinacy of the contestants, the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> had really left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> instead of one. Moreover, to the evils of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> was adding that of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> was convened to meet this double difficulty, and after the withdrawal of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, de Brogny, in virtue of his title of Chancellor, presided over the sessions of the Council and evinced sterling qualities.

<p>In behalf of unity, he did not hesitate to vote for the deposition of the three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, two of whom had been his personal friends. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he could have secured the election for himself, had he so desired; but he threw the weight of his influence in favor of Colonna, who took the name of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. If <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> remained contumacious and was condemned, it was not de Brogny's fault. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Senebier writes in his "Histoire litterairede Geneve": "In the letters of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> we find a conversation with the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> [de Brogny] who endeavored to conquer him by such arguments as compassion, meekness, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> suggested ".

<p>In his old age de Brogny asked to be translated from <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> to Geneva, but only his remains reached the beloved place of his youth; they were laid to rest in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Machabees which had been added to the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> himself. De Brogny is variously known in history as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Viviers</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, sometimes <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Arles, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> de Saluces. He founded the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a> and Annecy; the maladrerie or <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers'</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, of Brogny; part of the <a href="../cathen/16020a.htm">Celestines'</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; and, above all the College of St. Nicholas, affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">University of Avignon</a>, and endowed with twenty scholarships for destitute students. Soulavie, president of St. Nicholas College, published (Paris, 1774) a "Histoire de Jean d'Alouzier de Brogny" of which only fifty copies were printed.
