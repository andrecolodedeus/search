<h1>Jean-Antoine Nollet</h1>  

<p>Physicist, b. at Pimpr&eacute;, Oise, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 19 November, 1700; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 25 April, 1770. His peasant <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> sent him to study at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> and <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>. He went later to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to prepare for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In 1728 he received the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a> and applied immediately for permission to preach. Soon <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> became uppermost and together with Dufay and R&eacute;aumur he devoted himself to the study of physics and especially to research work in electricity. Abb&eacute; Nollet was the first to recognize the importance of sharp points on the conductors in the discharge of electricity. This was later applied practically in the construction of the lightning-rod. He also studied the conduction of electricity in tubes, in smoke, vapours, steam, the influence of electric charges on evaporation, vegetation, and animal life. His discovery of the osmosis of water through a bladder into alcohol was the starting-point of that branch of physics.

<p>In 1734 Nollet went to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and was admitted into the Royal Society. In 1735 he started in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at his own expense, a course in experimental physics which he continued until 1760. In 1738 Cardinal Fleury created a public chair of experimental physics for Nollet. In 1739 he entered the Academy of Sciences, becoming associate member in 1742, and pensionary in 1758. In April, 1739 the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> called him to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> to instruct the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and to furnish the instruments needed for the new chair of physics at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. After lecturing a short time at <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, he was called to Versailles to instruct the dauphin in experimental <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. He was appointed professor of experimental physics at the Royal College of Navarre, in 1753. In 1761 he taught at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of artillery at M&eacute;zi&egrave;res. Nollet was also a member of the Institute of Bologna and of the Academy of Sciences of Erfurt. He was calm and simple in manner, and his letters and papers showed that he had been devoted and generous to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and his native village. Nollet contributed to the "Recueil de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences" (1740-67) and the "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society"; his larger works include among others: &mdash; "Programme d'un cours de physique exp&eacute;rimentale" (Paris, 1738); "Le&ccedil;ons de physique exp&eacute;rimentale" (Paris, 1743); "Recherches sur les causes particuli&egrave;res des ph&eacute;nomenes &eacute;lectriques" (Paris, 1749); "L'art des exp&eacute;riences" (Paris, 1770).
