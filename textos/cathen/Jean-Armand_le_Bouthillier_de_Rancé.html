<h1>Jean-Armand le Bouthillier de Ranc&eacute;</h1>  

<p>Abbot and reformer of Notre Dame de la Trappe, second son of Denis Bouthillier, Lord of Ranc&eacute;, Councillor of State, etc., b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 9 Jan., 1626; d. at <a href="../cathen/09035a.htm">La Trappe</a>, 27 Oct., 1700. Originally intended for the Knights of Malta, the illness of his older brother caused his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to dedicate him to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> service, in order to preserve in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the former's numerous <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. On the death of his brother, 1637, he became Canon of Notre Dame de Paris, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of La Trappe, and of several other places, which gave him a revenue of about 15,000 <em>livres</em>. He early gave evidence of great precociousness in study, publishing, at the age of twelve years, an edition of Anacreon, with Greek notes, dedicated to his godfather, <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>. In 1651, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by his uncle, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. This dignity did not effect a change in his manner of life, which was worldly in the extreme. In 1652 his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died, leaving him a further increase in estate. At the age of twenty-six he was thus left absolutely his own master, handsome of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, polished and with practically unlimited wealth. Feasting and the pleasures of the chase, to which he was passionately attached, divided his time with preaching and other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> ministrations. His uncle, who desired him as coadjutor, made him <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be elected deputy of the second order to the General Assembly of the French Clergy in 1655, and had him appointed first <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Gaston, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, in 1656.

<p>For several years his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> reproached him for his <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> conduct, but he paid little heed to its voice. The death of the Duchess of Montbazon, in 1657, gave him the first serious thought leading to his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He retired to his Ch&#226;teau de Verets, where he gave himself to reflection on the vanities of life; put himself under capable direction, and began to live more in conformity with his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. In 1660 he assisted at the death of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, which made so great an impression on him that he said: "Either the Gospel deceives us, or this is the house of a reprobate" After having taken counsel, he disposed of all his possessions, except the Abbey of La Trappe, which he visited for the first time in 1662. He decided to become a religious, and obtained permission from the king, in 1663, to become its regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and reformer. After having passed through his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and made profession, he took formal possession of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as its regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and began the work of its reform, which, after he had overcome immense difficulties, was solidly established in his own <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, from whence it was adopted into numerous other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. His time and energy were so taken up with this work that, during the first year of his retirement he <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> himself to an entire separation from the world. He devoted his spare time to manual labour, and to the compilation of spiritual books. These latter were by no means inconsiderable. Amongst the most important are: "Vies de plusieurs solitaires de La Trappe"; "Le trait&eacute; de la saintet&eacute; et des devoirs de la vie monastique"; "La r&#232;gle de s. Beno&#238;t, traduite et explique selon son v&eacute;ritable esprit"; etc. His penitential mode of life made him many enemies, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be accused of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, but he refrained from defending himself, until finally, at the request of his most intimate friends, he wrote to the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Bellefonds, stating that he had signed the "Formula" (against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>) without restriction or reservation of any kind; adding that he had always submitted himself absolutely to those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had placed over him, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If this is considered insufficient to vindicate his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, the letters and pamphlets with which he attacked the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, as published by <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, are certainly enough to justify him from this charge. In 1695, feeling his health to be declining, he obtained permission from the king to resign his position, and for several years continued to give an example of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and resignation. His remains are <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at the Monastery of La Grande Trappe.
