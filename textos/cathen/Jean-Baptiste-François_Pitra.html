<h1>Jean-Baptiste-Fran&#231;ois Pitra</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, famous <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">archeologist</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 1 August, 1812, at Champforgeuil in the Department of Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. 9 Feb., 1889, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 13 December, 1836, and occupied the chair of rhetoric at the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> from 1836 to 1841. From his early youth he manifested indefatigable diligence which, combined with brilliant talents and a remarkable memory, made him one of the most learned men of his time. The first fruit of his scholarship was his decipherment, in 1839, of the fragments of a sepulchral monument, discovered in the cemetery of Saint-Pierre at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> and known as the "Inscription of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>". It probably dates back to the third century, was composed by a certain Pectorius and placed over the grave of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The initials of the first five verses of the eleven-line inscription form the symbolical word <a href="../cathen/06083a.htm"><em>&lsquo;ichth&uacute;s</em> (fish)</a>, and the whole inscription is a splendid testimony of the early <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayer for the dead</a>, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>, and life everlasting. He published the inscription in "Spicilegium Solesmense" (III, 554-64).

<p>In 1840 Pitra applied to <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Abbot Gu&eacute;ranger</a> of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> for admission into the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> order but, to accommodate the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, he remained another year as professor at the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>. He finally began his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> on 15 January, 1842, and made his profession on 10 February, 1843. A month later, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St-Germain in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. During his sojourn there he was one of the chief collaborators of Abb&eacute; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> in the latter's colossal "Cursus patrologi&aelig;". Pitra drew up the list of the authors whose writings were to find a place in the work, and collaborated in the edition of the Greek writers up to Photius, and of the Latin up to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. At the same time he contributed extensively to the newly founded periodical "Auxiliare catholique". In 1845 he had to break his connexion with the great work of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, owing to the financial difficulties of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of St-Germain, which finally had to be sold to satisfy the creditors. Pitra undertook a journey through Champagne, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Alsace, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the interests of his <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. At the same time he visited numerous <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> in these countries in search of unpublished <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> bearing on the history of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. The fruits of his researches he gave to the world in his famous "Spicilegium Solesmense" (see below).

<p>His many great arch&aelig;ological discoveries and his unusual acquaintances with whatever bore any relation to the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, induced <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to send him on a scientific mission to the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1858. Before setting out on his journey he studied the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> relative to Greek canon law, in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and other Italian cities. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, where he spent over seven months (July, 1859- March, 1860), he had free access to all the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of St. Petersburg and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. On his return he made an official visit of the twenty <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Galicia at the instance of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. After arranging his writings at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> and Ligug&eacute;, he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in August, 1861, to consult with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the advisability of erecting at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> a special department for Oriental affairs and to make a personal report on his findings in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Pitra was also chosen to supervise the new edition of the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, which was being prepared by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on 16 March, 1863, with the titular <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Thomas in Parione. As his residence he chose the palace of San Callisto where he continued to live the simple life of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> as far as his new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> permitted.

<p>On 23 Jan., 1869, he was appointed librarian of the Vatican. He drew up new and more liberal regulations for the use of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and facilitated in every way access of scholars to the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Above all, however, he himself made diligent researches among the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and published many rare and valuable specimens in his "Analecta" (see below). At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870, he ably maintained against the inopportunists that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Greek and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> upheld the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. After the accession of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (20 Feb., 1878) he supervised the edition of a catalogue of the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, of which the first volume, "Codices Palatini Gr&aelig;ci", appeared in 1885 and was prefaced by Cardinal Pitra with a laudatory epistle addressed to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. On 21 May, 1879, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a> and for five years laboured incessantly for the welfare of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which had been greatly neglected. On 24 Merch, 1884, he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12290a.htm">episcopal See of Porto and Santa Rufina</a> to which was annexed the dignity of subdean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. On 19 May, 1885, Abb&eacute; Brouwers published in the "Amstelbode", a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journal of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, a letter of Pitra, which the hostile press construed into an attack upon the policy of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>; but Pitra soon satisfied the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> of his filial devotion.

<p>Cardinal Pitra was one of the most learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Besides being Librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a> and member of various <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> commissions, he was cardinal protector of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of St. Cecilia at <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> and of Stanbrook in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of Christian Schools</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Charles</a> in <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, and the Sisters of the Atonement in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The following are his literary productions:&mdash;(1) "Histoire de Saint L&eacute;ger, &eacute;v&#234;que d'Autun et martyr, et de l'&eacute;glise des Francs au VII<sup>e</sup> si&#232;cle" (Paris, 1846), one of the most complete monographs on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> during the seventh century; (2) "La Hollande catholique" (Paris, 1850), consisting mostly of letters concerning <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and its people, which he wrote while travelling in that country in 1849; (3) "Etudes sur la collection des Actes des Saints par les RR. PP. J&eacute;suites Bollandistes" (Paris, 1850), a complete history of the "Acta Sanctorum" of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, preceded by a treatise on the hagiological collections up to the time of Rosweyde (d. 1629); (4) "Spicilegium Solesmense" (4 vols., Paris, 1852-1858), a collection of hitherto unpublished works of Greek and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and other early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers; (5) "Vie du P. Libermann" (Paris, 1855; 2nd ed., 1872; 3rd ed., 1882), a very reliable life of the <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Venerable Paul Libermann</a>, founder of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary. <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Libermann</a> had been a personal acquaintance of Pitra; (6) "Juris ecclesiastici Gr&aelig;corum historia et monumenta" (2 vols., Rome, 1864-8), containing the canonical writings of the Greeks from the so-called "Apostolic Constitutions" to the "Nomocanon", generally ascribed to Photius. With its learned introduction and its many notes and comments, the work forms a complete history of Byzantine law; (7) "Hymnographie de l'&eacute;glise grecque" (Rome, 1867), a dissertation on Greek hymnography, accompanied by numerous Greek <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul; (8) "Analecta sacra Spicilegio Solesmense". The first volume (Paris, 1876) contains Greek <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>; the second (Frascati, 1883), the third (Venice, 1883), and the fourth (Paris, 1883) contain writings of ante-Nicene Fathers; the fifth (Paris, 1888) is composed of writings of the Fathers and of a few <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; the seventh (Paris, 1891) contains writings bearing on the canon law of the Greeks and was published posthumously by Battandier, who had been Pitra's secretary; the eighth (Monte Cassino, 1881) contains the writings of <a href="../cathen/07351a.htm">St. Hildegard</a>; the sixth, which was to contain Greek melodies, has not been published; (9) "Analecta novissima" (2 vols., Frascati, 1885-8), a second supplement to "Spicilegium Solesmense". The first volume contains a French treatise on <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>, bullaria, catalogues of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> etc., and a hitherto unpublished treatise on <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> by Dom Constant. The second volume is devoted to writings of Odon d'Ourscamp, Odon de Ch&#226;teauroux, Jacques de Vitry, and Bertrand de la Tour, four <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>; (10) "Sancti Romani cantica sacra" (Rome, 1888), a collection of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> written by Romanos, the greatest Byzantine hymnodist. Pitra presented this work to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> jubilee. In addition to these works Pitra contributed numerous arch&aelig;ological, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, historical, and other articles to various scientific periodicals of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
