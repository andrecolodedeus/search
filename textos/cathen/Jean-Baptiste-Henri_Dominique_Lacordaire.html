<h1>Jean-Baptiste-Henri Dominique Lacordaire</h1>  

<p>The greatest <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator of the nineteenth century b. near <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, 13 May, 1802; d. at Sor&egrave;ze, 21 Nov., 1861. When he was only four years old he lost his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and was thenceforth under the care of his mother, "a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>" but no <em>d&eacute;vote. </em>She came of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of lawyers, and brought her son up for the bar. While still at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he lost his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. From Dijon he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to complete his legal studies under M. Guillemain. His first efforts at the bar attracted the attention of the great <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a>, who predicted for him a successful career as an advocate. Meantime, however, he regained his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and resolved to devote himself entirely to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Issy, 12 May, 1824, and in spite of the reluctance of the superiors, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Mgr de Qu&eacute;len, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 22 Sept., 1827. His first years in the ministry were spent as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and at the Coll&egrave;ge Henri IV. This work was little to his taste. Accordingly, when Mgr. Dubois, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York, visited <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1829 in search of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he found a ready volunteer in the young Abb&eacute; Lacordaire. All arrangements were complete, but before a start could be made the Revolution broke out (July, 1830). The <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Abb&eacute; de Lamennais</a>, at this time at the height of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as a defender of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> immediately offered him the post of collaborator in "L'Avenir", a newspaper intended to fight for the cause of "God and Freedom". The story of this famous journal belong to the article <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">LAMENNAIS</a>. Here it will be enough to mention that Lacordaire gladly accepted the offer, and abandoned his proposed journey to America. He and <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, whom he first met at the office of "L'Avenir", were the principal contributors. Thei programme was to renounce all State protection and assistance, and to demand religious freedom, not as a favour, but as a right. They advocated free speech and a free press, and exhorted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to avail themselves of these weapons in defence of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Their religious teaching was strongly Ultramontane. In the first sixteen numbers the leading article on seven occasions was from Lacordaire's pen. He did not write on abstract subjects; his line was to take some event of the day &#151; some insult to religion, some striking incident in the action of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in other countries, notably <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> &#151; and make this a text for the demand of religious <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. He possessed in a remarkable degree the qualities of a great journalist &#151; clearness, force, brilliancy, the power to discuss the graver topics of the day at short notice in limited space, and in a manner adapted to the general intelligence. Royalists and <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> alike were assailed with a power and fierceness never before exerted in the cause of religion. Even at this long interval of time it is impossible to read his articles without feeling keenly their strength and vividness. His contributions, and not those of <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, were the most aggressive.

<p>When the paper was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it was Lacordaire who suggested the appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and drew up the memoir to be presented to <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. But it was he, also, who was the first to recognize that their cause was lost, and that they must bow to the pontiff's decision. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at once, 15 March, 1832, though <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> and <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> remained for some months longer. The three met again at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and there, while at a banquet, they received the formal condemnation of the whole policy of "L'Avenir" (Encyclical "Mirari Vos", 15 Aug., 1832). On their return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Lacordaire went to stay at La Ch&ecirc;naie, in Brittany, where <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> had established a house of higher studies for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. He remained there for three months. It must be said, however, that the two men were at no time altogether cordial in their relations, and less than ever after their defeat. The system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> adopted by <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> was never accepted by his colleague, who also refused to pay the homage which was expected from the inmates of La Ch&ecirc;naie. But the main cause of the contention which arose was that Lacordaire's submission was sincere, whereas <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> continued to speak strongly against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Lacordaire left La Ch&ecirc;naie, 11 Dec., 1832, and returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was admitted to the circle of <a href="../cathen/14356a.htm">Madame Swetchine</a>, who exercised a restraining influence over him as long as she lived. As the press was no longer open to him, he began to give religious lectures <em>(conferences) </em>at the Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas (Jan., 1834). These were attended by some of the leading men of the day, but were soon denounced on account of the Liberal views expressed. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> intervened, and insisted that the lectures should be submitted beforehand to censors. The correspondence which ensued led to a complete change in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> attitude. He now offered Lacordaire the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre-Dame, and there, in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1835, the first of the famous conferences was delivered. Their success was astonishing from the very outset. The second series in the following year met with even greater favour. At the conclusion of these last conferences Lacordaire announced his intention of retiring from the world for a time, in order to devote himself to study and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. During a retreat at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> house of St. Eusebius in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he resolved to enter the religious state. Even in his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> days he had thought of becoming a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, but had been prevented by Mgr de Qu&eacute;len. He now decided to enter the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> whose name of "Friars Preachers" naturally appealed to him. Meantime he preached a course of conferences at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten season</a> of 1838, which were equally successful with those of Notre-Dame. His "M&eacute;moire pour le R&eacute;tablissement des Fr&egrave;res Pr&ecirc;cheurs" was preliminary to his reception of the habit at the Minerva in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (9 April, 1839). Next year he made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (12 April, 1840) and returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The first house of the restored order was established at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> in 1843, a second at Chalais in 1844; a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/06099b.htm">Flavigny</a> in 1848, and finally a French province was erected with Lacordaire as first provincial.



<p>Meantime, in the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> of 1843, the conferences were resumed at Notre-Dame, and continued with one break until 1852. At first King Louis Philippe endeavoured to prevent the resumption of the conferences, but the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/01180a.htm">Mgr Affre</a>, was firm, and merely required that the preacher should wear a canon's <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and <a href="../cathen/10624b.htm">mozetta</a> over his <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> habit. The interest in the conferences was greater than ever. It was noted that the orator had gained in depth and brilliancy by his years of retirement. And here it will be well to describe briefly the nature of the conferences and the causes of the extraordinary interest which they aroused. The old-fashioned sermon &#151; text, exordium, three points; and peroration &#151; dealt with dogmatic or moral subjects, and was addressed to believers. It reached its highest perfection at the hands of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the first part of the nineteenth century went on preaching as before, speaking of the same subjects bringing forward the same arguments, using the same methods; forgetting all the while that they had to appeal not only to believers but also to infidels. It was Lacordaire's merit that he discerned the necessity of a complete reform, new subjects, new arguments, new methods must be adopted. The matter must be apologetic, and, as <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> vary according to the nature of the enemy's assaults, it must be adapted to meet the attacks of the day. With the rare insight of genius, Lacordaire began where the ordinary <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> ends. He took the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as his starting-point, considering her as a great historical fact, and drawing from her existence, her long-continued duration, and her social and moral action the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her authority. Thus the first conferences in 1835 treated of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> constitution and her social activity. In the second course he went on to speak of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> viewed in their general aspect. When he resumed the conferences in 1843 he spoke of the effects of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, chastity, and other virtues), and upon <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Again, before treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he took Christ for the subject of the best known of all the series (1846). From the Son he passed to the Father (1848), proving the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and dealing with His work of creation. From <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he descended to man and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of man's Fall and Redemption (1849-50). The <em>coup d'&eacute;tat </em>prevented the continuance of the conferences in Notre-Dame, but a further course was delivered at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in 1854, treating of life, natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>.

<p>So much for the subjects. The form of the conferences was quite unlike that of the ordinary sermon. There was no opening text, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, no firstly, secondly, thirdly; no pause between the divisions. After a short exordium, indicating the subject to be dealt with, he plunged at once <em>in medias res</em>, and let his subject grow upon his hearers. His voice, feeble at the beginning, gradually grew in volume until it rang through the vast vault of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, sometimes breaking out into a cry which thrilled the hardest hearts. His gestures were grace&iacute;ul and yet full of vigour, his dark eyes flashed out the fire that was burning within him. His words were the choice of the moment, coming freely to his lips after careful preparation of the matter and the main lines of his discourse; indeed, his most brilliant passages were inspired by some movement among his audience, or some sudden emotion within himself. We can understand the state of prostration produced by such delivery, and how his strenuous efforts tended to shorten his life.

<p>The government of Louis Philippe came to an ignominious end in Feb., 1848. In his opening conference of that year, delivered while the barricades were still standing, Lacordaire welcomed the Revolution in language which was greeted with prolonged applause. Now at last he hoped to carry out his old programme of "God and Freedom" &#151; without the youthful excesses that marred the policy of "L'Avenir". A new paper, "L'Ere Nouvelle", was started under his editorship, but he wrote little in its columns. He realized that his strength lay rather in speech than in writing. In the elections he accepted a <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but obtained only a small number of votes. He was, however, returned for the department of Bouches-du-Rh&ocirc;ne. He took his seat on the Extreme Left, clad though he was in his <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> habit. A few benches below him sat his former friend and master, now his bitter foe, <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>. The invasion of the Assembly by the rabble convinced him that his dream of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> republic was not to be accomplished. He resigned his seat 18 May, and some months later gave up the editorship of "L'Ere Nouvelle". He did his utmost to prevent the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from becoming identified with the Empire established by <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>. For this reason he refused to continue his conferences in 1852, though urged to do so by <a href="../cathen/13769a.htm">Mgr Sibour</a>. His last discourse in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was delivered in the church of Saint-Roch in 1853. It was a sermon on the text: "Esto vir" (<a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#vrs2">1 Kings 2:2</a>), and was an outspoken attack on the new Government. After, this it was impossible for him to remain in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. For the rest of his life he had charge of the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Sor&egrave;ze, in the department of Tarn, where he inculcated the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of manliness and patriotism as well as religion. Though he was devoted to his youthful pupils he naturally felt that he was exiled and silenced. In 1861 (24 Jan.) he was called out of his obscurity to take his seat in the Academy &#151; an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which cast a gleam of brightness over his last days. It was at this time that he uttered the famous words: "J'esp&egrave;re mourir en religieus p&eacute;nitent et en lib&eacute;ral imp&eacute;nitent." Towards the end of the year (21 Nov.) he passed away at Sor&egrave;ze, after a long and painful illness, in his sixtieth year.

<p>Lacordaire was of middle height, sparely but strongly built. He always objected to sit for his portrait, but one day at Sor&egrave;ze he submitted. He is represented seated, and absorbed in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, with his hands crossed one over the other, for the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> bell was ringing in the church when the portrait was taken.

<p>Besides his "Eloges fun&egrave;bres" (Drouot, O'Connell, and Mgr Forbin-Janson) he published: "Lettre sur gSaint-Si&egrave;ge"; "Consid&eacute;rations sur le syst&egrave;me philosophique de M.de Lamennais"; "De la libert&eacute; d'Italie et de l'&Eacute;glise", "Vie de S. Dominique"; "Sainte Marie Madeleine" (the two last-mentioned works contain many sublime passages, but are of little historical value). Mme Swetchune said of him: "On ne le conna&iacute;tra que par ses lettres." Eight volumes of these have already been published, including his correspondence with <a href="../cathen/14356a.htm">Mme Swetchine</a> and Mme de la Tour du Pin, and "Lettres &agrave; des Jeunes Gens", collected and edited by his friend <a href="../cathen/11702a.htm">H. Perreyve</a> in 1862 (tr. Derby, 1864; revised and enlarged ed. London, 1902). Amongst Lacordaire's most celebrated works are his "Conferences" (tr. vol. I only, London, 1851), "Dieu et l'homme" in "Conf&eacute;rences de Notre Dame de Paris" (tr. London, 1872); "J&eacute;sus-Christ" (tr. London, 1869), "Dieu" (tr. London, 1870).
