<h1>Jean-Baptiste-Julien D'Omalius Halloy</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> geologist, b. at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 16 February, 1783; d. at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 15 January, 1875. He was the only son of an ancient and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was carefully directed. After completing his classical studies he was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1801 by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to avail himself of the social and literary advantages of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. A lively interest, however, in natural history awakened by the works of Buffon, directed his steps to the museums and the Jardin des Plantes. He visited <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> again in 1803 and 1805, and during these periods attended the lectures of Fourcroy, Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de, and Cuvier. His homeward journeys were usually made the occasion of a geological expedition through northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He thus conceived the project of making a series of surveys throughout the whole country. This was furthered by a commission to execute a geological map of the empire which brought with it exemption from military <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. He devoted himself energetically to the work and by 1813 had traversed over 15,500 miles in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and portions of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had, however, but little sympathy with his geological activity, and persuaded him about this time to gave up his expeditions. The map which he had made of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the neighbouring territories was not published until 1822 and served as a basis for the more detailed surveys of Dufr&eacute;noy and <a href="../cathen/05385b.htm">Elie de Beaumont</a>. After having served as sous-intendant of the arrondissement of Dinant and general secretary of the province of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, he became in 1815 governor of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>. He held this office until after the Revolution of 1830. He was elected a member of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Senate in 1848, became its vice-president in 1851, was made a member of the Academy of Brussels in 1816, and was elected its president in 1850.

<p>As a statesman Halloy had at heart the well-being of the people and, though his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> allowed him little opportunity for extended geological research, he retained a lively interest in his favourite <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and engaged occasionally in field work. In his later years he gave much attention to questions of ethnology and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. His death was hastened by the exertions of a scientific expedition undertaken alone in his nine-first year.

<p>Halloy was one of the pioneers of modern geology, and in particular laid the foundation of geological <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> over wide areas. He made important studies in the carboniferous districts of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and the Rhine provinces and in the Tertiary deposits of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> basin. He was a practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> during his long and active life, and was characterized by his loyalty and devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He insisted on the harmony between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, making this the subject of his oration on the occassion of the golden jubilee of the Belgian Academy in 1866. Among his published works are: "Description g&eacute;ologique des Pays-Bas" (1828); "El&eacute;ments de G&eacute;ologie" (1831); "Introduction &agrave; la G&eacute;ologie" (1833); "Coup d'oeil sur la g&eacute;ologie de la Belgique" (1842); "Precis elementaire de G&eacute;ologie" (1843); "Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de G&eacute;ologie" (1853); "Des Races humaines ou El&eacute;ments d' Ethnographie" (1845).
