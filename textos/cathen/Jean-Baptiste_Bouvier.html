<h1>Jean-Baptiste Bouvier</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, b. At St. Charles-la-For&ecirc;t, Mayenne, 16 January, 1783; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 December, 1854. Having received merely an elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he learned his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> trade of carpentry, but he gave his spare time to the study of the classics under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1805 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Angers, where he made rapid progress. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1808 and appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the College of Ch&acirc;teau Gonthier. In 1811 he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, where he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. In 1819 he was made superior of that institution and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, a position which he held until 1834, when he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>. The influence exerted by his "Institutiones Theologic&aelig;" (in fifteen editions), which was in use in almost all the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, gives Bishop Bouvier a unique and honourable position in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> during the nineteenth century. His compendium had the distinction of being the first manual, and for many years the only one well adapted to that period of transition (1830-70), marked on the one hand by the death struggles of Gallicanism and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and on the other by the work of reform undertaken by all departments of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning.

<p>At first, Bishop Bouvier published separate <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises, which formed a collection of thirteen volumes (1818-33), reduced in 1834 to six, and published in that form until 1852. The author endeavoured to improve his work in the successive editions, but his failure to remove from it all traces of Gallicanism provoked criticism. A Gallican, through prejudices derived from his early training rather than from personal conviction, Bouvier readily consented to submit his work to the corrections of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> appointed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. Their revision resulted in the eighth edition (1853). After the death of Bouvier, the professors of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> eliminated many imperfections which had been overlooked by the revisers of 1853. The manual was shortly afterwards adopted in more than sixty <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Bouvier's treatment of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> is remarkable; he took a decided stand against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and adopted the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>; though even this reaction against rigorism did not bring his work up to the standard of the manuals of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of the present time.

<p>Some critics condemned much of the information in the "Institutiones" as a crude and confused mass, irrelevant, and only indirectly connected with <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. It must be recalled, however, that Bishop Bouvier did not enjoy the advantages of the present day, when the various branches of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> study are classified, and each given its proper place. Notwithstanding the incompleteness of preparatory studies eighty years ago, the scarcity of vocations, the urgent need of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and limited pecuniary resources made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to limit the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> course to three years and, at the same time, to include in the curriculum all the studies <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the exercise of the sacred ministry in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Under such circumstances it was impossible to observe nice distinctions in the classification of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. However, in spite of defects, the "Institutiones Theologic&aelig;" will stand as a signal achievement on the morrow of the Revolution. The Bishop gradually brought the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and lethargy of the preceding chaotic age, and prepared for the reforms of the latter part of the nineteenth century. Like <a href="../cathen/06684b.htm">Cardinal Gousset</a> he must be regarded as one of the foremost reformers of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> conceived the highest esteem for him and invited him to be present at the definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception.
