<h1>Jean-Baptiste Corneille</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, etcher, and engraver, b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> between 1646 and 1649; d. there, 12 April, 1695. He was the youngest son of <a href="../cathen/04374a.htm">Michel Corneille</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and brother of the <a href="../cathen/04373d.htm">younger Michel</a>. He is known as "the younger, Corneille". His devoted father was his teacher and painstakingly prepared the youth for his future successes as an historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. In 1664 he won the second prize and in 1668 the first prize of the academy. He then went to study in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, on his return in 1675 was received into the Royal Academy, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> for his reception-picture the "Punishment of <a href="../cathen/03087a.htm">Busiris</a> by Hercules", now one of the notable canvases in the Louvre. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in some of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> churches and in 1679 finished his "Deliverance of St. Peter from Prison" for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre-Dame. With Jacques Vouet he was employed on the decorations of the Tuileries. In 1692 he was appointed professor in the academy.

<p>His style, like his brother's, was that of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Desiderosi, but Jean was somewhat inferior to the younger Michel in composition and drawing. Many of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of this excellent artist were engraved by contemporaries, a few by the great Mariette, and Jean himself engraved and etched plates after his own designs and finished pictures, and after the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a>. His work with acid and the burin was spirited and exhibited his thorough mastery of technic. He commenced and finished his plates after the manner of <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Agostino Carracci</a>. His most important plates were: "Bust of Michelangelo", "St. Bernard", "Mercury in the Air", and "St. John in the Wilderness" (after <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>).
