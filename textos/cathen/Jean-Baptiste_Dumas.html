<h1>Jean-Baptiste Dumas</h1>  

<p>Distinguished French chemist and senator, b. at Alais, department of Gard, 14 July, 1800; d. at Cannes, 10 April, 1884. Like many other distinguished chemists, Dumas began his career as a pharmacist, and at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, where he went when a very young man, he obtained a position in the Le Royer pharmacy. Here in connexion with Pr&eacute;vost he published a memoir on the physiology of the nervous system which attracted attention and is still well known. This led to an invitation to go to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he became tutor of <a href="../cathen/14566d.htm">Th&eacute;nard's</a> course of lectures in chemistry at the Ecole Polytechnique and was appointed professor at the Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e. While engaged in these positions his published researches concerning the vapour density of the elements, those on the formul&aelig; of alcohols and ethers, his memoirs on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of substitution in organic compounds, and his work on chemical types gave him an illustrious position in chemical investigation. The first researches on the replacing of hydrogen by chlorine in organic bodies is due to him; this was supplemented by researches as to the atomic weight of carbon, his labours doing much to establish the relations of the hydro-carbon compounds in organic chemistry. With Boussingault he studied the composition of water and of the atmosphere. With Stas he investigated the composition of carbon dioxide, and later his memoirs on hydrogen and the amide compounds brought him at once into the first rank among the chemists of the nineteenth century.

<p>In 1829 he founded the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures with P&eacute;clet, Lavalli&eacute;, and Olivier. Brilliant lecture courses in the Sorbonne won him further renown. He replaced <a href="../cathen/14566d.htm">Th&eacute;nard</a> as professor at the Ecole Polytechnique, was professor at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> and dean of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Originally a very poor speaker, by practice and study he acquired elocutionary powers that brought him great celebrity. Dumas also became professor at the Ecole de M&eacute;decine, a position he resigned in favour of Wurtz, one of his most distinguished pupils. His scholars included such illustrious men as H. Sainte-Claire Deville, Wurtz, Debray, <a href="../cathen/11536a.htm">Pasteur</a>, and others. Turning his attention to politics, Dumas was elected a deputy from the department of Nord in 1849; among the proposed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in which he was interested were various ones treating the recoining of money, stamped paper, <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of public acts, taxes on salt, sugar, etc. In 1851 he was appointed minister of agriculture and commerce by <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Louis Napol&eacute;on</a>, and after the <em>coup d'etat</em> was made senator. From 1832 he was a member of the Institute, being elected to the Academy of Sciences, and in 1868 he was made a perpetual secretary; in 1878 he became a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>. In 1858-59 he carried on an animated controversy as to the nature of the elements with <a href="../cathen/04755b.htm">Despretz</a>; in the course of the discussion Dumas' energetic methods in attacking his opponent's views excited some criticism. His abandonment of chemical research for politics was considered a misfortune by the scientific world, as he ceased his brilliant investigations when in the very prime of his powers.

<p>Dumas was a consistent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and remained true to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> all his life. When it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he never hesitated to defend <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against the attacks of materialism. Examples of his views in this regard may be found in his various addresses, as: his address on B&eacute;rard; his commemorative address on Farady, and the speech in which he extended the greetings of the Academy to the historian Taine. The Count d'Haussonville, at the funeral of Dumas, gave eloquent testimony to the latter's religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Dumas was a prolific writer. Among his works may be mentioned: "Trait&eacute; de chimie appliqu&eacute;e aux arts" (8 vols., 1828-45); "Pr&eacute;cis de chimie physiologique et m&eacute;dicale"; "Le&ccedil;ons sur la philosophie chimique" (1837); "Essai de statique chimique des &ecirc;tres organs&eacute;s" (1841), the last work written in collaboration with Boussingault. Besides the publications just mentioned there were numerous papers in scientific journals and in the transactions of the Academy of Sciences. A list of his papers was published in the "Catalogue of Scientific Papers of Royal Society, London".
