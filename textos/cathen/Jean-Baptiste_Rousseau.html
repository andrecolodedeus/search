<h1>Jean-Baptiste Rousseau</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> poet, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 16 April 1670; d. at La Genette, near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 17 May, 1741. Although he was the son of a shoemaker, he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> with the greatest care and made his studies at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of Louis le Grand, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On account of his wit, he was admitted to the most exclusive <em>salons</em>. After a short sojourn in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, as private secretary to the French ambassador, Tallard, be frequented the irreligious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which gathered at the Temple, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence of which caused his misfortunes. His first dramatic attempts were failures, but his epigrams gained him a great reputation. He was elected to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in 1700. "Couplets inf&#226;mes", a <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a> of a most licentious character. Having retorted that they had been written by Saurin, he was sentenced by the Parliament to pay four thousand <em>livres</em> damages to Saurin, and soon after sent to exile. He went first to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where he was sheltered by the French ambassador, Count de Luc, then to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, to Prince Eug&#232;ne's Court, and finally to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. He tried several times to have the court's decision annulled, but failed because of the hostility of Voltaire and a few others. His works consist of: (1) a comedy in prose, "Le caf&eacute;" (1694), two operas, "Jason" (1696) and "V&eacute;nus et Adonis" (1697), and five comedies in verse, only two of which were produced on the stage, "Le flatteur" (1696) and "Le capricieux" (1700); (2) four books of odes, the first being an adaptation of the Psalms, two books of allegories and a score of cantatas; (3) his epigrams, the best part of his work, which will secure his fame; (4) his letters. His works were repeatedly reprinted from 1710 to 1820. His lyrics are not esteemed now, but he is still regarded as the greatest epigrammatist of the eighteenth century.
