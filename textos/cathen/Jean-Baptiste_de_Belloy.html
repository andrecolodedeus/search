<h1>Jean-Baptiste de Belloy</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>-<a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, b. 9 October, 1709, at Morangles in the <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Diocese of Beauvais</a>; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 10 June, 1808. Although of an ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of no mean military fame, young Belloy preferred an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, made his classical and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and received the degree of Doctor in Theology in 1737. In the ministry he shone more by his virtue than by his learning. Sweetness of character, enlightened and moderate <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, unswerving fidelity to the principles and traditions of the church, characterized him through life, and rendered even his early ministry remarkably fruitful. His <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Cardinal de Gevres, appointed him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1751 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Glandeves. At the famous Assembly of the French Clergy of 1755, he took sides with the moderate party and contributed to the restoration of tranquillity in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Dissensions occasioned by the bull <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> had become so great in the <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Diocese of Marseilles</a> that, at the death of the saintly <a href="../cathen/02425c.htm">Bishop de Belsunce</a>, there was imminent danger of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In this emergency a chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of consummate <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and tact was needed, and Bishop de Belloy was accordingly transferred to that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Without sacrifice of principle or <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, by gentleness, tact, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he gained the confidence of both parties and restored peace. In July, 1790, the National Assembly decreed the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Diocese of Marseilles</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> withdrew, but sent to the assembly a letter of protest against the suppression of one of the oldest <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He retired to Chambly, a little town near his native place, where he remained during the most critical period of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. When, in 1801, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> decided that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should tender their resignation in order to facilitate the conclusion of the Concordat, he was the first to comply, setting the example which exercised great influence over the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, highly pleased with this act of devotion to <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, appointed the nonagenarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the See of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Notwithstanding his extreme age he governed his new diocese with astonishing vigour and intelligence, reorganized the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, provided them with good <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and visited his flock in person. He restored the <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">Crown of Thorns</a> (10 August, 1806) to its place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the Sainte Chapelle. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> was so well satisfied that he asked and readily obtained for him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, which <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> placed on the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> venerable head in a consistory held in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1 February, 1805. At his death Cardinal de Belloy had spent seventy-five years in the holy ministry to the edification of all and the evident satisfaction of both <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, then engaged in deadly conflict. He is buried in Notre Dame, Paris, where the monument erected by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is one of the finest in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
