<h1>Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Vallier</h1>  

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, b. at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 14 Nov. 1653; d. at Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 26 Dec., 1727; son of Jean de La Croix de Chevri&egrave;res, and Marie de Sayne. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the local <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and took the degree of Doctor of Theology at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> at the age of nineteen. While acting as almoner to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> his regularity and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> not only preserved him from the dangers of the Court, but maintained and redeemed others, who were edified by his charity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> toward the poor and infirm. He accompanied the king in a campaign to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and devotedly attended the wounded and dying. Through <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> he successively refused the Sees of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, preferring a field of missionary labor and hardship. He was chosen to replace Bishop Laval on his resignation (1684), and pending the reception of his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, he left for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1685). At first his bearing towards the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the other institutions showed a disposition to continue his predecessor's policy. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> moved him to visit every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> between Quebec and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and even distant Acadia. Under the title "Etat pr&eacute;sent de l'&Eacute;glise et de la colonie de la Nouvelle-France" (Paris, 1687), he published a glowing account of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and devotedness of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and of the morality of the people. The contrast between Laval's paternal rule, and St-Vallier's often untimely <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and anxiety to reform caused apprehension. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (1688) promoted the king's liberality in behalf of the incipient Church and the propagation of the Faith. The young <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor's</a> activity spent itself in creating <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, building churches, and founding homes for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, beginning with "La Providence (1689), which was to develop into the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> (1692). In 1689 he visited Newfoundland and founded at Placentia a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. When Phipps (1690) besieged Quebec, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> hastened back from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> to comfort his flock, and published for the occasion a <em>mandement</em> full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and patriotism. In 1692, to Laval's displeasure, he altered the system of joint administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>In 1694 St-Vallier went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the third time to exonerate himself from the charges brought against him. In spite of the king's desire to retain him, he returned to Quebec (1697), and finished constructing his spacious palace, destined to give hospitality to all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. That same year, he founded at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, who combined <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work with teaching. He likewise approved the charitable foundation of the Charron Brothers, which lasted till 1745. In 1689, he had summoned to Quebec the Sisters of Marguerite Bourgeoys who still teach there. He encouraged the extension of the Faith by confiding to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the Illinois, Miami, <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>, and Ottawa missions; Ile Royale to the Recollects, and the Tamarois mission, on the left bank of the Mississippi, to the Quebec <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1698), one of whose missionaries represented Mgr SaintVallier as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for the Louisiana region, then comprised, as well as all the vast territory included in the future "Louisiana Purchase", within the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec. He visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1701), and on his return voyage was captured by the English. During his five years of captivity he exerted his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his neighborhood. Although released in 1709, his departure from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he again refused to relinquish Quebec for a richer see, was delayed till 1713. His venerable predecessor had died in 1708. St-Vallier was firm in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and in perfect union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The results of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> still abide. He published a "Rituel du dioc&egrave;se de Qu&eacute;bec" (Paris, 1703); "Cat&eacute;chisme de Qu&eacute;bec (Paris, 1702), presided at four <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (1690, 1694, 1698, 1700), and issued a great number of <em>mandements</em>, letters, and other episcopal documents, over one hundred of which have been published in the collection of "Les mandements des &eacute;v&ecirc;ques de Qu&eacute;bec". He died after forty years' episcopate, nearly half of which he was forced to spend far from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Though his overbearing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and excessive desire to perform all the good that he had in view occasionally elicited measures that were displeasing and even offensive, these were fully outbalanced by his generosity towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and his genuine disinterestedness.
