<h1>Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois-Albert du Pouget</h1>  

<p>Marquis de Nadaillac, b. in 1817; d. at Rougemont, Cloyes, 1 October, 1904; the scion of an old <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and one of the most distinguished among modern men of anthropologic science. He devoted his earlier years to public affairs, and served in 1871 and 1877 respectively as prefect of the Departments of Basses-Pry&eacute;n&eacute;es and Indre-et-Loire, proving himself an able and sympathetic administrator. On completing his term of office he retired into private life and devoted himself to scientific research, chiefly in the lines of <a href="../cathen/11410a.htm">pal&aelig;ontology</a> and anthropology, giving particular attention to American questions, upon which he was a leading authority. He had much to do with the exploration of the caves of southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, being especially interested in the evidence of artistic development in the primitive occupants. He was probably the foremost authority on cave drawings. He studied deeply the relation of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and was one of the first to warn the French nation of the impending danger of race suicide. To a dignified presence he united an exquisite politeness which sprang from a kind heart. Of a spiritual temperament, he was an earnest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. He died at his ancestral chateau of Rougemont, near Cloyes, Department of Eure-et-Loir, in his 87th year, and, as officially announced, "fortified by the sacraments of the Church", combining in himself the highest type of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> gentleman and profound scientist. He was a member of learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in every part of the world, including several in the united States, and he held decorations from half a dozen Governments, besides being a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He was also a correspondent of the Institute of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>His published volumes and shorter papers cover a remarkably wide range of interest. In this country he is probably best known for his great work on Prehistoric America (in French), published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1883, and in English at New York in 1884. Among other important papers may be noted those on "Tertiary Man" (1885); "Decline of the Birthrate in France" (1886); "The Glacial Epoch" (1886); "Manners and Monuments of Prehistoric Peoples" (Paris, 1888); "Origin and Development of Life upon the Globe" (1888); "Prehistoric Discoveries and Christian Beliefs" (1889); "Most Ancient Traces of Man in America" (1890); "The First Population of Europe" (1890); "The National Peril" (1890); "The Progress of Anthropology" (1891); "Intelligence and Instinct" (1892); "The Depopulation of France" (1892); "The Lacustrine Population of Europe" (1894); "Faith and Science" (1895); "Evolution and Dogma" (1896); "Unity of the Human Species" (1897); "Man and the Ape" (1898); "Painted or Incised Figures...of Prehistoric Caverns" (1904). Most of these appeared first, either in the journal of the Institute or in the Revue des Questions Scientifiques of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>.
