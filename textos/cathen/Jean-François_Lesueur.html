<h1>Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lesueur</h1>  

<p>Composer, b. at Drucat-Plessiel, near Abbeville, 15 Feb., 1760; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 6 October, 1837. He came of an ancient and illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Picardy, his great uncle being the celebrated <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, Eustache Lesueur. At seven he became a chorister at Abbeville. From 1774 to 1779 he studied music at the College of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, then became music-master at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>, and later assistant-master at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Innocents at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he studied under Abb&eacute; Roze. He was appointed music-master at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> in 1781, at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> in 1782, at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 1783, and at the Holy Innocents, Paris, in 1784. In 1786 he competed for the musical directorship of Notre-Dame-de-Paris and received the appointment. Allowed by the chapter to install a complete orchestra, he at once proceeded to put in practice his novel <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a>. It was his aim to arouse devotion by an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and he so far carried out his theories as to preface one of his masses with an operatic overture; this caused a stir in the musical world. In 1787 came an anonymous attack on his compositions and his methods, to which Lesueur replied in a pamphlet entitled "Expos&eacute; d'une musique imitative et particuli&egrave;re &agrave; chaque solennit&eacute;" (Paris, 1787). At this period he became an abb&eacute;, but never received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. The chapter of Notre-Dame having reduced the orchestra because of the heavy expense, Lesueur was unable to produce his masses, and resigned his directorship in 1788. He withdrew to the country home of his friend M. Bochart de Champigny, where he remained four years, working on his compositions. In 1793 he produced a three-act opera, "La Caverne", at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Feydeau, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Its success was immediate and brilliant and it was followed at the same theatre by "Paul et Virginie" (13 Jan., 1794) and "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque" (May, 1796), which latter had been accepted by the Royal Academy of Music.

<p>He was appointed professor in the Ecole de la Garde Nationale, 21 Nov., 1793, and an inspector of instruction at the Conservatoire de Musique from its foundation in 1795. On the rejection of two of his operas, "Ossian, ou les Bardes" and "La mort d'Adam" (which had been accepted by the Academy), in favour of Catel's "Semiramis", Lesueur published anonymously a pamphlet entitled "Projet d'un plan g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'instruction musicale en France", in which he <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked not only the methods of instruction followed at the Conservatoire, but his rival Catel and Catel's patron, the director of the Conservatoire. Lesueur's dismissal followed (23 Sept., 1802), and the cessation of his salary had brought him to the verge of extreme poverty when he was appointed <em>ma&icirc;tre de chapelle</em> to the First Consul. The musician was now free to produce his "Ossian"; its first performance (10 July, 1804) was a great success and inaugurated the new title of the theatre as Acad&eacute;mie Imp&eacute;riale. He was rewarded with the Cross of the Legion of Honour. For the emperor's <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> he composed a mass and a <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a>. He collaborated with Persuis in his "L'inauguration du temple de la victoire" (2 Jan., 1807) and "Le Triomphe de Trajan" (23 Oct., 1807). On 21 March, 1809, he produced "La mort d'Adam et son apoth&eacute;ose", which proved to be lacking in dramatic action. In 1813 Lesueur succeeded Gr&eacute;try at the Institut, and in the following year was appointed superintendent and composer of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Louis XVIII, retaining this post until the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in 1830. On 1 Jan., 1818, he was appointed professor of composition at the Conservatoire, his classes being large and numbering distinguished members, of whom the following gained the <em>prix de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a></em>: Bourgeois, Ermel, Paris, Guiraud, <a href="../cathen/02495a.htm">Berlioz</a>, Pr&eacute;vost, Ambroise Thomas, Elwart, <a href="../cathen/02713b.htm">Boulanger</a>, Besozzi, Boisselot (who became Lesueur's son-in-law), and <a href="../cathen/06683b.htm">Gounod</a>. Lesueur wrote the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> and other music for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles X at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (29 May, 1825). His other compositions were: three operas which had been accepted by the Op&eacute;ra but were never performed in his lifetime, "Tyrh&eacute;e", "Artaxerse", and "Alexandre &agrave; Babylone"; a <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> mass or <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a> (1826); a solemn mass for four voices, choir, and orchestra; two Passion <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorios</a> (1829); "Rachel", an <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a>; "Super flumina Babylonis" (1833); "Ruth et Booz", <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a>; a cantata for the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Emperor Napoleon I</a>. He also wrote "Notice sur la Melop&eacute;e, la Rhythmop&eacute;e, et les grandes caract&egrave;res de la musique ancienne" (Paris, 1793); and an unpublished treatise on the music of the Greeks. Lesueur had both originality and genius, and, while it is impossible to rank him with <a href="../cathen/03648a.htm">Cherubini</a> and M&eacute;hul, it is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the early nineteenth century is greatly indebted to his initiative and passion for his art.
