<h1>Jean-Jacques Barth&eacute;lemy</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatologist</a> and writer, b. at Cassis (Provence), 1716; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1795. He began his classical studies at the College of the Oratory in <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, took up philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> college, and finally attended the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, where he devoted most of his time to Oriental languages. He soon became renowned for his scholarship and earnestness in learned researches, in which he rivalled the Humanists of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. Having completed his course, he received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and wore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> habit without taking <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. For several years he lived in his lonely residence at Aubagne, near <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, devoting himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>, under the direction of his friend. M. Cary of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. In 1744, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and became secretary to M. de Boze, keeper of the medals at the King's Library, and three years later he was elected to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. In 1753, he succeeded M. de Boze and remained in this position until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, during his term nearly doubling the collection.

<p>In 1754 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on a scientific mission. On his way, he gathered a large number of medals, and conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the book which made his name famous, "Voyage du Jeune Anacarsis en Grece vers le milieu du IVe siecle avant l'ere vulgaire". This book, begun in 1756, was not finished until 1788, and was a description of ancient <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, of Hellenic civilization, institutions, arts, history, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and literature, appealing to every class by reason of its charming narratives and vivid pictures. In successive reprints and English translations (London, 1790, 1800), it still finds readers. Recent archaeological discoveries have shown some of the statements to be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, but on the whole the book remains a very successful attempt to diffuse a correct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek manners and customs. From the time of Barth&eacute;lemy's journey through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03694a.htm">Duke of Choiseul</a> had been his patron and had given him many pensions and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. After the fall of his friend (1770), Barth&eacute;lemy followed him into exile at Chanteloup, near Amboise, where unlike the <em>abb&eacute;s de cour</em> he was busily engaged in polishing his elaborate literary productions. He was elected to the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> in 1789. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, he was arrested (September, 1793) and confined in a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for a few days. On his release he declined to resume his functions as keeper of the medals, and having been despoiled of his fortune by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> died in poverty. Besides the "Voyage du jeune Anacharsis", Barth&eacute;lemy has left a number of essays on Oriental languages and archaeology, originally read before the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres; "Les amours de Caryte etde Polydore", a novel illustrating ancient manners; "Un voyage en Italie"; and "M&eacute;moires" of his life. His works were edited by Villenave (1821).
