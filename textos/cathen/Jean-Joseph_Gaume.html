<h1>Jean-Joseph Gaume</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and author, b. at Fuans (Franche-Comt&eacute;) in 1802; d. in 1879. While attached to the <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Diocese of Nevers</a>, he was successively professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, director of the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire, </em>canon, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and had already published several works, when he left for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1841. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> made him a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of the Reformed Order of St. Sylvester. A doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>, a member of several <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of scholars, honorary <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, he received from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1854 the title of prothonotary apostolic.

<p>Abb&eacute; Gaume is the author of numerous books treating of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, history, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Those of the first category are still esteemed, those of the second have fallen into oblivion, and those of the third gave rise to the famous question of the classics. These last writings are all inspired by one and the same thought; vividly struck by the religious and moral deterioration of his age, the author seeks its remote cause, and believes he finds it in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, which was for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> a resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> of antiquity, prepared the way for the Revolution, and was, in fine, the primal source of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Such is the dominating <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the works "La R&eacute;volution" (8 vols., 1856) and "Histoire de la societ&eacute; domestique" (2 vols., 1854). It is again met with in "Les Trois Rome" (1857). But to cure the ills of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to devise a new method of moulding childhood and youth<em>; </em>this was to consist in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction and the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors from classical studies. In support of this method he composed his "Cat&eacute;chisme de Pers&eacute;v&eacute;rance, ou Expos&eacute; de la Religion depuis l'origine du monde jusqu'&agrave; nos jours" (8 vols., 1854); "La Religion et l'Eternit&eacute;" (1859); "Trait&eacute; de l'Esprit Saint (1864). To this series of works belong his "Manuel du Confesseur" (1 854) and "l'Horloge de la Passion" (1857), which he translated from <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>.

<p>The reform, or rather the revolution &#151; the word is his &#151; which he deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in classic instruction he had indicated as early as 1835 in his book "Le Catholicisme dans l'&eacute;ducation", without arousing much comment. He returned to the subject in 1851 in a work entitled "Le Ver rongeur des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s modernes ou le Paganisme dans l'Education". The renown of the author, still more the patronage of two influential <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/06684b.htm">Mgr. Gousset</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and Mgr. Parisis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> &#151; and above all the articles of <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a> in "L'Univers", which supported Abb&eacute; Gaume from the first, gained for his views a hearing which they had previously failed to secure, and provoked a lively controversy among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. After having shown that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> formation of youth during the first centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was accomplished through the study of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors (ch. i-vi), Gaume proceeds to prove that the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> of the sixteenth century perverted <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the substitution of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> writers for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors. In support of his thesis, he brings forward the testimony of men (viii-ix) and of facts (x-xxv), indicating the influence of classical <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> on literature, speech, the arts, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, religion, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Despite a proportion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the exaggeration of his thesis was evident. It was the condemnation of the method held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for three centuries; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> themselves had, without opposition from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, made the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors the basis of the curriculum in their colleges. Gaume did not go so far as to exclude the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> texts; he allowed them some place in the three highest classes (the course comprised eight), but banished them from the first five years.

<p>Consulted by the professors of his <em>petit s&eacute;minaire </em>as to the course to pursue, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Mgr. Dupanloup</a>, addressed them a letter on classical teaching, in which he boldly declared himself in favour of the existing regulations and methods, thus preserving for the ancient authors the rank they had hitherto held, but at the same time assigned an important place to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the Fathers, and modern authors. Sharply attacked by <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Veuillot</a> in "L'Univers", the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> retorted by issuing a pastoral on the classics and especially on the interference of lay journalism in episcopal administration, and concluded by enjoining on the professors of his <em>petits s&eacute;minaires </em>to receive no longer "L'Univers". Then the question became even more burning; newspaper articles, brochures, pamphlets, even books succeeded one another on this question which created a general commotion among educationists. Gaume published in support of his thesis the "Lettre sur le paganisme dans l'&eacute;ducation". For a time it seemed as though the diocese were on the point of division. At this juncture <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Mgr. Dupanloup</a> drew up a declaration which was signed by forty-six <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. It contained four articles, two of which dealt with journalism in its relations with episcopal authority, and two with the use of the classics. It was therein stated: (1) that the employment of the ancient classics in secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, when properly chosen, carefully expurgated, and explained from a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> point of view, was neither <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nor dangerous; (2) that, however, the use of these ancient classics should not be exclusive, but that it was useful to join to it in becoming measure, as is generally done in all houses directed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the study and explanation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors. Abb&eacute; Gaume and his partisans lost no time in reducing their claims to the three following points: (1) the more comprehensive expurgation of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> writers; (2) the more extensive &igrave;ntroduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors; (3) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors. Nevertheless it required instructions from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to put an end to this controversy. The Abb&eacute; Gaume published further: "Biblioth&egrave;que des classiques chr&eacute;tiens, latins et grecs" (30 vols., 1852-55); "Po&egrave;tes et Prosateurs profanes compl&egrave;tement expurg&eacute;s" (1857).
