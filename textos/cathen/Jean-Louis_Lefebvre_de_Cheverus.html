<h1>Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, U.S.A.</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>; <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux, France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at Mayenne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 28 January, 1768; d. at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> 19 July, 1836. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> when not yet twenty-three, he was appointed assistant to an uncle, whom he shortly succeeded as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Mayenne, receiving faculties, also, to act as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Refusal to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> imposed by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> cost him his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and very nearly his life. He escaped from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, in disguise. Proferred aid on his arrival, he replied: "The little I have will suffice until I learn something of the language. Once acquainted with that, I can earn my living by manual labour, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>". In three months he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> English enough to teach, and within a year gathered a congregation. A letter from a former professor, the Rev. Francis A. Matignon, then <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, told him of the hard conditions and crying needs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> work there, urging, also, his peculiar fitness for bringing it to success, if he would only come there. The call was heeded. Arriving in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 3 October, 1796, he wrote Bishop Carroll: "Send me where you think I am most needed, without making yourself anxious about the means of my support. I am willing to work with my hands, if need be".

<p>His work in New England, covering twenty-seven years, included every form of missionary activity. He lived among the Indians, mastering their dialect; trudged on foot long distances, attending scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; nursed the sick and buried the dead during two yellow-fever epidemics; collected funds and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>; was business-man, adviser, peacemaker, servant, doctor for his flock, failing them in no form of helpfulness. This disinterested devotion to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> joined with extraordinary tact gradually won the respect of the prejudiced <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>. Closer acquaintance, revealing Cheverus's brilliant talents, wide learning, innate refinement, transparent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and Christ-like charity, deepened respect into confidence, veneration, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Ministers invited him to their <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a>. The legislature sought and acted on his counsels. At a state banquet to President John Adams (whose name had headed a list of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> contributors to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> building fund), he was placed next the guest of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Named first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 8 April, 1808, he was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> owing to the non-arrival of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> until 1 November, 1810.

<p>Philadelphia sought him as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Baltimore as coadjutor; "I pray, I supplicate, I entreat with heartfelt earnestness", he besought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, "that I may never be transferred; that I may be permitted to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> all my cares to my small but beloved flock". He had conquered prejudice, but his delicate constitution could not withstand a harsh climate. Impending loss of health was made the valid excuse of his recall to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">See of Montauban</a>, 15 January, 1823. His departure struck <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with consternation. Non-Catholics formally protested, "What will become of the American church?" cried Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal. "You were, next to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my greatest dependence". Montauban was a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> stronghold, but shortly after his arrival there a resident wrote: "There are no longer <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>; we are all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> people". On 30 July, 1826, he was elevated to the <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Archbishopric of Bordeaux</a>; Charles X made him a peer; and on 1 February, 1835, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> his career became an apologia for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. Dr. Channing, the eminent <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> divine, asked: "Who among our religious teachers would solicit a comparison between himself and the devoted Cheverus? . . . How can we shut our hearts against this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion to form good and great men? . . . It is time that greater <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were done to this ancient and widespread community". (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF BOSTON</a>.)
