<h1>Jean-Martin de Prades</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born about 1720 at Castelsarrasin (<a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Diocese of Montauban</a>), died in 1782 at Glogau, famous through an irreligious thesis. Having finished his preliminary studies, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he lived in many <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, especially in that of St-Sulpice. He very soon became acquainted with the principal publishers of the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">"Encyclop&eacute;die"</a>, and supplied them with the article on "Certitude". About the end of 1751, he presented himself for the doctorate, driven, as a <em>m&eacute;moire</em> of that time says, "by the incredulous, who, in order to justify his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, wanted to have his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> approved by the Faculty". Prades wrote a very long thesis, which the examiners accepted without reading. The defence, which took place on 18 November, was very sharp, and the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> broke out. On 15 December following, the Faculty declared several propositions to be "worthy of blame and censures". On 15 January following, the censure was published. According to Abb&eacute; de Prades, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is an unknown substance; sensations are the source of our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; the origin of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> is might, from which are derived all notions of just and of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> is empiric; <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> is only natural religion in its evolution; the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of Moses's books is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; the healings operated by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> are <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, since those operated by Esculapius present the same characteristics. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> approved the censure; afterwards, on the 2 March, <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> condemned the thesis; at last the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against the author; further, Stanislas, Duke of Lorraine, incited the Faculty against the Abb&eacute;.

<p>The latter found a refuge in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, where he published his "Apology" (1752). It consists of two parts: a third part containing "reflexions upon the Pastoral Letter of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a> and the Pastoral Instruction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Auxerre" as written by Diderot. Le P&egrave;re Brotier published "the Survey of the Apology of the Abb&eacute; de Prades" (1753). The question is whether the Abb&eacute; de Prades is not the author of an "Apology of the Abb&eacute; de Prades" in verse. Upon the recommendation of Voltaire and of the Marquis of Argens, the Abb&eacute; became <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> to Frederick of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and went to Berlin. Frederick gave him a pension and two <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a>, the one at Oppeln, the other at Glogau. From the year 1753, negotiations were entered upon between the Abb&eacute; de Prades and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, Philip von Schaffgotsch, with a view to a recantation. Frederick himself induced the Abb&eacute; to return to "the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Vencin wrote the formula of recantation which was signed by the Abb&eacute;. In 1754, the Faculty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> again inscribed the Abb&eacute; upon the list of bachelors. The Abb&eacute; de Prades became the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of the Chapter of Glogau, and died in that town in 1782.

<p>Besides the works quoted, he left an "Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastiquede Fleury", tr. Berne (Berlin, 1767), II vols., with a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> anti-catholic preface written by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. This would make us <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the sincerity of the recantation of the Abb&eacute; de Prades. To him is generally ascribed "gTombeau de la Sorbonne" translated from Latin (1782). According to Qu&eacute;rard, he left in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> a complete translation of Tacitus, which remains unpublished. What has become of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is unknown. It is said also that he worked, before leaving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at a Treatise on "the Truth of Religion".
