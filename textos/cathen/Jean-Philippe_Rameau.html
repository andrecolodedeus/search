<h1>Jean-Philippe Rameau</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">Musician</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, 25 Sept., 1683; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 12 Sept., 1764. His father, himself an <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>, was his first master. At the age of seven he was able to perform every kind of music. For his further <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he was sent to a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>; but even during class he was either singing or writing music. Excepting a short stay in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he always lived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was twice <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and from 1723 remained constantly in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> in several churches. Rameau was very tall and extraordinarily thin, so he had more the appearance of a ghost than of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human being</a>. He was a great thinker, fond of solitude, and out of place in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. In 1726 he married Marie-Louise Mangot, and had four children, a son and three daughters, one of whom entered the Order of the Visitation. Without denying the merits of <a href="../cathen/09429a.htm">Lully</a> (1633-1687) and Couperin (1663-1733), the founders of the French opera, and even admitting that Rameau was not right in all the details of his theory, we must acknowledge that he opened up a new road, which was followed by all who came after him. His main principle, for the defence of which he had to sustain hard struggles, was that melody, far from being sufficient for a good piece of music, itself depends on the rules of <a href="../cathen/07139a.htm">harmony</a>, so that the real guide of every composer is harmony, not melody. His chief merit consists in having established the relations between <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and art, and in having highly developed the symphonic part of the opera. His most famous theoretical works are: "Trait&eacute; de l'harmonie r&eacute;duite &agrave; son principe naturel" (1722); "G&eacute;n&eacute;ration harmonique" (1737); "D&eacute;monstration du principe de l'harmonie" (1750); "Code de musique pratique" (1760). Only at the age of fifty did he begin to write for the stage, and in sixteen years (1733-1749) he composed about thirty operas and ballets, the best of which are: "Castor et Pollux", "Les Indes Galantes", "Dardanus" and "Zoroastre". Of his <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> some <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a> only are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. He left many compositions for the piano, either alone or with other instruments, eighteen of which have been lately published by Vincent d'Indy. Durand, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, has undertaken a complete edition of Rameau's works, under the direction of Saint-Sa&euml;ns.
