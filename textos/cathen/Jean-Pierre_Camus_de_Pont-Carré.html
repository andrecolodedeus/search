<h1>Jean-Pierre Camus de Pont-Carr&eacute;</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. 3 November, 1584, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; d. there 25 April, 1652. A <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> of good birth, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, immediately won a reputation for eloquence, and by a special <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a> at the age of twenty-six, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Francis of Sales, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. From that event (1609) dates the close friendship which ever united the two <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The episcopal administration of Camus was marked by an ardent, though somewhat inconsiderate, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. In 1614 he went as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to the Etats-G&eacute;n&eacute;raux, and there stoutly defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Love of study and contemplation tempted him to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but, in deference to the counsels of St. Francis of Sales, Camus remained at his post until the death of that saint in 1629, when he left Belley and retired to the Abbey of Aulnay, near Caen. The coveted retirement, however, was of brief duration. Fran&ccedil;ois de Harlay, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, being incapacitated by illness, claimed the services of Camus as auxiliary. This connection with the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> lasted until the resignation of Harlay in 1651, when Camus retired to the Hospice des Incurables, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, less to be a patient than to be a sympathizer with patients. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> pressed the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> upon him, but Camus, having at length reluctantly accepted the charge, died before the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation. His remains were laid to rest in the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the hospice <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, where, until 1904, an epitaph told the tale of his disinterestedness and charity: Qui sibi pauper &mdash; Pauperibus dives &mdash; Inter pauperes &mdash; Vivere, mori et humari voluit (Poor for himself, rich for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, he wished to live, die, and be buried among the poor).

<p><a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> said of Camus that his acrimony against the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> was the only flaw in his character. Owing, doubtless, to this well-known antipathy, verging on <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, some strange charges have been made against him: Voltaire makes him the author of a vile book, "Apocalpysede Meliton", which was really written by Claude Pitois, an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, in 1668. Sauvage (R&eacute;alit&eacute; du projet de Bourg-Fontaine) accuses him of joining the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> in a plot against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, basing his accusation on the fact that, in the alleged plot, the work of defaming the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders had been assigned to one "P.C." (Pierre Camus). Sainte-Beuve (Port-Royal, I, 241) probably comes nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when he describes Camus as naively eager for public notice, and led by this foible to consort with the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> of Port-Royal, though he did not escape their ridicule. His literary activity was prodigious. Leclerc and <a href="../cathen/11051a.htm">Nic&eacute;ron</a> enumerate over two hundred books written by him. His sermons and religious novels have been completely forgotten, in spite of the efforts of H. Rigault (preface to his edition of "Palombe", 1853) and St.-Marc-Girardin (Cours de litt&eacute;rature, IV) to rescue them from oblivion. Of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and controversial works, such as "Introduction &agrave; la th&eacute;ologie" (1645); "Du chef de l'&eacute;glis&eacute;" (1630); "De la Primaute" (1630); "Enseignements cat&eacute;ch&eacute;tiques" (1642); "Correspondance de l'&eacute;criture sacr&eacute;e et de la sainte &eacute;glise" (1683); "Antith&egrave;ses protestantes" (1638), only one survives, "L'avoisinement des protestants vers l'&eacute;glise romaine" (Paris, 1640, re-edited by Richard Simon (1703), and translated into Latin by Zaccaria, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Theol. cursus compl.", V. On the other hand, his ascetical books, e.g. "L'usage de la p&eacute;nitence et communion" (1644), "Du rare ou fr&eacute;quent usage de l'Eucharistie" (1644), "Partique de la communion fr&eacute;quente" (1644), have had a great influence. One of them, "L'esprit de Saint Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales" (Paris, 1641), a minute and loving portrayal of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, has gone through many editions (Collot, Paris, 1727; Dep&eacute;ry, Paris, 1840), and two English translations of it have appeared, that of Sidney Lear (London, s.d.) and O'Shea (New York, 1869). To the same class of writings, at least in the mind of Camus, belong several pamphlets against the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>: "Le voyageur inconnu" (1630); "Le directeur spirituel" (1631); "L'antimoine" (1632); "Pauvret&eacute; &eacute;vang&eacute;lique" (1634); "Rabat-joie du triomphe monacal" (1634), and so on &mdash; sometimes quoted under the general head, "Des moines". Of these it may be said that they only detract from the otherwise good fame of their author. The Spanish translation by Cabillas of a treatise by Camus on the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been on the Spanish Index since 1747.
