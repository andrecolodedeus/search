<h1>Jean Balue</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, b. probably c. 1421, in Poitou; d. 5 October, 1491, at <a href="../cathen/13062c.htm">Ripatransone</a> (March of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>). He has been frequently, but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a>, called "de la Balue". He was graduated as licentiate in law about 1457, and at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. He became so intimate with Jacques Juv&eacute;nal des Ursins, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (1449-57), that the latter named him executor of his will. The charge that in this capacity he misappropriated funds destined for the poor must be received with reserve. After the death of Des Ursins, Balue entered the service of John de Beauvau, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a> (1451-67), who made him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1461). In 1462, he accompanied his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thenceforth his career was marked by clever and unscrupulous intrigue. On his return, he was introduced by Charles de Melun to King Louis XI (1461-83), and, owing to the royal favour, his rise both in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil affairs was rapid. In 1464, Louis XI made him his almoner; the same year, Balue received the Abbeys of F&eacute;camp and Saint-Thierri (Reims) and in 1465, that of Saint-Jean-d'Ang&eacute;ly, two <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>, and the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>. Having obtained the deposition of his benefactor, Beauvau, from the <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">See of Angers</a>, he secured the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for himself (1467). His intrigues in the affair of the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> procured him, at the request of Louis XI, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> (1464-71) reluctantly raised him (1467). Guilty of high treason, he was arrested two years later (1469) with his accomplice William d'Haraucourt, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> (1456-1500). As a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he could not be judged by a civil tribunal, but the negotiations between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the king, regarding his trial, remaining fruitless, he was held captive by Louis XI for eleven years (1469-80). The baseless story of his detention in an iron cage originated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the sixteenth century. After many fruitless attempts, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1480 obtained Balue's freedom through Cardinal Julian de la Rovere, later <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (1503-13). Balue went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was restored to all his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and dignities (1482) and was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> (1483). At the death of Louis XI (1483) he came, at the request of Charles VIII, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and left it as French ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1485). Balue succeeded, moreover, in securing, besides several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> as Protector of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Order of St. John of Jerusalem</a> and Guardian to Prince Djem, brother of the Sultan of Turkey. But his end was near; he died in 1491 and was buried at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He had attained numerous dignities and amassed wealth, but dishonoured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
