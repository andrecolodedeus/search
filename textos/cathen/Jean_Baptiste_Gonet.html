<h1>Jean Baptiste Gonet</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. about 1616 at Beziers, in the province of Languedoc; d. there 24 Jan., 1681. From his early boyhood he was devout and fond of study. He received his primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native place, and there at the age of seventeen entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">University of Bordeaux</a>, where with unusual ability he devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, winning all honours in the customary examinations before advancement. Having received the doctorate he was appointed to the chair of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, in which capacity he proved himself a brilliant <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and an exceptionally gifted teacher. In 1671 he was elected <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his province; on the expiration of his term of office, he resumed the professorship of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, holding it till 1678, when ill-health <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to return to his native place. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and academic disputant Gonet ranks among the most prominent figures of his time. An ardent defender and exponent of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and an illustrious representative of <a href="../cathen/10746a.htm">Neo-Thomism</a>, he set forth the traditional teaching of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with astonishing clearness and skill, with some bitterness against the representatives of different views. He lived at a time when <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion was rife, when men, weary of treading beaten paths, had set themselves to constructing systems of their own. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, however, for the integrity of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> teaching, and his bitter aversion from <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> novelty sometimes carried him beyond the teaching of his master, and led him to adopt opinions on certain questions of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> especially those dealing with <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and reprobation which were rejected by many learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In 1669 he published a work on the morality of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a>, the purpose of which was to defend the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at once against what he calls the laxities of the modern casuists, and the rigorism of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. In this treatise he defends the probabiliorism of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and in the heat of the controversy is unsparing in his denunciations of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">probabilism</a>. His principal work is the "Clypeus theologiae thomisticae contra novos ejus impugnatores" (16 vols, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 1659-69). From 1669 to 1681 no less than nine editions of this work appeared, the latest is that of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1875. Shortly before his death he published his "Manuale thomistarum", which is an abridgment of his larger work.
