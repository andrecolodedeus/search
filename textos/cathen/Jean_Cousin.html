<h1>Jean Cousin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, etcher, engraver, and geometrician, born at Soucy, near <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, 1500; died at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> before 1593, probably in 1590. Cousin began his long art-life in his native town with the study of glass-painting under Hympe and Grassot. At the same time he was diligently applying himself to this branch of art, wherein he was to become a master, the young man became a great student of mathematics and published a successful book on the subject. He also wrote on geometry in his student days. In 1530 Cousin finished the beautiful windows for the Sens <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the subject chosen being the "Legend of St. Eutropius". He had also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the windows of many of the noble ch&acirc;teaux in and around the city. The latest date on any of his Sens work, 1530, points to this as the year he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he began work as a goldsmith; but the amount and kind of his productions in the precious metals are alike unknown.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Cousin continued his eminent career as a glass-painter, and his masterpiece, the windows of the Sainte-Chapelle in Vincennes, are considered the finest examples of glass-painting in all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He subsequently devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in oil, and is said to be the first <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> to use the "new medium". For this and other reasons Cousin has been called "The Founder of the French School"; but his work in oil, while graceful, refined, reserved, and even classically severe, is more that of an Italian "Eclectic" than of a "founder of a national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>". Pictures attributed to him, all of much merit, are found in several of the large <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> collections, but, excepting "The Last Judgment", none is known to be authentic. "The Last Judgment" is fine in composition, noble in conception. and beautiful and harmonious in colour, strongly suggesting Correggio. For a Long time this masterpiece, which won him the name of the "French Michelangelo", lay neglected in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of the church of the Minims, Vincennes, until it was rescued by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and became one of the important works in the Louvre. It is also celebrated for being the first French picture to be engraved.

<p>In the sixteenth century Cousin's renown came from his historical and glass-paintings; today he is best known as an illustrator of books. He made many fine designs for woodcuts and often executed them himself. The "Bible", published in 1596 by Le Clerc, and the "Metamorphoses" and "Epistles" of Ovid (1566 and 1571 respectively) contain his most celebrated work as an illustrator. Cousin etched and engraved many plates after the manner of <a href="../cathen/11506b.htm">Mazzuola</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, to whom the invention of etching has been ascribed; but he excels all his contemporaries in facility of execution and classical breadth and simplicity of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and feeling. His etched work approaches in excellence the oil-paintings of the great masters. Cousin's <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> are full of strength and dignity. The mausoleum of Admiral Philippe de Chabot is the best piece of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of the sixteenth century; the strikingly beautiful <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Louis de Brez&eacute; (Rouen) is another celebrated achievement. In addition to his early writings on mathematics, he published, in 1560, a learned treatise on perspective, and, in 1571, an excellent work on portrait-painting. During his life Cousin successfully pursued every branch of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and enjoyed the favour of, and worked for four kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>: Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. Among his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, in addition to the "Last Judgment", mention should be made of the miniatures in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book of Henry II now in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale; among his etchings and engravings, the "Annunciation" and the "Conversion of St. Paul"; among his woodcuts, the "Entr&eacute;e de Henry II et Catherine de M&eacute;dicis &agrave; Rouen" (1551).
