<h1>Jean Druys</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> DRUSIUS)

<p>Thirtieth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Parc near <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, b. at Cumptich, near Tirlemont; d. 25 March, 1635. He studied successively at St-Trond, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of Parc in 1587. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> College at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and obtained his licentiate in 1595. Recalled to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, he was made sub-prior and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to the young religious at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Abbot Ambrose Loots at the Refuge, which the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> possessed at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> during the troublous times at the end of the sixteenth century, and at the death of Abbot Loots his successor. Four years later he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the Abbot-General of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, and was later named by Archduke Albert a member of the States of Brabant and of his private council. The <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> having suffered much from the religious and political disturbances of the time, Druys was appointed, with a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, visitor to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, with full power to reform abuses, a task which was not completed until 1617. He was also made visitor to the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">University of Douai</a> (1616) and to the Celestine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at H&eacute;verl&eacute;. In addition he restored and enlarged his own <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which had suffered much from the vandalism of the soldiers, and provided better <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> advantages for his religious. At the general chapter held at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a> in 1628, Abbot Druys was commissioned to revise the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the order and conform them to the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, a revision which was approved at the general chapter of 1630. Druys prefixed a preface, "Praefatio ad omnes candidissimi et canonici ordinis religiosos", which Foppens characterizes as <em>longam, piam, eruditam</em>. He had a tree of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the order made by the skilful engraver, C. Mallery. He also published a small work entitled "Exhortatio ad candidi ordinis religiosos". Abbot Druys was deputed by the general chapter of 1630 to bring back several <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> into union and observance, but was unsuccessful. While on this mission he conferred with Phillip IV on the sad state of affairs in Brabant. A ring presented to him by this monarch is preserved at Parc, as is also a letter from Henrietta Maria, Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
