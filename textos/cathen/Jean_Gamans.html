<h1>Jean Gamans</h1>  

<p>Born 8 July, 1606, at Ahrweiler (according to other sources at Neuenahr, about two miles from Ahrweiler; there does not appear to exist any documentary evidence to show that he was born at the little town of Eupen, as stated in the "Biblioth&egrave;que des &eacute;crivains de la Compagnie de J&eacute;sus"); d. at the College of Aschaffenburg near <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 25 Nov., 1684. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> on 24 April, 1623, having studied the humanities for five years and philosophy for two years at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he had received the degree of Master of Arts. After making his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, he devoted several months to a revision of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, and subsequently, from 1626, spent five years teaching in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Wurzburg, conducting his pupils through the five classes which comprised the complete course in humanities. He then studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for a year at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1631), after which, the houses of his province of the Upper Rhine being suppressed during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Sweden, he continued his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies for three years at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 26 March, 1633. These studies having come to an end in 1634, and being followed doubtless by the third year of probation, he discharged for several years the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the land and naval troops in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. We find him mentioned under this title (Castrensis) in the catalogue of the Flandro-Belgian province for 1641 as being attached to the professed house at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, where he made his profession of the four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 26 December of the same year. He lived here with the first two <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, Jean Bolland and <a href="../cathen/07240a.htm">Godefroid Henschen</a>, became inflamed with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for their work and was henceforth their assiduous collaborator, whithersoever his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> called him, but especially at Baden-Baden, where he resided for some time in order to direct the studies of the young princes of the House of Baden. He was undoubtedly there in 1641 and 1649. At the end of this latter year he resided in a missionary capacity at Ettlingen near Karlsruhe. Here we lose all sight of him until 1681, when he was attached to the College of Aschaffenburg near <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, where he died 25 November, 1684.

<p>For more than thirty years, it is stated in the death notice inserted in the Annual letters of the College of Aschaffenburg for that year, he was so immersed in the hagiographical researches which he had undertaken in behalf of his associates at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> that he devoted to them even the hours of the night, taking only a short rest on the floor or a strip of matting. Indeed, his name occurs very often in the "Acta SS." at the head of documents transcribed by his hand, and even of commentaries written entirely by him (cf. "Bibl. des &eacute;criv. de la C. de J", sv. "Gamans"). A large number of papers of this description is to be found in the vast <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> collection of the early <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> preserved at the Royal Library of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and in the modern Ballandist <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, although the largest part of his papers, dispatched to the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> after his death, were engulfed in the Main, the vessel bearing the precious freight having unfortunately sunk. Gamans had also collected a mass of material for a "Metropolis Moguntina", which he wished to compose on the model of the "Metropolis Salisburgensis" published by Hund in 1582, and also for a history of the grand ducal House of Baden. As many as eight <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the latter work are known to exist, but no portion of it or of the "Metropolis Moguntina" has been printed.
