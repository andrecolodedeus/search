<h1>Jean Lejeune</h1>  

<p>Born at Poligny in 1592; died at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, 19 Aug., 1672; member of the Oratory of Jesus, founded by de <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Berulle</a> in 1611. He was distinguished by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his life, but his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> mainly depends upon his renown as a preacher. The energy with which he conducted his apostolate, gained for him the name of "The Missionary of the Oratory" and the blindness which overtook him at the age or thirty-five, the further appellation of "The Blind Father". He was the son of a lawyer at Dole, of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which during the previous century had attained to a high position in the magistracy and was renowned for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and virtue of its members. Owing to the early loss of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> devolved upon his mother who devoted herself to his spiritual advancement. Having studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the University of Dole, he fell under the influence of <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Berulle</a> and entered the Oratory in 1614. He was appointed director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a> but soon manifested his vocation to mission work among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and henceforward all his effort was directed to this. His life was unmarked by any external event except the loss of sight which occurred in 1627, while he was preaching the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, but this caused no cessation in his apostolic work. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> employed him in preaching the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> courses and the Government in the conversion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. He avoided the custom of treating controversial matter in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and confined himself to the exposition of fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>. It was a novel <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his to introduce after his discourses an abridgement of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. He also held conferences for the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in his methods and was recommended by <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a> to young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> for their imitation. The French Oratory was suspected of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and he was himself criticized on the ground that his preaching led to unsatisfactory results. In 1600 he appealed for advice to Arnauld, who ascribed these results to the laxity of imprudent confessors under the influence of casuistry, and dissuaded him from the design of abandoning his mission work. His sermons in twelve volumes were published at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Paris, and Rouen before his death, and a Latin translation at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1667. There is an edition published at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1826, but the latest and best edition is that of Peltier in ten volumes issued in 1889. Four volumes of extracts also appeared at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1825 under title of "Pens&eacute;es du P. Lejeune".
