<h1>Jean Martianay</h1>  

<p>Born 30 Dec., 1647, at Saint-Sever-Cap, <a href="../cathen/01237a.htm">Diocese of Aire</a>; died 16 June, 1717, at Saint Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of St. Maur at an early age, and devoted himself to Biblical studies. He is spoken of repeatedly in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> annals as "most learned in Greek and Hebrew", and he was ever engaged in perfecting his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He spent over thirty years in searching the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for information, particularly with regard to the works of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. A circular letter of Martianay's is still extant, in which he begs the co-operation of all the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in the work of producing a critical and complete edition of Jerome's writings. <a href="../cathen/14463c.htm">Ziegelbauer</a> says (op. cit. below, II, 58) that Martianay completed without aid the gigantic task of editing <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works; this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if we except the "Divina Bibliotheca", or Hieronymian edition of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. This work was executed with the collaboration of Dom Ant. Pouget. Martianay's fame as editor of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> has unfortunately eclipsed his repute as a Biblical scholar. He undertook the work of editing <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> simply because he felt the pressing need of such an edition for all who devoted themselves to Biblical research. He himself taught Scripture at Arles, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>. In addition, he published many critical works on Biblical questions; he wrote a treatise on inspiration against Richard Simon; also a vindication of the Hebrew text and of the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> given in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. Martianay also treated of the history of the canon; the French versions of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the "Tentamen Versionis": and wrote a treatise on "The Method of explaining <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>". In 1711 he published the life of a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Beaume.

<p>In one sense it may be said that Martianay's most important contribution to Biblical criticism was his edition of the "Divina Bibliotheca", or <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> text of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. It was a bold thing at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to attempt to reproduce <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> text, for the materials were comparatively scanty, and, considering the means at his disposal, Martianay's work was a triumph, not only of industry, but of critical acumen. He tells us at the close of his prolegomena what <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> he had at his disposal, six in all, the most important of which was the famous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Sangermanensis. Martianay published (1695) a separate collation of this text in his edition of the old Latin version of St. Matthew's Gospel and of the Epistle of St. James. This collation, reproduced by <a href="../cathen/02541b.htm">Bianchini</a> in his "Evangelium Quadruplex", was faulty, and the student will find a correction of it in the first volume of Wordsworth and White, "Old Latin Biblical Texts". <a href="../cathen/14463c.htm">Ziegelbauer</a> mentions also another work of Martianay, never printed, namely, an edition of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> with variant readings suggested by the Hebrew and Greek texts, and furnished with a series of references to the parallel passages. He also published the three psalters of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; these appeared in French. Lastly should be mentioned his "New Testament in French" (2 vols., Paris, 1712).
