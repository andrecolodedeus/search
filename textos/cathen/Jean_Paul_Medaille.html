<h1>Jean Paul Medaille</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary; b. at <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>, the capital of the Department of Aude, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 29 January, 1618; d. at <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, the capital of the Department of Gers, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 15 May, 1689. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 15 August, 1640, and after completing his studies spent a number of years in the classroom, teaching both the lower and higher studies of the college courses and particularly, for the space of six years, philosophy. Later he was applied to the work of preaching, which may be regarded as his life work; to this he gave himself up almost exclusively for eighteen years, until advancing age and the infirmities brought on by his laborious and austere life forced him to devote himself to the less fatiguing work of directing sodalities and of hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, especially of the poor. He was one of the number of illustrious missioners formed in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Francis Regis of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and spent the best years of his life in the evangelization of Velay, Auvergne, Languedoc, and Aveyron. His apostolic labours were attended with greater and more lasting fruit, because he established wherever he preached fervent sodalities of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who, by all sorts of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, such as instructing children, visiting the sick, helping the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, perpetuated and extended the fruits of his missions. These <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sodalities, however, lacked certain elements which Father Medaille regarded as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the stability of his work. Their members, although devoted, were hampered in many ways and by many ties in the exercise of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Father Medaille resolved, therefore, to start a congregation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who should give themselves up wholly and unreservedly to all the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Having matured his plans, he laid them before Mgr de Maupas, who gave them his fullest approval. Shortly after, Father Medaille founded the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the congregation was drawn, at least to a certain extent, from the works of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, but the details of its practical development were based almost entirely on the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. It is as the founder of this congregation that Father Medaille is best known. His active life left him no time for writing; consequently we have nothing from his pen, aside from some correspondence, except the "Constitutions pour la Congr&eacute;gation des Soeurs de Saint Joseph". These constitutions have been incorrectly attributed to Father Peter Medaille, S.J. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Father Peter Medaille contributed much in later years to the establishment on a firm basis and to the spread of the congregation, but at the time of its foundation he was still a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> and had neither the experience nor the authority <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for so responsible a work.
