<h1>Jean, Sire de Joinville</h1>  

<p>Seneschal of Champagne, historian, b. in 1225; d. at Joinville, 1317. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> held an important place in the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system of Champagne in the eleventh century. His father, Simon de Joinville, hereditary Seneschal of Champagne, defended Troyes in 1230 against the enemies of Count Thibaut IV. Simon having died in 1233, Jean was reared by his mother, <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a>, daughter of the Count of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. He received the knightly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the times, learned to read and write, and even a little Latin. In 1241, Jean de Joinville appeared for the first time at the French Court on the occasion of the festival given at Saumur for the knighthood of Alfonso of Poitou, brother of the king. He afterwards made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the shrine of St. James at <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>. In 1248, Joinville took the cross, following the example of St. Louis, but refused to be sworn by the king, as he was not his "man." He took at his own expense two bannerets and ten <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and allied himself with his cousin Jean d'Apremont, Count of Saarbruecken. His little troop went down the Sa&ocirc;ne and the Rhone by boat and embarked at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (August, 1348). In three weeks they arrived at Limassol, in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, where <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a> was. He welcomed Joinville and took him into his pay.

<p>Joinville took part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he conducted himself valiantly; he was in grave danger at Mansourah (Feb., 1250), fell ill in his tent, and was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> with the king. Having been liberated in May, 1250, he followed <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a> to Saint Jean d'Acre despite the advice of powerful barons who counselled him to remain in Palestine until all the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> should have been freed. A "Chanson d'Acre," of which he is probably the author, makes allusion to these facts ("Romania," 1893, 544). The king, who was charmed, made him henceforth his familiar friend, and gave him command over fifty <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>. In 1253 he granted him in fief a rental of 200 pounds (4053 francs).

<p>Having returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with the king and queen in 1254, Joinville thenceforth divided his time between the management of his estates and the court of his royal friend. However, in 1267, despite the solicitations of St. Louis, he refused to take the cross and disapproved of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> of <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>: "Je entendi que tuit cil firent p&eacute;chi&eacute; mortel qui li loierent l'al&eacute;e" (ed. Natalis de Wailly, 262). After the death of St. Louis in 1282, he was one of the witnesses heard in the inquiry of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and he erected an altar to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Laurent at Joinville. Under <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, Joinville played an important part in Champagne and did not conceal his dislike for the new methods of government. In 1314 he entered the league of the nobility of Champagne. In 1315 he wrote a letter of reconciliation to Louis X. He died at Joinville, where he was buried.

<p>Joinville is the author of a new explanation of the Creed, composed at Acre in 1250-51, which contains information concerning his captivity (ed. Natalis de Wailly, at the end of the history of St. Louis). But his chief work is "Le livre des saintes paroles et des bonnes actions de St Louis," composed at the request of Jeanne of Navarre, wife of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> (d. 1305). The work is divided into two unequal parts; the first, which is very short, comprises anecdotes concerning St. Louis's manner of life and his familiar speech; the second, which is very much longer, is a real autobiography of Joinville during the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. Gaston <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> ("Romania," 1894, 508-524) supposes that this portion was written by Joinville as early as 1273, because there is no allusion to subsequent events.

<p>Joinville appears to have written from personal recollections. Beginning with 1254, he is satisfied with making extracts from the "Chronique de France." The book concludes with an abridgment of the instructions given by St. Louis to his son, and with details concerning his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. The original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which was presented to the king and preserved in the <em>librairie</em> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, no longer exists. The two principal <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are: that of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (Paris, Bib. Nat. fr., 13568), written under <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>; and that of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> (Paris, Bib. Nat. fr., 10148), copied from the original at the Ch&acirc;teau of Joinville about 1550. The first edition (Antoine-Pierre de Rieux, Poitiers, 1547) was made from a poor copy and was reproduced many times until the discovery of the two above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The text has been studied and amended by Natalis de Wailly (editions of 1868, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'Histoire de France of 1874, of 1881). The history of St. Louis is rightly regarded as one of the masterpieces of French literature in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; it constitutes besides an inappreciable testimony concerning the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of one of the best sovereigns who ever reigned. The figure of St. Louis is most vividly portrayed in Joinville's book. Moreover, few personal memoirs possess the same note of sincerity. In depicting himself, Joinville discloses to us the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a perfect <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of the thirteenth century; the book is thus an important witness concerning French <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.
