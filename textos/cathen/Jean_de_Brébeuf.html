<h1>Jean de Br&eacute;beuf</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, born at Cond&eacute;-sur-Vire in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, 25 March, 1593; died in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, near Georgian Bay, 16 March, 1649. His desire was to become a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, but he finally entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> as a scholastic, 8 November, 1617. According to <a href="../cathen/12633b.htm">Ragueneau</a> it was 5 October. Though of unusual physical strength, his health gave way completely when he was twenty-eight, which interfered with his studies and permitted only what was strictly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, so that he never acquired any extensive <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. On 19 June, 1625, he arrived in Quebec, with the Recollect, Joseph de la Roche d' Aillon, and in spite of the threat which the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> captain of the ship made to carry him back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he remained in the colony. He overcame the dislike of the colonists for <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and secured a site for a residence on the St. Charles, the exact location of a former landing of Jacques Cartier. He immediately took up his abode in the Indian wigwams, and has left us an account of his five months' experience there in the dead of winter. In the spring he set out with the Indians on a journey to Lake Huron in a canoe, during the course of which his life was in constant danger. With him was Father de No&uuml;e, and they established their first mission near Georgian Bay, at Ihonatiria, but after a short time his companion was recalled, and he was left alone.

<p>Br&eacute;beuf met with no success. He was summoned to Quebec because of the danger of extinction to which the entire colony was then exposed, and arrived there after an absence of two years, 17 July, 1628. On 19 July, 1629, <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> surrendered to the English, and the missionaries returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Four years afterwards the colony was restored to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and on 23 March, 1633, Br&eacute;beuf again set out for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. While in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he had pronounced his solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as spiritual coadjutor. As soon as he arrived, viz., May, 1633, he attempted to return to Lake Huron. The Indians refused to take him, but during the following year he succeeded in reaching his old mission along with Father Daniel. It meant a journey of thirty days and constant danger of death. The next sixteen years of uninterrupted labours among these savages were a continual series of privations and sufferings which he used to say were only roses in comparison with what the end was to be. The details may be found in the "Jesuit Relations".

<p>In 1640 he set out with <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Father Chaumonot</a> to evangelize the Neutres, a tribe that lived north of Lake Erie, but after a winter of incredible hardship the missionaries returned unsuccessful. In 1642 he was sent down to Quebec, where he was given the care of the Indians in the Reservation at Sillery. About the time the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was at its height between the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Jogues</a> and <a href="../cathen/02766a.htm">Bressani</a> had been captured in an effort to reach the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> country, and Br&eacute;beuf was appointed to make a third attempt. He succeeded. With him on this journey were <a href="../cathen/03551a.htm">Chabanel</a> and Garreau, both of whom were afterwards <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. They reached St. Mary's on the Wye, which was the central station of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> Mission. By 1647 the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> had made peace with the French, but kept up their <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, and in 1648 fresh disasters befell the work of the missionaries &mdash; their establishments were burned and the missionaries slaughtered. On 16 March, 1649, the enemy attacked St. Louis and seized Br&eacute;beuf and Lallemant, who could have escaped but rejected the offer made to them and remained with their flock. The two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were dragged to St. Ignace, which the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> had already captured.

<p>On entering the village, they were met with a shower of stones, cruelly beaten with clubs, and then tied to posts to be burned to death. Br&eacute;beuf is said to have <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the stake to which he was bound. The fire was lighted under them, and their bodies slashed with knives. Br&eacute;beuf had scalding water poured on his head in mockery of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, a collar of red-hot tomahawk-heads placed around his neck, a red-hot iron thrust down his throat, and when he expired his heart was cut out and eaten. Through all the torture he never uttered a groan. The <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> withdrew when they had finished their work. The remains of the victims were gathered up subsequently, and the head of Br&eacute;beuf is still kept as a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> at the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, Quebec.

<p>His memory is cherished in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> more than that of all the other early missionaries. Although their names appear with his in letters of gold on the grand staircase of the public buildings, there is a vacant niche on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, with his name under it, awaiting his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. His <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a>, manifested in such a remarkable degree at every stage of his missionary career, his almost incomprehensible endurance of privations and suffering, and the conviction that the reason of his death was not his association with the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, has set on foot a movement for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> as a saint and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. An <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> sat in 1904 for an entire year to examine his life and virtues and the cause of his death, and the result of the inquiry was forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. [He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1930. --<em>Ed.</em>]
