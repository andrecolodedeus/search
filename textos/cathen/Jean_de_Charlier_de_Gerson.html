<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Jean de Charlier de Gerson</h1>  

<p>The surname being the name of his native place; b. in the hamlet of Gerson 14 December, 1363; d. at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 12 July, 1429. The hamlet of Gerson has disappeared, but it was then a dependency of the village of Barby not far from Bethel, in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and now included in the department of Ardennes.

<p>His father, Arnauld, and his mother, Elizabeth La Chardeni&#232;re, were noted for their integrity and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. They had twelve children, of whom Jean was the eldest. He attended the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Bethel and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and at the age of fourteen entered the famous Coll&#232;ge de Navarre at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he formed a life-long friendship with the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, the illustrious <a href="../cathen/01235b.htm">Pierre d'Ailly</a> of Compi&#232;gne. In 1381 Gerson obtained the degree of licentiate of arts under Ma&#238;tre Jean Loutrier; in 1388 he received that of <em>Baccalarius Biblicus</em>; in 1390 he lectured on the "Sententi&aelig;", and in 1392 became a licentiate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He was raised to the doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in 1394, being then thirty-one years of age (cf. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, Chartul. Univers. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, III). Beffore receiving the doctorate he had written several works. In 1387 he preached before <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Pope Clement VII of Avignon</a> with a view to calling forth the condemnation of Jean de Monteson, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, who had denied the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and shortly afterwards he delivered a panegyric on <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">St. Louis, King of France</a>, thus making his debut in the oratorical career that was destined to become so brilliant.

<p>Although Gerson had won the doctorate only a year before his former teacher, Pierre d'Ailly, was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Puy (1395), <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> chose him to succeed d'Ailly in the important position of Chancellor of Notre-Dame and of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (13 April). Thenceforth he was actively interested in the extirpation of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> which, for seventeen years, had divided the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into two hostile parties that were numerically almost equal. The friend of peace and union, he always expressed a sober and moderate opinion in regard to both the Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Pope of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and on all occasions showed a strong repugnance to the violent proceedings extolled by certain members of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (No&#235;l Valois, III, 71, 180). Appointed <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of the church of Saint Donatien at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, Gerson remained there four years (1397-1401). It was at this period that he wrote the treatise, strongly <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and sober in tone, entitled: "Sententia de mode se habendi tempore schismatis" (Schwab, Johannes Gerson, Professor der Theologie und Kanzler der Universit&#228;t <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 97, 152). He had not voted to withdraw obedience from the Pope of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, for whom, in the beginning, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had declared herself (1398). He was one of the first to show that Benedict should be considered neither a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> nor a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, and that it was in no wise proper to introduce, on this plea, an action against him (Opp. Gersonii, II, ed. 1706, <em>passim</em>). Accordingly, he energetically demanded the restoration of obedience, that is to say, the cessation of that abnormal state that constituted a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> within a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but this conciliatory attitude, so conformable to his character, incurred much <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. On 18 November, 1403, he was made cur&eacute; of Saint-Jean-en-Gr&#232;ve at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, accepting the charge in addition to the office of chancellor; this favour was granted by Pope Benedict in recognition of Gerson's fidelity to him during his four years of enforced sojourn in his fortress at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The chancellor freely and openly rejoiced at the pontiff's release and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> selected him to congratulate Benedict at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. But this harmony was not to last. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, again dissatisfied with Benedict, wished to renew the withdrawal of obedience that had so poorly succeeded the first time. D'Ailly and Gerson tried to oppose the movement both before and during the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1406, and strove to urge upon their colleagues the necessity of more moderate proceedings. After long and animated discussion, they partially succeeded in obtaining that the withdrawal of obedience adopted by the members of the assembly was brought within certain limits (cf. L. Salembier, "Le grand schisme d'Occident", 221).

<p>D'Ailly and Gerson also formed a part of the solemn embassy sent to Benedict in 1407 and tried to prevail upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to resign the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> by a formal <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>; but the pontiff refused. Thereupon some of the delegates wished openly to break with him, but here again d'Ailly and Gerson caused more peaceable sentiments to triumph and laboured to retard the total rupture (L. Salembier, op. cit., 229). During the following year Gerson attended the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and delivered the opening discourse. That same year, because of his efforts at reconciliation, d'Ailly aroused the indignation of the members of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> incensed against Benedict. The king espoused their quarrel and wished to have the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> arrested; at this juncture <a href="../cathen/04011b.htm">Cl&eacute;manges</a> and Gerson, his ever- faithful pupils, wrote him touching letters of condolence [L. Salembier, "Petrus de Alliaco" (1887), 75; Opp. Gersonii, III, 429]. Gerson himself was soon to become acquainted with human vicissitudes and to be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for another reason. On 23 November, 1407, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> was assassinated in one of the streets of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by the cowardly hirelings of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. With singular audacity, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, John the Fearless (Jean sans Peur), assumed the responsibility of the deed, pleaded his own cause before King Charles VI and chose as his defending counsel, Jean Petit (8 March, 1408) who dared openly to profess the immoral theory of <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a>. The chancellor deemed it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to bring this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> first condemned seven, then nine of Jean Petit's propositions as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> and these were thrown into the fire. Later, in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, Gerson again denounced the articles incriminated (June, 1415), and repeated the denunciation seven times within fifteen days. The Fathers passed sentence on this point (6 July), by condemning <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a> in a general way without, however, mentioning the name of the powerful Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; this half-measure satisfied neither Gerson nor the Armagnacs who were at the council. The chancellor addressed the assemblage in the name of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 5 May, 1416, and eloquently protested against the too moderate and indefinite sentence aimed at John the Fearless ("Opp. Gersonii", II, 328; V, 353, 355, 362 sq.; Labbe and <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXVII, 728 sqq., Schwab, op. cit., 609). Gerson had attended neither the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1409), nor the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1412-13), but he had highly approved of both. His part in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> was, however, an important one. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, 21 February, 1415, with a delegation from the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to enter here into the details of the trial of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> (Schwab, op. cit., 540-609), of the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a> ("Opp. Gersonii", II, 658, 660), of Gerson's differences with the English, nor of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> strife (1418) with Matthew Grabon, that great enemy of new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders ("Opp. Gersonii", I, 467). Mention will be made later of his attitude towards the three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who then disputed the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, and of the theories that he set forth in the council in order to bring about the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.



<p>It was above all his struggles against John the Fearless that brought Gerson into unmerited disgrace. In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> had before this provoked a riotous disturbance against him; his house had been plundered and he had only escaped assassination by taking refuge for two months up under the vaulted roofs of Notre-Dame. After the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, whilst the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the emperor, and the fathers were returning with all due pomp to their respective countries (1418), Gerson learned that John the Fearless had sworn his destruction and that the "nation of Picardy" in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had demanded that he be disclaimed, recalled, and punished <em>atrociter</em> ("Opp. Gersonii", V, 374; <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Chartul.", etc., IV, 300; Max Lenz, "Revue historique", IX, 470). To prevent his persecutor from having an opportunity to destroy him he left <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, 15 May, 1418, and with Andr&eacute; and Cresio, who had acted as his secretaries at the council, he took the road to exile. He retired to the <a href="../cathen/10167a.htm">Benedictine Abbey of Melk</a> (M&ouml;lk) in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of which he had known at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. The Archduke Frederick wished to gain him for the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, and Gerson repaired thither but did not remain. Finally in November, 1419, the chancellor learned of the death of his sworn enemy, John the Fearless, who, by order of the Dauphin, had been slain on the bridge of the town of Montereau. Gerson at once set out for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> but did not return to Pariis, which was torn by factions and was still in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>. He directed his steps towards Lyons, called thither by his brother who was <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/16020a.htm">Celestines</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Am&eacute;d&eacute;e de Talaru (Schwab, op. cit., 767 sqq.). Here he spent his last years in exercises of devotion and in performing his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions. He also while at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> wrote various works, some of edification, some on mystical or pastoral theology, one especially being his well-known treatise: "De parvulis ad Christum trahendis". Combining example with precept, he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to surround himself with little children in the church of Saint-Paul and delighted to teach them the elements of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. These ten years were the sweetest of his militant life, and the regrets of all good men followed him to the grave. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> were attributed to him and at least five martylrologies give him the title of Blessed. Over fifty particular councils and many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers recommend to <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> "this great, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned doctor, this ardent lover of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, this incomparable director, this model of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Gospel". Statues have been raised to his memory at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Lyons; in the church of the Sorbonne his picture is the companion to that of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>.
<h2>Views as to the constitution of the Church: Council of Constance</h2>

<p>It is well known that what the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the early part of the fourteenth century lacked most, was a fixed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on what <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> today call the <em>Trait&eacute; de l'&Eacute;glise</em>. Gallicanism was born of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> principles, or rather of the temporary expedients believed to be a necessity amid the unfortunate events of the Great Schism. Extenuating circumstances can be pleaded in Gerson's favour. He had been instructed by men who were none too stable, and had made a close study of <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> genius of the fourteenth century. As we have seen, Gerson was generally more sensible and moderate in practice than in theory. Besides, it is now <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that several treatises, sometimes made the basis of an attack on his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, were not his at all ("De modis uniendi; octo conclusiones quarum dogmatizatio utilis videtur ad exterminationem moderni schismatis; Sermo factus in die Ascensionis", 1409, etc.). In fact his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or Gallican editors, von der Hardt, Richer, and Ellies-Dupin, have done his memory poor service by exaggerating or envenoming some of his propositions. It is but too <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the council, the chancellor maintained <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> theories which were censurable and later condemned. In his opinion the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> is not the universal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possessing immediate power over all the faithful; his power is only subjective and executive ("Opp. Gersonii", II, 259, 279). Far from being <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, he can even sometimes fall into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, in which event, if he still remain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are empowered to bind him, imprison him and even throw him into the sea (Ibid., 221; No&#235;l Valois, IV, 84). Gerson's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the general council is no sounder. He admits the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the &aelig;cumenical council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as he sees no other means of emerging from <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and returning to unity. With him temporary expedients become principles. It is what might be called <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> opportunism. Gerson is exclusively rational and practical, and the object of all his argumentation is the justification of the most extraordinary methods of procedure in order to attain the final result desired by him and by all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Hence, according to him, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> is amenable to the council which may correct and even depose him ("Opp. Gersonii", II, 201).

<p>Regarding the convocation and composition of this assembly he declares, with d'Ailly, that the first four &aelig;cumenical councils were not convened by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and that not only <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, but princes, and in fact any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, can convoke a council for the election of a single and universally acknowledged <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ("De auferibilitate pap&aelig;", in Opp. Gersonii, II, 209 sqq.). He also maintains that <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> may be summoned to such an assembly and may have a deliberate voice as well as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ("De potestate ecclesiastica", in ibid., II, 249). None of the faithful should be excluded (ibid., II, 205). In all of these propositions is seen, as it were, a reflection of the extreme theses of the revolutionary <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a>. Moreover, Gerson's attitude in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> was in conformity with his principles. With the delegates from the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, he demanded that all three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> immediately tender their resignation (Feb., 1415). A convinced partisan of the superiority of <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> over <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he insisted, like d'Ailly, that the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of canon and even of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> should have a voice in the deliberations of the council. This was in consequence of his democratic tendencies (cf. Salembier, Le grand schisme, 212, 299). He exalted to excess the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> of the general council and pursued <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">Pope John XXIII</a> with unflagging energy (Schwab, op. cit., 507; von der Hardt, II, 265). He voted for the four famous articles of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> (March 1415) which are the code of Gallicanism and pave the way for all the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> decisions of the assembly of 1682. Besides, he bodily maintained that these revolutionary principles were <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and wanted them carved on the stone of all the churches (Opp. Gersonii, II, 275). However in 1416 he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to admit with sadness that voices were still raised in denial of the superiority of the council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Gerson attributed this "condemnable" obstinancy to the necessity of sycophancy, calling it "a deadly poison with which the organism of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is impregnated to the very marrow" (Ibid, II, 247). It is because of these openly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> principles that Gerson, like d'Ailly, his master, passed for a precursor of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. It is also for this reason that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers, such as A. Jepp and Winklemann, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02674b.htm">de Bonnechose</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, compared him to <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a>. What has gone before, however, proves that these comparisons do Gerson <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.
<h2>Gerson's mystical theology and oratory</h2>

<p>Gerson's <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a> has its own peculiar and original character; it is that of an eminent and almost impeccable master. First of all he distinguishes it from scientific <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> which is abstract and discursive. His <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> in its essence is an experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, one perceives in himself. If the inferior powers remain in darkness, the superior faculties, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and especially pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, have the freer play, and therefore constitute a sublime state of transport which surpasses all theoretical learning. This <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> does not require great scientific attainments, it is within the reach of the most simple. Moreover, through close union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it gives us perfect contentment of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the entire and definitive appeasement of our desires (cf. Schwab, op. cit., 325; Ellies- Dupin, "Opp. Gersonii", I, clv). Gerson further distinguishes a practical part in his <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a> and lays down the conditions and means (<em>industri&aelig;</em>) preparatory to contemplation. These <em>industri&aelig;</em> are as follows: (1) to await the call of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; (2) to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well one's own temperament; (3) to be heedful of one's vocation and one's state; (4) to aim constantly towards greater perfection; (5) to avoid as much as possible a multiplicity of occupations and, in any event, not to become absorbed in them; (6) to set aside all vain desire for learning, i.e. all idle curiosity; (7) to remain calm and practise patience; (8) to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the origin of the affections and passions; (9) to choose the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> time and place; (10) to avoid extremes, either of abstinence or excess, in sleeping and eating; (11) to indulge in thoughts that excite <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> affections; (12) to banish from one's mind all images, which is pre&#235;minently <em>modus simplificandi cor in meditationibus</em> and <em>producendi contemplationem</em>. Gerson's many treatises are in Vol. III of his works. He was one of the first to recognize and proclaim the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> vocation of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>. He laboured diligently to promote <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> and St. Joseph and even dedicated to this saint a poem of 4600 lines entitled "Josephina". He was not the author of the "Imitation of Jesus Christ", and the reasons for this adverse opinion advanced by Rosweyde, Amort, Malou, Funk and Vacandard, seem convincing.

<p>He was one of the most eminent orators of his time and preached frequently, either in French or Latin, before the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, at court, in the principal churches of the capital or in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Saint-Jean-en-Gr&#232;ve. It was in this <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> that he preached the most of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> in French; these discourses, sixty-four in number, have been specially studied by the Abb&eacute; Bournet, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In plan these instructions are almost the same as modern sermons but Gerson's learning is often deficient in taste and judgment, and he makes sometimes too pompous a display of incongruous quotations. From the point of view of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he treats, for the greater part, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> subjects and inveighs against intemperance and the dissoluteness of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. He labours mainly for reform within, frequently exhorts to penance, and threatens his flock with the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgments of God</a>, but does not leave them without words of hope and consolation. His style is far from uniform and differs according to his hearers. Cold and accurate in the setting forth of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, he most frequently stirs the passions and resorts largely to allegory and word-painting; his language, although having all the piquancy, na&#239;vet&eacute;, and originality of the old French chronicles, is always dignified and becoming.

<p>Gerson's works were published directly after the introduction of printing, first at Cologne in 1483 (4 vols. in fol., for details consult Schwab, op. cit. <em>ad finem</em>). Both French editions, the one by Richer (Paris, 1635, 4 vols.), the other by Ellies-Dupin (Antwerp, or rather Amsterdam, 1703, 5 vols. in fol.) were prepared under the influence of Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and with a view to religious polemics. They were hastily and confusedly compiled without any great care and contain serious defects. However, the one by Ellies-Dupin is fairly complete and the first four volumes embody over 400 of Gerson's treatises. The references to Gerson's works in this article are to this edition.
