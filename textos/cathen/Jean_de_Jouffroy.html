<h1>Jean de Jouffroy</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and statesman; b. at <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a> (Franche-Comt&eacute;) about 1412; d. at the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Rulli, in the <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Diocese of Bourges</a>, 24 November, 1473. After studying at D&ocirc;le, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and Pavia, he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, and taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law at Pavia (1435-38). Philip the Good, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, entrusted him with several diplomatic missions to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Luxeuil (1450 or 1451) and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> (1453), he became a favorite of the Dauphin, later King Louis XI.

<p>Through the intervention of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Jouffroy had tried to obtain the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, and he soon found an opportunity of attaining this end. The <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> (1438), besides asserting the superiority of councils over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, had lessened the freedom and independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and had, to a great extent, withdrawn it from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> control. While yet Dauphin, Louis XI had pledged himself to abolish the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> in the event of his succession to the throne. Upon his becoming king (1461), negotiations were opened by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, who appointed Jouffroy as his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. The king showed himself favorably disposed, but, in return, expected that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would change his <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> policy, cease to support Ferrante, and recognize John of Calabria as King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, Jouffroy made no mention of this fact, and simply announced the king's intention of repealing the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>. In fact Louis himself wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (27 Nov., 1461): "As you require, we set aside and proscribe the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> in our whole kingdom, in Dauphine, and all our dominions, in which henceforth your <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> shall be unquestioned." Louis had expressed the desire that Jouffroy be made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Notwithstanding the opposition of many in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> consented, and on 18 Dec., 1461, Jouffroy was one of the seven newly appointed <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. In the beginning of January, 1462, Jouffroy made known to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the king's demands concerning <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. In his memoirs <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> complains that "after Jouffroy had entered the sure haven of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, he brought forward that which he had hitherto concealed, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> would certainly be repealed only when the king's wishes regarding <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> had been complied with." For some time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> seemed to be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether it would not be advisable to yield, but finally refused, and Louis XI, disappointed in his hopes and anticipations, became enraged against the pontiff, Jouffroy himself encouraging him in his opposition. The consequence was that, without directly re-establishing the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>, the king issued many decrees which practically did away with the concessions made by its revocation. Jouffroy's role in the whole affair is far from praiseworthy, and, in his memoirs, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> accuses him of deception, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> representations, and treachery. Pastor's judgment seems to be fully justified: "King Louis and Cardinal Jouffroy were a well matched pair."

<p>Jouffroy became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a> (10 Dec., 1462) and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Denis (1464). Several times he was sent by the king as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He accompanied the expedition against the Duke of Armagnac besieged in Lectoure, but it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he took any part in the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the duke. Falling sick, he stopped at Rulli where he died. Jouffroy was a good orator, and his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> were published in D'Ach&eacute;ry's "Spicilegium" (Paris, 1666). He was also a shrewd diplomat, but was not free from selfishness and <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, which led him to use unfair means in the pursuit of his own ends.
