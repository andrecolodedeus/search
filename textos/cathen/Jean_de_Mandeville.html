<h1>Jean de Mandeville</h1>  

<p>(MAUNDEVILLE, MONTEVILLA)

<p>The author of a book of travels much read in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, died probably in 1372. The writer describes himself as an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> born at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>. In 1322, on the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>, he set out on a journey that took him first to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> where he participated as mercenary in the sultan's <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the Bedouins. He next visited Palestine, then, by way of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, also the interior of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and served for fifteen months in the army of the Great Khan of <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>. After an absence of thirty-four years he returned in 1356, and at the instance and with the help of a physician, whose acquaintance he had made in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> at the court of the sultan, he wrote in L&uuml;ttich an account of his experiences and observations. In the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> 1372 is given as the year of his death. Later investigation, however, made it clear that the real author was Jean de Bourgoigne, or &agrave; la Barbe, a physician from L&uuml;ttich, to whom several <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> works are also attributed. He really lived for some time in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and during his sojourn may have conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of describing a journey to the Orient. Having visited no foreign country except <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he was compelled to make use of the descriptions of others and to publish his compilation under a pseudonym. He discloses, in the situations borrowed often word for word from various authors, an extraordinarily wide range of reading, and he understood how to present his matter so attractively that the work in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and print had a wonderful popularity.

<p>His chief sources are the accounts of the travels of the first missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> orders (see <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">GEOGRAPHY AND THE CHURCH</a>), who were the first to venture into the interior of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. He describes Constantinople and Palestine almost entirely according to the "Itinerarius" of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> William of Boldensele written in 1336; he made use moreover of the "Tractatus de distantiis locorum terr&aelig; sanct&aelig;" of Eugesippus, the "Descriptio terr&aelig; sanct&aelig;" of John of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (c. 1165), and the "Libellus de locis sanctis" of Theodoricus (c. 1172). He was able out of his own experiences to give particulars about <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. What he has to say about the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> is taken from the work "De statu Saracenarum" (1273) of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> William of <a href="../cathen/15060a.htm">Tripolis</a>. His account of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, etc., is borrowed from the "Historia orientalis" of Hayton, the former Prince of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. For the country of the Tatars and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> he made use almost word for word of the "Deseriptio orientalium" of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12281a.htm">Odoric of Pordenone</a>, and in parts of the "Historia Mongolorum" of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> John of Plano Carpini. Apart from books of travels he plagiarised from works of a general nature, the old authors Pliny, Solinus, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus Flavius</a>, and the comprehensive "Speculum Historiale" of <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a>. The numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and printed editions are enumerated by R&ouml;hricht ("Bibliotheca Geographica Palestin&aelig;", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1890, pp. 79-85). The oldest impressions are: in French (Lyons, 1480); German (Augsburg, 1481, 1482); English (Westminster, 1499). Modern editions: "The voinge and travaile of Sir Mandeville", with introd. by J. O. Halliwell (London, 1839); "The Buke of John Maundeuill", ed. by G. F. Warner (Westminster, 1889), in Roxburghe Club, Publications, No. 30; "Travels of Mandeville. The Version of the Cotton Manuscript in Modern Spelling" (London, 1900).
