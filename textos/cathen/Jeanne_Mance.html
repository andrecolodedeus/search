<h1>Jeanne Mance</h1>  

<p>Foundress of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, and one of the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> settlers in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, b. at Nogent-le-Roi, Champagne, 1606; d. at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 19 June, 1673. Born of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who belonged to the magistracy, she lived with her father, Pierre Mance, <em>procureur du roi</em> (king's attorney) until his death in 1640. In this year she met M. de la Dauversiere, who, with <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, was actively interested in the foundation of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. For the first time Mlle Mance heard of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a> (Canada) and of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were going there to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to the spreading of the Faith. She embarked at <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> in June, 1641, with Pere Laplace, a dozen men, and a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> young Dieppe <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. The following (probably 24) August she reached Quebec, and devoted herself during the entire winter to the care of the settlers. They wished to retain her at Quebec, but on 8 May, 1642, she went up the river with <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">M. de Maisonneuve</a> and her early companions, and reached <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> on 17 May. It was she who decorated the altar on which the first Mass was said in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (18 May, 1642). The same year she founded a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in her own home, a very <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> one, into which she received the sick, settlers or natives. Two years later (1644) she opened a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in Rue St-Paul, which cost 6000 francs &mdash; a gift of <a href="../cathen/03052a.htm">Mme de Bullion</a> to Jeanne on her departure for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> &mdash; and stood for fifty years. For seventeen years she had sole care of this <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.

<p>In 1650 she visited <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the interests of the colony, and brought back 22,000 livres of the 60,000 set apart by <a href="../cathen/03052a.htm">Mme de Bullion</a> for the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. On her return to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, finding that without reinforcements the colonists must succumb under the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and the many hardships of their position, she lent the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> money to <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">M. de Maisonneuve</a>, who proceeded to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and organized a band of one hundred men for the defense of the colony. In 1659 Jeanne made a second trip to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to secure religious to assist her in her work. She had for twenty months been suffering from a fractured wrist badly reduced, but in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at Saint-Sulpice where <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier's</a> heart was preserved, she was suddenly cured (2 Feb., 1659) She was so fortunate as to secure three Hospital <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La Fleche in Anjou, Judith Moreau de Bresoles, Catherine Mace, and Marie Maillet. They had a rough passage and the plague broke out on board. On their arrival Mgr. de Laval vainly tried to retain the three sisters at Quebec in the community of the Hospital Sisters of St. Augustine. Every obstacle having been overcome they reached <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> on 17 or 18 October. Jeanne's good work being now fully established, she lived henceforth a more retired life. On her death after a long and painful illness, she was buried in the church of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, the burning of which in 1696 destroyed at once the remains of the noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the house that she had built. Her work, however, was continued, and two centuries later (1861) the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was transferred to the foot of Mount Royal, on the slope which overlooks the city and the river. The H&ocirc;tel-Dieu still flourishes, and in 1909 the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of the first three Hospital Sisters (1659) was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> celebrated. On the initiative of Mgr. Bruch&eacute;si, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, a fine monument in bronze on a granite base, by the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Philip H&eacute;bert, representing "Jeanne Mance soignant un colon bless&eacute;", has been decided on. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> contains more than 300 beds. It is estimated that the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> cared for 82,000 patients between 1760 (date on which <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was ceded to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>) and 1860; 128,000 patients have been received between 1860 and 1910. A street and a public park in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> bear the name of Mance.
