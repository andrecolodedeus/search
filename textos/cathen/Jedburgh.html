<h1>Jedburgh</h1>  

<p>(Eighty-two different spellings of the name are given in the "Origines Parochiales Scoti&aelig;").

<p>Augustinian <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, in the town of the same name (capital of Roxburghshire, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>), established as a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> by David I, King of Scots, in 1118, and colonized by <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> from the Abbey of St-Quentin, at <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Fordun gives 1147 as the year of foundation, but this seems to have been the date of the erection of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, when <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> Osbert (styled in the <a href="../cathen/10170a.htm">Melrose</a> chronicle "primus abbas de Geddeworth") was raised to the abbatial dignity. Jedburgh soon became one of the greatest Scottish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, deriving importance from its proximity to the castle (now entirely destroyed), which was the favourite residence of many of the Scottish kings. Lands, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, houses, and valuable fisheries, on both sides of the border, were bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by David I, Malcolm IV, William the Lion, and other royal and noble benefactors; and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> chose to be married in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church to Yolande de Dreux in 1285, by which year the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> buildings, including the great church, were probably complete.

<p>An opulent <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> so near the English border as Jedburgh was sure to suffer much in the constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. About 1300 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became uninhabitable, owing to repeated attacks made on it, and the community was dispersed. Later on it recovered its prosperity for a time, but in the century and a half preceding the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> it was devastated, plundered, and occasionally set on fire, at least four times by the invading English. In 1559 (John Horne being <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>) the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was suppressed, and its possessions confiscated by the Crown. A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church was afterwards constructed within the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and used until 1875, when a new church was built by the Marquess of Lothian, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> has possessed the lordship of Jedburgh continuously since 1622. Practically the whole of the domestic buildings of Jedburgh Abbey have disappeared; but the magnificent church is still wonderfully entire. The oldest part is the early Norman choir, of which the two western bays remain; and the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, 129 feet long, is a very stately and impressive example of Early English work. The decorated north <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> (fourteenth century) is the burial-place of the Kers of Fernihurst, now represented by the Marquess of Lothian. The massive central tower is still quite perfect. The total length of the church (inside) is 218 feet.
