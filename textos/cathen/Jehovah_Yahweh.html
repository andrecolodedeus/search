<h1>Jehovah (Yahweh)</h1>  

<p>The proper name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> called it <em>the name</em> by excellence, the great name, the only name, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and terrible name, the hidden and mysterious name, the name of the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, the proper name, and most frequently <em>shem hammephorash</em>, i.e. the explicit or the separated name, though the precise meaning of this last expression is a matter of discussion (cf. Buxtorf, "Lexicon", Basle, 1639, col. 2432 sqq.).

<p>Jehovah occurs more frequently than any other Divine name. The <a href="../cathen/04195a.htm">Concordances</a> of Furst ("Vet. Test. Concordantiae", Leipzig, 1840) and Mandelkern ("Vet. Test. Concordantiae", Leipzig, 1896) do not exactly agree as to the number of its occurrences; but in round numbers it is found in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> 6000 times, either alone or in conjunction with another Divine name. The <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> render the name generally by "Lord" (<em>Kyrios, Dominus</em>), a translation of <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a> &mdash; usually substituted for Jehovah in reading.
<h2 id="section1">Pronunciation of Jehovah</h2>

<p>The Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinic</a> writers agree in representing Jehovah as an ineffable name. As to the Fathers, we only need draw attention to the following expressions: <em>onoma arreton, aphraston, alekton, aphthegkton, anekphoneton, aporreton kai hrethenai me dynamenon, mystikon</em>. Leusden could not induce a certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, in spite of his poverty, to pronounce the real name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though he held out the most alluring promises. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew's</a> compliance with Leusden's wishes would not indeed have been of any real advantage to the latter; for the modern <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are as uncertain of the real pronunciation of the Sacred name as their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> contemporaries. According to a <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinic</a> tradition the real pronunciation of Jehovah ceased to be used at the time of Simeon the Just, who was, according to <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>, a contemporary of Alexander the Great. At any rate, it appears that the name was no longer pronounced after the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>. The Mishna refers to our question more than once: Berachoth, ix, 5, allows the use of the Divine name by way of salutation; in Sanhedrin, x, 1, Abba Shaul refuses any share in the future world to those who pronounce it as it is written; according to Thamid, vii, 2, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> (or perhaps in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) might employ the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine name, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the country (outside <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) had to be contented with the name <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a>; according to <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a> ("More Neb.", i, 61, and "Yad chasaka", xiv, 10) the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine name was used only by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13431a.htm">sanctuary</a> who imparted the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02054a.htm">Day of Atonement</a>. Phil ["De mut. nom.", n. 2 (ed. Marg., i, 580); "Vita Mos.", iii, 25 (ii, 166)] seems to maintain that even on these occasions the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had to speak in a low voice. Thus far we have followed the post-Christian Jewish tradition concerning the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> before Simeon the Just.

<p>As to the earlier tradition, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq., II, xii, 4) declares that he is not allowed to treat of the Divine name; in another place (Antiq., XII, v, 5) he says that the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> erected on Mt. Garizim an <em>anonymon ieron</em>. This extreme veneration for the Divine name must have generally prevailed at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a> was made, for the translators always substitute <em>Kyrios</em> (Lord) for Jehovah. <a href="../bible/sir023.htm#vrs10">Ecclesiasticus 23:10</a>, appears to prohibit only a wanton use of the Divine name, though it cannot be denied that Jehovah is not employed as frequently in the more recent canonical books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as in the older books.

<p>It would be hard to determine at what <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> this reverence for the Divine name originated among the Hebrews. <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinic</a> writers derive the prohibition of pronouncing the <em>Tetragrammaton</em>, as the name of Jehovah is called, from <a href="../bible/lev024.htm#vrs16">Leviticus 24:16</a>: "And he that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemeth</a> the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, dying let him die". The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> participle <em>noqedh</em>, here rendered "blasphemeth", is translated <em>honomazon</em> in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, and appears to have the meaning "to determine", "to denote" (by means of its proper vowels) in <a href="../bible/gen030.htm#vrs28">Genesis 30:28</a>; <a href="../bible/num001.htm#vrs17">Numbers 1:17</a>; <a href="../bible/isa062.htm#vrs2">Isaiah 62:2</a>. Still, the context of <a href="../bible/lev024.htm#vrs16">Leviticus 24:16</a> (cf. verses <a href="../bible/lev024.htm#vrs11">11</a> and <a href="../bible/lev024.htm#vrs15">15</a>), favours the meaning <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">"to blaspheme"</a>. <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> derive the prohibition also from <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs15">Exodus 3:15</a>; but this argument cannot stand the test of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of sober <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a> (cf. Drusius, "Tetragrammaton", 8-10, in "Critici Sacri", Amsterdam, 1698, I, p. ii, col. 339-42; "De nomine divino", ibid., 512-16; <a href="../cathen/05152a.htm">Drach</a>, "Harmonic entre l'&Eacute;glise et la Synagogue", I, Paris, 1844, pp. 350-53, and Note 30, pp. 512-16).

<p>What has been said explains the so-called <em>qeri perpetuum</em>, according to which the consonants of Jehovah are always accompanied in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> text by the vowels of <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a> except in the cases in which <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a> stands in apposition to Jehovah: in these cases the vowels of <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Elohim</a> are substituted. The use of a simple shewa in the first syllable of Jehovah, instead of the compound shewa in the corresponding syllable of <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a> and <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Elohim</a>, is required by the rules of <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> grammar governing the use of shewa. Hence the question: What are the true vowels of the word Jehovah?

<p>It has been maintained by some recent scholars that the word Jehovah dates only from the year 1520 (cf. Hastings, "Dictionary of the Bible", II, 1899, p. 199: Gesenius-Buhl, "Handw&ouml;rterbuch", 13th ed., 1899, p. 311). Drusius (loc. cit., 344) represents Peter Galatinus as the inventor of the word Jehovah, and Fagius as it propagator in the world of scholars and commentators. But the writers of the sixteenth century, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (e.g. Cajetan and Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze), are perfectly familiar with the word. Galatinus himself ("Areana cathol. veritatis", I, Bari, 1516, a, p. 77) represents the form as known and received in his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Besides, Drusius (loc. cit., 351) discovered it in Porchetus, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of the fourteenth century. Finally, the word is found even in the "Pugio fidei" of Raymund Martin, a work written about 1270 (ed. Paris, 1651, pt. III, dist. ii, cap. iii, p. 448, and Note, p. 745). Probably the introduction of the name Jehovah antedates even R. Martin.

<p>No wonder then that this form has been regarded as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pronunciation of the Divine name by such scholars as Michaelis ("Supplementa ad lexica hebraica", I, 1792, p. 524), <a href="../cathen/05152a.htm">Drach</a> (loc. cit., I, 469-98), Stier (Lehrgeb&auml;ude der hebr. Sprache, 327), and others. <ul><li>Jehovah is composed of the abbreviated forms of the imperfect, the participle, and the perfect of the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> verb "to be" (<em>ye=yehi; ho=howeh; wa=hawah</em>). According to this explanation, the meaning of Jehovah would be "he who will be, is, and has been". But such a word-formation has no <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew language</a>. <li>The abbreviated form <em>Jeho</em> supposes the full form Jehovah. But the form Jehovah cannot account for the abbreviations <em>Jahu</em> and <em>Jah</em>, while the abbreviation <em>Jeho</em> may be derived from another word. <li>The Divine name is said to be paraphrased in <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs4">Apocalypse 1:4</a>, and <a href="../bible/rev004.htm#vrs8">4:8</a>, by the expression <em>ho on kai ho en kai ho erchomenos</em>, in which <em>ho erchomenos</em> is regard as equivalent to <em>ho eromenos</em>, "the one that will be"; but it really means "the coming one", so that after the coming of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>, <a href="../bible/rev011.htm#vrs17">Apocalypse 11:17</a>, retains only <em>ho on kai ho en</em>. <li>the comparison of Jehovah with the Latin <em>Jupiter, Jovis</em>. But it wholly neglects the fuller forms of the Latin names <em>Diespiter, Diovis</em>. Any connection of Jehovah with the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Divine name consisting of the seven Greek vowels has been rejected by Hengstenberg (Beitrage zur Einleiung ins Alte Testament, II, 204 sqq.) and Tholuck (Vermischte Schriften, I, 349 sqq.).</ul>



<p>To take up the ancient writers: <ul><li>Diodorus Siculus writes <em>Jao</em> (I, 94); <li><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103235.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> II.35.3</a>), <em>Jaoth</em>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (Irenaeus, <a href="../fathers/0103104.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.4.1</a>), <em>Jao</em>; <li><a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02105.htm"><em>Stromata</em> V.6</a>), <em>Jaou</em>; <li><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/101502.htm"><em>Commentary on John</em> II.1</a>), <em>Jao</em>; <li>Porphyry (Eusebius, "Praep. evang", I, ix, in P.G., XXI, col. 72), <em>Jeuo</em>; <li>Epiphanius (<a href="../fathers/0103103.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.3.40</a>), <em>Ja</em> or <em>Jabe</em>; <li>Pseudo-Jerome ("Breviarium in Pss.", in P.L., XXVI, 828), <em>Jaho</em>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> (<a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, in "Ex. quaest.", xv, in P.G., LXXX, col. 244), <em>Jabe</em>; <li><a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> (cf. Lamy, "La science catholique", 1891, p. 196), <em>Jehjeh</em>; <li><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/3001025.htm">Epistle 25</a>) speaks of certain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> Greek writers who transcribed the Hebrew Divine name II I II I.</ul> The judicious reader will perceive that the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> pronunciation <em>Jabe</em> probably approaches the real sound of the Divine name closest; the other early writers transmit only abbreviations or corruptions of the sacred name. Inserting the vowels of <em>Jabe</em> into the original Hebrew consonant text, we obtain the form Jahveh (<em>Yahweh</em>), which has been generally accepted by modern scholars as the true pronunciation of the Divine name. It is not merely closely connected with the pronunciation of the ancient <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> by means of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> tradition, but it also allows the legitimate derivation of all the abbreviations of the sacred name in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Meaning of the Divine Name</h2>

<p>Jahveh (Yahweh) is one of the archaic Hebrew nouns, such as <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, Joseph, Israel, etc. (cf. Ewald, "Lehrbuch der hebr. Sprache", 7th ed., 1863, p. 664), derived from the third person imperfect in such a way as to attribute to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or a thing the action of the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> expressed by the verb after the manner of a verbal adjective or a participle. Furst has collected most of these nouns, and calls the form <em>forma participialis imperfectiva.</em> As the Divine name is an imperfect form of the archaic Hebrew verb "to be", Jahveh means "He Who is", Whose characteristic note consists in being, or <em>The Being</em> simply.

<p>Here we are confronted with the question, whether Jahveh is the imperfect <em>hiphil</em> or the imperfect <em>qal</em>. <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> and Le Clere believe that the Divine name is a hiphil form; hence it signifies, according to Schrader (Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd ed., p. 25), He Who brings into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, the Creator; and according to Lagarde (Psalterium Hieronymi, 153), He Who causes to arrive, Who realizes His <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Providence. But this opinion is not in keeping with <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs14">Exodus 3:14</a>, nor is there any trace in Hebrew of a hiphil form of the verb meaning "to be"; moreover, this hiphil form is supplied in the cognate languages by the pi'el form, except in <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> where the hiphil is rare and of late occurrence.

<p>On the other hand, Jehveh may be an imperfect <em>qal</em> from a grammatical point of view, and the traditional <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs6">Exodus 3:6-16</a>, seems to necessitate the form Jahveh. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> asks <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "If they should say to me: What is his [<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>] name? What shall I say to them?" In reply, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> returns three times to the determination of His name.

<p>First, He uses the first person imperfect of the Hebrew verb "to be"; here the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, <a href="../cathen/01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, Theodotion, and the Arabic version suppose that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uses the imperfect <em>qal</em>; only the <a href="../cathen/14454b.htm">Targums</a> of Jonathan and of Jerusalem imply the imperfect <em>hiphil</em>. Hence we have the renderings: "I am who am" (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>), "I am who is" (Septuagint), "I shall be [who] shall be" (Aquila, Theodotion), "the Eternal who does not cease" (Ar.); only the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/14454b.htm">Targums</a> see any reference to the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of the world.

<p>The second time, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uses again the first person imperfect of the Hebrew verb "to be"; here the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a>, the Samaritan, the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> versions, and the <a href="../cathen/14454b.htm">Targums</a> of Onkelos and Jerusalem retain the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, so that one cannot tell whether they regard the imperfect as a <em>qal</em> or a <em>hiphil</em> form; the Arabic version omits the whole clause; but the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14454b.htm">Targum</a> of Jonathan suppose here the imperfect <em>qal</em>: "He Who Is, hath sent me to you" instead of "I Am, hath sent me to you: (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>); "<em>ho on</em> sent me to you" (Septuagint); "I am who am, and who shall be, hath sent me to you" (Targ. Jon.).

<p>Finally, the third time, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uses the third person of the imperfect, or the form of the sacred name itself; here the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> version and the <a href="../cathen/14454b.htm">Targum</a> of Onkelos retain the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> form; the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> version render "Lord", though, according to the <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> of the former two passages, they should have translated, "He Is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers, . . . hath sent me to you"; the Arabic version substitutes "God". Classical <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, therefore, regards Jahveh as the imperfect <em>qal</em> of the Hebrew verb "to be".

<p>Here another question presents itself: Is the being predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His name, the <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> being denoting nothing but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> itself, or is it an historical being, a passing manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>?

<p>Most <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers regard the being implied in the name Jahveh as an historical one, though some do not wholly exclude such <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> independence, absolute constancy, and fidelity to His promises, and immutability in His plans (cf. Driver, "Hebrew Tenses", 1892, p. 17). The following are the reasons alleged for the historical meaning of the "being" implied in the Divine name: <ul> <li>The <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> sense of being was too abstruse a concept for the primitive times. Still, some of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> speculations of the early times are almost as abstruse; besides, it was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should fully understand the meaning implied in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name. The scientific development of its sense might be left to the future <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>.
<li>The Hebrew verb <em>hayah</em> means rather "to become" than "to be" permanently. But good authorities deny that the Hebrew verb denotes being in motion rather than being in a permanent condition. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the participle would have expressed a permanent state more clearly; but then, the participle of the verb <em>hayah</em> is found only in <a href="../bible/exo009.htm#vrs3">Exodus 9:3</a>, and few proper names in Hebrew are derived from the participle. <li>The imperfect mainly expresses the action of one who enters anew on the scene. But this is not always the case; the Hebrew imperfect is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> aorist, prescinding from <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and, therefore, best adapted for general principles (Driver, p. 38). <li>"I am who am" appears to refer to "I will be with thee" of <a href="../bible/exo009.htm#vrs12">verse 12</a>; both texts seems to be alluded to in <a href="../bible/hos001.htm#vrs9">Hosea 1:9</a>, "I will not be yours". But if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, "I am who am" must be considered as an ellipse: "I am who am with you", or "I am who am faithful to my promises". This is harsh enough; but it becomes quite inadmissible in the clause, "I am who am, hath sent me".</ul>

<p>Since then the Hebrew imperfect is admittedly not to be considered as a future, and since the nature of the language does not force us to see in it the expression of transition or of becoming, and since, moreover, early tradition is quite fixed and the absolute character of the verb <em>hayah</em> has induced even the most ardent patrons of its historical sense to admit in the texts a description of <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">God's nature</a>, the rules of <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a> urge us to take the expressions in <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs13">Exodus 3:13-15</a>, for what they are worth. Jahveh is He Who Is, i.e., His <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is best characterized by Being, if indeed it must be designated by a personal proper name distinct from the term <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Revue biblique, 1893, p. 338). The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> theories as to the depth of meaning latent in Yahveh (Yahweh) rest, therefore, on a solid foundation. Finite beings are defined by their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be defined only  by being, pure and simple, nothing less and nothing more; not be abstract being common to everything, and characteristic of nothing in particular, but by concrete being, absolute being, the ocean of all <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> being, independent of any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, incapable of change, exceeding all duration, because He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>: "<a href="../cathen/01332b.htm">Alpha and Omega</a>, the beginning and the end, . . . who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs8">Revelation 1:8</a>). Cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/1013.htm#article14">I.13.14</a>; <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, "De Deo Uno" (3rd ed., 1883, thesis XXIII, pp. 279-86.
<h2 id="section3">Origin of the name Jahveh (Yahweh)</h2>

<p>The opinion that the name Jahveh was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, has been defended by von Bohlen (Genesis, 1835, p. civ), Von der Alm (Theol. Briefe, I, 1862, pp. 524-27), Colenso (The Pentateuch, V, 1865, pp. 269-84), Goldziher (Der Mythus bei den Hebr&auml;ern, 1867, p. 327), but has been rejected by Kuenen ("De Godsdienst van Israel", I, Haarlem, 1869, pp. 379-401) and Baudissin (Studien, I, pp. 213-18). It is antecedently improbable that Jahveh, the irreconcilable enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, should be originally a <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> god.

<p>It has been said by Vatke (Die Religion des Alten Test., 1835, p. 672) and J.G. M&uuml;ller (Die Semiten in ihrem Verh&auml;ltniss zu Chamiten und Japhetiten, 1872, p. 163) that the name Jahveh is of Indo-European origin. But the transition of the Sanscrit root, <em>div</em>&mdash;the Latin <em>Jupiter-Jovis</em> (<em>Diovis</em>), the Greek <em>Zeus-Dios</em>, the Indo-European <em>Dyaus</em> into the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> form Jahveh has never been satisfactorily explained. Hitzig's contention (Vorlesungen &uuml;ber bibl. Theol., p. 38) that the Indo-Europeans furnished at least the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> contained in the name Jahveh, even if they did not originate the name itself, is without any value.

<p>The theory that Jahveh is of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin may have a certain amount of <em>a priori</em> probability, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Still, the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> are not convincing:

<ul><li>R&ouml;th (Die Aegypt. und die Zoroastr. Glaubenslehre, 1846, p. 175) derives the <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">Hebrew name</a> from the ancient moon-god <em>Ih</em> or <em>Ioh</em>. But there is no connection between the Hebrew Jahveh and the moon (cf. Pierret, "Vocabul. Hi&eacute;rogl.", 1875, p. 44).
<li>Plutarch (De Iside, 9) tells us that a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Athene (Neith) in Sais bore the inscription: "I am all that has been, is, and will be". But Tholuck (op. cit., 1867, pp. 189-205) shows that the meaning of this inscription is wholly different from that of the name Jahveh.
<li>The patrons of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin of the sacred name appeal to the common <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> formula, <em>Nuk pu nuk</em> but though its literal signification is "I am I", its real meaning is "It is I who" (cf. Le Page Renouf, "Hibbert Lectures for 1879", p. 244).</ul>

<p>As to the theory that Jahveh has a Chaldean or an Accadian origin, its foundation is not very solid: <ul>
<li>Jahveh is said to be a merely artificial form introduced to put meaning into the name of the national god (Delitzsch, "Wo lag das Paradies", 1881, pp. 158-64); the common and popular name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is said to have been <em>Yahu</em> or <em>Yah</em>, the letter <em>I</em> being the essential Divine element in the name. The contention, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the Chaldean or Accadian origin of the Hebrew Divine name; besides the form Yah is rare and exclusively poetic; Yahu never appears in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, while the ordinary full form of the Divine name is found even in the inscription of <a href="../cathen/10210a.htm">Mesa</a> (line 18) dating from the ninth century B.C.
<li>Yahu and Yah were known outside <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the forms enter into the composition of foreign proper names; besides, the variation of the name of a certain King of Hammath shows that <em>Ilu</em> is equivalent to <em>Yau</em>, and that <em>Yau</em> is the name of a god (Schrader, "Bibl. Bl.", II, p. 42, 56; Sargon, "Cylinder", xxv; Keil, "Fastes", I. 33). But foreign proper names containing Yah or Yahu are extremely rare and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, and may be explained without admitting gods in foreign nations, bearing the sacred name. Again, the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> pantheon is fairly well known at present, but the god Yau does not appear in it.
<li>Among the pre-Semitic <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, <em>I</em> is a synonym of <em>Ilu</em>, the supreme god; now <em>I</em> with the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> nominative ending added becomes <em>Yau</em> (cf. Delitzsch, "Lesest&uuml;cke", 3rd ed., 1885, p. 42, Syllab. A, col. I, 13-16). Hommel (Altisrael. Ueberlieferung, 1897, pp. 144, 225) feels sure that he has discovered this Chaldean god Yau. It is the god who is represented ideographically (<em>ilu</em>) <em>A-a</em>, but ordinarily pronounced <em>Malik</em>, though the expression should be read <em>Ai</em> or <em>Ia</em> (<em>Ya</em>). The patriarchal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> employed this name, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> borrowed and transformed it. But Lagrange points out that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they offered their children to Jahveh, when they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> them to <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Malik</a> (Religion semitique, 1905, pp. 100 sqq.). <a href="../bible/jer032.htm#vrs35">Jeremiah 32:35</a>, and <a href="../bible/zep001.htm#vrs5">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, distinguish between <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Malik</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Hebrew God</a>.</ul>

<p>Cheyne (Traditions and Beliefs of Ancient Israel, 1907, pp. 63 sqq.) connects the origin of Jahveh with his <em>Yerahme'el</em> theory; but even the most advanced critics regard Cheyne's theory as a discredit to modern criticism. Other singular opinions as to the origin of the sacred name may be safely omitted. The view that Jahveh is of Hebrew origin is the most satisfactory. Arguing from <a href="../bible/exo006.htm#vrs2">Exodus 6:2-8</a>, such <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> as <a href="../cathen/11063a.htm">Nicholas of Lyra</a>, Tostatus, Cajetan, <a href="../cathen/02655c.htm">Bonfr&egrave;re</a>, etc., maintain that the name was revealed for the first time to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Horeb</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> declares in this vision that he "appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> . . . by the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a>; and my name <em><a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a></em> [Jahveh] I did not shew them". But the phrase "to appear by a name" does not necessarily imply the first <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of that name; it rather signifies the explanation of the name, or a manner of acting conformable to the meaning of the name (cf. Robion in "la Science cathol.", 1888, pp. 618-24; Delattre, ibid., 1892, pp. 673-87; van Kasteren, ibid., 1894, pp. 296-315; Robert in "Revue biblique", 1894, pp. 161-81). On <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mt. Horeb</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> told <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that He had not acted with the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarchs</a> as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Covenant, Jahveh, but as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a>.

<p>Perhaps it is preferable to say that the sacred name, though perhaps in a somewhat modified form, had been in use in the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. On <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mt. Horeb</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealed and explained the accurate form of His name, Jahveh. <ul><li>The sacred name occurs in Genesis about 156 times; this frequent occurrence can hardly be a mere prolepsis. <li><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs26">Genesis 4:26</a>, states that Enos "began to call upon the name of the Lord [Jahveh]", or as the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew text</a> suggests, "began to call himself after the name of Jahveh". <li>Jochabed, the mother of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, has in her name an abbreviated form Jo (Yo) of Jahveh. The pre-Mosaic existence of the Divine name among the Hebrews accounts for this fact more easily than the supposition that the Divine element was introduced after the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the name. <li>Among the 163 proper names which bear an element of the sacred name in their composition, 48 have <em>yeho</em> or <em>yo</em> at the beginning, and 115 have <em>yahu</em> or <em>yah</em> and the end, while the form Jahveh never occurs in any such composition. Perhaps it might be assumed that these shortened forms <em>yeho, yo, yahu, yah</em>, represent the Divine name as it existed among the Israelites before the full name Jahveh was revealed on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mt. Horeb</a>. On the other hand, Driver (Studia biblica, I, 5) has shown that these short forms are the regular abbreviations of the full name. At any rate, while it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> revealed His sacred name to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for the first time, He surely <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mt. Horeb</a> that Jahveh is His incommunicable name, and explained its meaning.</ul>
