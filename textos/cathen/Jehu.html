<h1>Jehu</h1>  

<p>The derivation of the name is uncertain. By some it is translated "Yahweh is he".

<p>I. J<font size=-2>EHU</font> (Sept. 'Io&uacute;), a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, described in <a href="../bible/1ki016.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 16:1</a>, as the son of Hanani, and as <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesying</a> against Baasa, the then reigning King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Hanani is probably to be identified with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of that name mentioned in <a href="../bible/2ch016.htm#vrs7">2 Chronicles 16:7</a>. It is uncertain whether Jehu belonged to the Southern or Northern Kingdom, but, at all events, his ministry seems to have been exercised chiefly in the latter. He appears later in the reign of Josaphat, King of Juda, whom he reproaches for his alliance with Achab (cf. <a href="../bible/2ch019.htm#vrs2">2 Chronicles 19:2-3</a>). He outlived Josaphat, and wrote the history of his reign (<a href="../bible/2ch020.htm#vrs34">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>).

<p>II. J<font size=-2>EHU,</font>, the tenth King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, 884 to 856, or 865 to 828, son of Josaphat, son of Namsi; his tribe is not mentioned. According to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq., IX, vi, 1) he was chief commandant of the army of Joram, his predecessor. For his sudden elevation to the royal power and his bloody reign see <a href="../bible/2ki009.htm">2 Kings 9</a>, <a href="../bible/2ki010.htm">10</a>. The Prophet Elias had previously received a command from the Lord to anoint Jehu king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#vrs16">1 Kings 19:16</a>), but the order was only carried out by Eliseus, his successor. While Joram, King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, was still convalescing in Jezrahel from a wound, Eliseus sent "one of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>" to Jehu's head-quarters in Ramoth Galaad with orders to anoint him king and announce to him his mission of Divine vengeance against the wicked house of Achab. Jehu was immediately acclaimed king by his brother officers, and he forthwith set out in his chariot with his followers for Jezrahel, where Ozochias, King of Juda, was visiting his ally Joram. They fled, but Joram was killed by an arrow from the bow of Jehu, and Ozochias, being mortally wounded, died shortly after in <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>. Entering the town of Jezrahel, Jehu perceived the <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Queen Jezabel</a> at a window of her palace, and he bade her attendants to cast her down headlong and she was trampled under the hoofs of the horses (<a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#vrs23">1 Kings 21:23</a>). Consistently with his programme of vengeance, Jehu caused the seventy sons of Achab who resided in Samaria to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and likewise all of the chief men and friends and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the house of Achab, as well as forty-two men of the brethren of Ozochias. He abolished the worship of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> and slew its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and followers, but he maintained the worship of the golden calves erected by Jeroboam. He was commended by <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> for his conduct towards the house of Achab, but nevertheless he is counted among the unfaithful rulers. <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> allusion is made to his defence of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> against the incursions of the Syrians. On the occasion of Salmanasar's invasion in 842, Jehu sent a delegation to meet the Assyrian conqueror, with rich presents. This fact is recorded in one of the cuneiform inscriptions of Salmanasar, where Jehu is called the son of Amri (<em>Humrii</em>), doubtless through a mistake on the part of the Assyrian <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a>, who naturally considered Jehu as a lineal descendant of Amri, the founder of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, since he occupied the throne of that dynasty. The same event is pictorially set forth on the Nimrod obelisk.

<p>III. J<font size=-2>EHU</font> (<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>'Ieo&uacute;</em>), son of Obed, of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> (<a href="../bible/1ch002.htm#vrs38">1 Chronicles 2:38</a>).

<p>IV. J<font size=-2>EHU,</font> son of Josabia, of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/13794b.htm">Simeon</a> (<a href="../bible/1ch004.htm#vrs35">1 Chronicles 4:35</a>).

<p>V. J<font size=-2>EHU,</font> (<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>'Ieo&uacute;l</em>), one of David's heroes, of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/02480b.htm">Benjamin</a>, native of <a href="../cathen/01457a.htm">Anathoth</a> (<a href="../bible/1ch012.htm#vrs3">1 Chronicles 12:3</a>).
