<h1>Jeroboam</h1>  

<p>(Septuagint <em>'Ierobo&aacute;m</em>), name of two <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitish</a> kings.

<p>(1) J<font size=-2>EROBOAM</font> I was the first ruler of the Northern Kingdom after the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the Ten Tribes. He was a son of Nathan an Ephraimite, and his mother's name was Sarua. While still a young man he was placed by King Solomon over the tributes of Ephraim and Manasses (<a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#vrs28">1 Kings 11:28</a>). In that capacity he superintended the labours of his tribesmen in the building of the fortress Mello in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and of other public works, and he naturally became conversant with the widespread discontent caused by the extravagances which marked the reign of Solomon. Before the end of the latter's reign, Jeroboam received from the Prophet Abias an intimation that he was destined to be king over ten of the tribes which in punishment of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of Solomon were about to sever their allegiance to him and his house. At the same time it was promised that if Jeroboam were faithful to the Lord his house would be confirmed in authority over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#vrs38">1 Kings 11:38</a>). Not satisfied to await the death of the king, the time set by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> for the fulfillment of the promise, Jeroboam instigated a revolt which was unsuccessful, and he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee, taking refuge with King Sesac in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he remained until the death of Solomon in 975 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> (or 938 according to the Assyrian <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>). After this event he returned to Palestine, and he was made leader of the delegation sent by dissatisfied element of the population to ask the new king Roboam to lighten the burdens which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had placed upon them. No sooner had Roboam imprudently and harshly rejected their petition than ten of the tribes withdrew their allegiance to the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and proclaimed Jeroboam their king, only the tribes of Juda and Benjamin remaining faithful to Roboam. Jeroboam established his headquarters at Sichem, and soon added to the political also a religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Fearing lest the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the temple in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> prescribed by the Law might be an occasion for the people of the Northern Kingdom to go back to their old allegiance, he determined to provide for them places of worship within their own boundaries, and for this purpose he set up two golden calves to be worshipped, one in Bethel and the other in Dan. He also built <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> in the high places and had them served by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> drawn from the lowest of the people (<a href="../bible/1ki012.htm">1 Kings 12</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Abias announced the Divine vengeance that was to come upon the house of Jeroboam because of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds (<a href="../bible/1ki014.htm">1 Kings 14</a>), and in the sequel of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitish</a> history the worst doings of the kings are always referred to as like unto the wickedness of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who caused <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He died in 954 (or in 917) after a reign of twenty-two years.

<p>(2) J<font size=-2>EROBOAM</font> II was the twelfth successor of the preceeding and the fourth king of the dynasty of Jehu. He succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Joas in 824 (or 783) and reigned forty-one years. In 802 Rammanirar III, King of Assyria, undertook a campaign into the "West lands", and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Kingdom of Israel</a> (Land of Amri), together with <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, was placed under a heavy tribute. Jeroboam, however, taking advantage of the weakened condition of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, re-established toward the north and in other directions the ancient boundaries of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki014.htm#vrs25">2 Kings 14:25</a>). The military and patriotic successes of Jeroboam had been foretold by Jonas, son of Amathi (ibid.), and the Sacred Writer adds that the Lord saved the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> by the hand of Jeroboam, son of Joas. From the political standpoint, Jeroboam was an intelligent and energetic ruler, but with regard to his religious activities, his reign is resumed in these words: "He did that which was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> before the Lord. He departed not from all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of Jeroboam, son of Nabat who made <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../bible/2ki014.htm#vrs24">2 Kings 14:24</a>). Evidences of the religious decay during his otherwise prosperous reign are found in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Amos and Osee, his contemporaries, who frequently inveigh against <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and its many concomitant evils and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> degradation. Jeroboam II died in 783 (or 743).
