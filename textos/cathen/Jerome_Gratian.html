<h1>Jerome Gratian</h1>  

<p>Spiritual director of <a href="../cathen/14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a> and first Provincial of the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, 6 June, 1545; died at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 21 September, 1614. The son of Diego Gracian de Aldorete, secretary to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and Philip II, and of Jane de Antisco, daughter of the Polish ambassador at the Spanish Court, he received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native town and at the Jesuit College in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. He afterwards studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> where he took his degrees and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1569. The position of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his talents and virtues would have opened for him the door to the highest dignities, but, having become acquainted with some Teresian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, he took the habit of the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Pastrana, 25 March, 1572, under the name of Jerome of the Mother of God. Even during his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he was employed in the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and, almost immediately after his profession (28 March, 1573), was nominated pro-vicar apostolic of the Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of the Province of Andalusia. This province, which for many years had given trouble, resented the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of one who had only just entered the order, and offered a stubborn resistance to his regulations, even after his faculties had been confirmed and extended by the Nuncio Hormaneto. In virtue of these same faculties Gratian founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, of which he became prior, and approved of the establishment of several other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> as well as of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.

<p>The chapter of 1575, listening to the complaints of the Andalusians, decided to dissolve the reformed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> gave Gratian fresh powers, and for a while the reform continued to spread. Hormaneto was succeeded by Sega (June, 1577), who, prejudiced by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> rumours, turned against the followers of St. Teresa. Gratian was censured and relegated to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Alcal&aacute;, and the other leading members of the reform suffered similar punishments, until at length Philip II intervened. The next chapter general (1580) granted the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> canonical <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, and Gratian became their superior. Ever since he had first met St. Teresa (1575), he had remained her director, to whom, at the command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, she made a personal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience, while Gratian in all his works guided himself by the lights of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. In her books and in numerous letters she bears testimony to their agreement in spiritual as well as administrative matters; they were also at one in favouring the active life, the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and missionary work. After St. Teresa's death a party, calling themselves <em>zelanti</em>, came into prominence, with Nicholas Doria at their head, whose ideal of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> consisted in a rigid observance of the rule to the exclusion of exterior activity. Although <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a> and other prominent men were on Gratian's side, the opposite party came into office in 1585, and Gratian was charged with having introduced mitigations and novelties. In order to give effect to his views Doria introduced a new kind of government which concentrated all power, even in details, in the hands of a committee under his own presidency.

<p>Great was the consternation among the moderate party, greater still that of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, who resented any interference in their affairs. Through the instrumentality of <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a> and Father Gratian, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> approval of St. Teresa's constitutions, whereupon Doria resolved to exclude the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from the order. He also understood that so long as the opposition was being led by Gratian (<a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a> having meanwhile died) the new government could never come into force. On pretext, therefore, that his writings reflected unfavourably on the superiors, Gratian was summoned to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and, the informations taken against him having been materially altered by a personal enemy, he &#151; the director and right hand of St. Teresa, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of her reform, and for ten years its superior &#151; was expelled from the order on 17 February, 1592. This sentence, based on falsified evidence, was confirmed by the king, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, and even by the authorities at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who commanded Gratian to enter some other order.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> would not receive him, but the Augustinians consented to employ him in the foundation of some reformed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The ship, however, which was to carry him from <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was taken by pirates and he was made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Working among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves in the bagnio at <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, he strengthened those who were wavering, reconciled <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> at the risk of his life, and liberated many with the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> he succeeded in collecting. After eighteen months' captivity he obtained his freedom and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, to whom on a former occasion he had revealed secrets made known to him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, hearing of his works and sufferings, exclaimed: "This man is a saint", and caused the process of expulsion to be reexamined and the sentence to be rescinded (6 March 1596). But, as his return to the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> would have revived the former dissensions, Gratian was affiliated to the Calced Friars with all the honours and privileges, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to practise the Rule of the Reform. He was sent to Ceuta and Tetuan to preach the Jubilee (1600-1605), proceeded afterwards to Valladolid to assist his dying mother, and was finally called to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by his friend and protector, Archduke Albers (1606). There he continued a life of self-abnegation and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>. Buried in the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a> of the Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, his remains were repeatedly transferred, but finally lost during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The list of Gratian's writing in Latin, Spanish, and Italian fills eighteen columns in ANTONIO, Bibliotheca Hispana nova (Madrid, 1783), 576 sqq.; the works printed during his lifetime and immediately after his death have become exceedingly rare. Within the last years there appeared for the first time his autobiography (Peregrinaciones de Anastasio, Burgos, 1905), and his Memoirs of St. Teresa (Dialogos de Santa Teresa, Burgos, 1909), while some other important manuscripts are ready for publication. Besides these sources see ST. TERESA, Book of Foundations (chapter xxiii), which should be compared with other portions of her writings and the annotations by various editors; Biblioth. Carmelit., I, 645; GREGOIRE DE ST. JOSEPH, Le P. Gratien et ses Juges (Rome, 1904; also in Italian and Spanish).</p></div>
