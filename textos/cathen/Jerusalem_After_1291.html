<h2 id="section1">Political history</h2>

<p><a href="../images/08344acx.gif"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/08344act.gif"></a> The Latin dominion over <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> really came to an end on 2 October, 1187, when the city opened its gates to Saladin (Yusuf ibn Ayyub, Salah-ed-din, Emir of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, 1169-93); although fragments of the Latin kingdom in Palestine lasted into another century. <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> acquired a short possession of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> itself by treaty later, and the title "King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" added an empty splendour to the styles of various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> sovereigns almost to our own time. Nevertheless after 1187 the episode of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> rule over the Holy City is closed. From that time it falls back again into its former state of a city under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> government, in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> are at best only tolerated.

<p>As soon as Saladin's army entered the city they set and to destroy all traces of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rule. They tore the great gilt cross from the Dome of the Rock, broke up the bells, plundered churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, restored all the buildings that had been mosques (notably the Dome of the Rock and the El-Aqsa mosque), turned other churches into stables or granaries, founded <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> institutions that go by the general name of <em>waqf</em>. While <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was thunderstruck at the loss of the Holy City, and was preparing a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to recapture it, letters were sent to all parts of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> world announcing the glad tidings that <em>El-Quds</em> was now purified and restored to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believers. But &#151; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to the promise made by Omar (see above) &#151; Saladin left the Holy Sepulchre, as well as a few other churches, to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (the Orthodox). For the use of these they had to pay a heavy tribute. The church of the Knights of St. John was turned into a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> (at the place still called <em>Muristan</em>, where the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church now stands). Saladin further strengthened the walls of the city when the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a> (with <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">King Richard of England</a>) approached and threatened it (1191). In 1219 the Sultan Malik-el-Mu'azzam (d. 1227, viceroy at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> for El-Mansur) ordered these walls to be destroyed, lest they should become a protection for the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. In 1229 another short interlude began. <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> (1212-50) came on his (the Fifth) <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. He obtained by treaty with the Sultan of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, El-Kamil (1219-38), possession of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and the pilgrim roads from <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Jaffa</a> and 'Akka for ten years and a half. The city was not to be fortified, and the <em>Haram esh-sherif</em> (the Temple area) was to remain in exclusive possession of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. In 1239 the Emir of Kerak, En-nasir Daud, conquered <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> again and destroyed the Tower of David. But in 1243 he made over the city to the Latins without any stipulations. This led to the final loss of the city. For Essalih Ayyub, Caliph of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (1238-49), then called on the savage Khwarizmian tribes from Mesopotamia to recapture it. They poured over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> plundering and murdering, and in September, 1244, stormed <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In the massacre that followed 7000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> perished; <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was restored once more, and finally, to the Empire of the Caliph. From this time the remaining Latin possessions in Palestine were lost one by one in quick succession. The last town, 'Akka (Saint-Jean d'Acre), fell in 1291.

<p>The title "King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" went from Guy of Lusignan (King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, 1186-92) to Henry of Champagne (1192-7), to whom it was already only a title of pretence since the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> ruled in the city. Amaury (Amalric) of Lusignan (brother of Guy), King of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (1194-1205), was elected king by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> army at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and married Isabel, daughter of Amaury I of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1162-73). He then added the title of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (Amaury II). From his time the Lusignan kings of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> used the title of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and quartered its arms (argent, a cross potent between four crosslets or) with their paternal coat (barry of ten azure and argent, a lion rampant or, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> gules. See the arms of "die conine von cipers" in Gelre's Wapenboeck, 1334-72). The Lusignan "Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>" came to an end in 1474, when Catherine Cornaro, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the last king (James III) abdicated in favour of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>. Whatever <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> they may be supposed to have had to the title of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> passed to the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Meanwhile, at the death of Amaury II (1205), John of Brienne who married Mary, daughter of the same Isabel and Conrad of Montferrat, began a rival line of titular Kings of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. His daughter Isabel (Iolanthe), married <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, who then assumed the title, and (as we have seen) for a short time actually reigned in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> himself in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Sepulchre on 17 March, 1229. After him the title was borne by his descendants to Conradin (d. 1268). Then Hugh III, prince of Antioch (1267-80) and regent of the scattered Latin possessions in Palestine for the absent kings of this line, began another series of titular Kings of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> in 1269. His claim was maintained by his son Henry at 'Akka. But Mary of Antioch, also descended from Isabel, set up a claim to this visionary crown, and then sold it to her grand-nephew, Charles of Anjou, King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1285-1309), who had already obtained another claim by marrying Margaret, grand-daughter of John of Brienne. While the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> were gaining ground and driving back the thin remnant of the Latin kingdom every year, the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> and the party of Hugh of Antioch were fighting for the empty title. Eventually the kings of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> added it to their style, and "Jerusalem and the two Sicilies" existed as a "royal title down to the Italian revolution (1860). Lastly, the House of Habsburg also added this shadowy royalty to its long list of titles. Iolanthe-daughter of Rene the Good (d. 1480), titular King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Naples-married Duke Frederick of Lorraine; from her the title came to the Dukes of Lorraine, and so, through <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa's</a> marriage with Francis of Lorraine (1736), to the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The arms of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> formed one of the fifty-eight quarterings of the Imperial Arms of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; and "Koenig von Jerusalem" was one of the emperor's long string of titles, till Ferdinand I (1835-48) had the good sense to reduce both quarterings and titles to those that had a real meaning. The story of this title of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> forms a curious bypath in history, and is a typical example of the pretence that <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">medieval heralds</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> ruled again over the Holy City. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> lingered on in the West for centuries. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> (1458-64) still hoped to renew the work of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>; but nothing ever came of these attempts. <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was lost to <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> in 1187; it is lost still.



<p>Till the sixteenth century <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> belonged to the caliphs in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but it was constantly overrun for short periods by their various enemies. In the thirteenth century the Mongols, who had destroyed the line of caliphs at Baghdad, poured over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> plundering and destroying under their chief Hulagu (capture of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, 1260). Kutuz (1259-60) sent his famous general, Beibars el-bundukdari, by whom the Mongols were driven out. Beibars then had Kutuz <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> and reigned as caliph in his stead (1260-77). He succeeded in driving the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> nearly back to their last stronghold, 'Akka, crushed the "Assassins" (<em>Hashishiye</em>)-fanatical Isma'ilis who had been the terror of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> for nearly two centuries-and conquered a great part of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The name of Beibars (Es sultan el-malik ez-zahir, rukn-ed-dunga wa-din, "The sultan, the manifest king, prop of the world and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>") may be seen on many monuments in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Kala'un (1279-90) deposed Beibars' son, made himself caliph, further harassed the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, and built splendid monuments all over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. In 1400 the Mongols under Timur again devastated the land.

<p>Meanwhile the Osmanli <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were becoming the dominant race in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. In 1516 under Sultan Selim I (1512-20), after they had crushed the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> (1514), they turned southward towards <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. On 14 August, 1516, Selim routed the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> army and killed the Caliph Kansuh el-Ghuri. On 22 January, 1517, Selim entered Cairo in triumph. Mutawekkil, the last <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> caliph, died a captive of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1538, bequeathing his title to the conquering House of Osman. It is on the strength of this (quite illegal) legacy that the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> sultan still calls himself Caliph of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. From this time the Turk has been master of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In 1799 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> invaded <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and reached <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. In 1831 the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> army under Ibrahim Pasha defeated the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> near Homs (Emessa), and kept possession of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> till <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> conquered them back for the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1840. During the nineteenth century <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> has had her share of various <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> reforms. <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the holy places especially, as being the most interesting parts of the empire to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and the scene of continual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, were the places where the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government was most anxious to show that its reforms were really meant. The great number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> institutions of various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and the large <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> have almost taken from it the appearance of an Eastern town. The latest development is the enormous increase of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who, in spite of repeated attempts on the part of the government to keep them out, form large colonies in and around the city. They and the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are now the predominant element. There are no cities of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire where (in 1913) <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> were so little in evidence as in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a> and <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The Holy Sepulchre</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> found the group of buildings as they had been left by Constantine IX's restoration (1048; see above). From 1140 to 1149 they made a complete restoration of the whole under their architect Master Jordan. The effect of this was a great French-Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. At the east of the round building over the Anastasis a <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, and beyond it a choir and an <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> were built; an aisle surrounded the choir and <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>. At the junction with the round building they put a triumphal arch. All the various <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> opened into the central church. From the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> steps led down to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Helena. The entrance was at the south. In this way the Holy Sepulchre became one great building. From the choir one could see into the Anastasis and into all the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders'</a> Church is the one that still stands: the beautiful Romanesque doors, at the south especially, still give it a Western appearance. Slight restorations were made in 1244, 1310, 1400 and 1719. In 1808 the round building was burnt down. The Orthodox persuaded the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government to allow them alone to restore it. Their architect closed up the triumphal arch, thus again destroying the unity of the whole, and replaced the old columns of the rotunda by clumsy pillars. He also enclosed the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the present marble covering. The choir of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders'</a> Church became the present Orthodox <em>Katholikon</em>. The arches between it and its <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> were walled up; the <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> became dark passages. The <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> they built over the rotunda threatened to fall in 1869. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> together had it restored by the iron <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> that still exists. It was the dispute between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and Orthodox as to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre that immediately caused the Crimean War (1853). All the parts of the church now needed repairs which were not executed, because no religion would allow the other to undertake them for fear of disturbing their various <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The inside of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> over the Anastasis especially was rotting daily. But the reparation of the roof was the most dangerous of all, since by <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> law the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to repair implied possession and the possession of a roof meant possession of all it covers. In the present building, walled up and divided into a complex mass of dark passages and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> laden with tawdry ornament, it is still possible to trace the plan of the great <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders'</a> Church. For the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> see below.
<h2 id="section3">The Orthodox patriarchate</h2>

<p>Through all the political changes, under <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Saracens</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the old line of the Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (who followed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the eleventh century) goes on. But there is little to tell of their history. The line was often broken, and there have been many disputed successions. For the list of these <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> since Sophronius see <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens Christianus", III, 498-516. When the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> took <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1099), the Orthodox patriarch (Simon II) fled to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. As long as the former held the city, it was impossible for the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> rival of their Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> to live in it. In 1142 the Orthodox continued their line by electing Arsenius II: he resided at Constantinople. After the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> had recaptured the city, the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> came back and lived in or near it. The only event of any importance in the later history of the Orthodox Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (often wrongly called the Synod of Bethlehem) in 1672. This synod represents the climax of the Orthodox reaction against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of Cyril Lucaris (d. 1638). Cyril was <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (Cyril I) at five separate intervals (1620-3, 1623-30, 1630-4, 1634-5, 1637-8); he had imbibed <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> from his friends in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. As patriarch he organized &#151; or tried to organize &#151; a reforming party, and he wrote in 1629 a famous "Confession" (Eastern Confession of the Christian Faith), which was full of pure <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. Eventually Lucaris was accused of treason against the sultan, and strangled by the janizaries in 1638. He left a certain number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantizing</a> disciples, but the enormous majority of the Orthodox abhorred his new doctrines. In the years following his death four <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held &#151; at Constantinople (1639), Yassy in Moldavia (1643), <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1672), and Constantinople again (1672) in which the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was asserted against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the most uncompromising terms. Of these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> that of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was by far the most important. It is indeed one of the most important, as it is the last, of the official pronouncements of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and may be compared to our <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Dositheus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1669-1707), who summoned the synod, was certainly the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that line during this Iater period. He was one of the most important and learned of all modern Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. As patriarch he defended the claims of his see, did all he could to persuade the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government to expel Latins and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> from the holy places, and reorganized the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> on a stricter basis. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> he wrote works against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and collected evidences from former writers about the various questions that were being discussed in his time &#151; the eternal questions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the procession of the Holy Ghost, the <a href="../cathen/07301a.htm">Hesychast</a> controversy, etc., and then, most of all, the new questions raised by Lucaris and his friends. His chief works are <em>Tomos katallages</em> (1692), <em>Tomos agapes</em> (1699), <em>Tomos charas</em> (1705). In the first of these he publishes the acts of a pretended Synod of Constantinople against the Latins in 1540. No such synod was held; the acts are a palpable <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Dositheus also wrote a "History of the Patriarchs of Jerusalem", published after his death (Bukarest, 1715). This work contains more than is promised by its title. It almost amounts to a general <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> from the Orthodox side with vehement polemics against other Churches.

<p>But Dositheus's chief work was the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He summoned it on the occasion of consecrating a church at Bethlehem in 1672 (hence the common name "Synod of Bethlehem"). It met in the same year at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The acts are signed by Dositheus, his predecessor the ex-patriarch Nectarius, six <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the Archimandrite of the Holy Sepulchre, Josaphat, and a great number of other <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. There are sixty-eight signatures in all. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> was represented by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Timothy. The acts are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 March, 1672; they bear the title: "Christ guides. A shield of the Orthodox Faith, or the Apology composed by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> Dositheus against the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who falsely say that the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> thinks heretically about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things as they do." The first part begins by quoting the text: "There is a time to speak and a time to be silent," which text is explained and enlarged upon at length. It tells the story of the summoning of the synod, and vehemently denies that the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> ever held the opinions attributed to Lucaris. To show this the relations between the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and Jeremias II of Constantinople are quoted as well as the acts of former <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (Constantinople and Yassy). An elaborate attempt is then made to prove that Lucaris did not really write the famous "Confession". To do this the "Confession" is compared clause by clause with other statements made by him in sermons and in other works. This denial, it should be noted, is a palpable piece of bad <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the part of the synod. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> at all as to the authenticity of Lucaris's "Confession". That he used other language on other occasions, especially in preaching, is well-known and very natural. In chapter ii the synod declares that in any case Lucaris showed the "Confession" to no one (this is also quite <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>), and tries to find further reasons for doubting his authorship. Chapter iii maintains that, even if he had written it, it would not thereby become a confession of the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, but would remain merely the private opinion of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>: here the Fathers are on safe ground. Chapter iv defends &#151; no longer Cyril but &#151; the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> by quoting her formularies, and contains a list of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the "Confessions". Chapter v again tries to defend Cyril by quoting various deeds and sayings of his and transcribes the whole <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the synod of Constantinople in 1639, and then that of Yassy (<em>Giasion</em>) in 1641. Chapter vi gives the decrees of this synod in the form of a "Confession of Dositheus". It has eighteen decrees (<em>horoi</em>), then four "questions" (<em>eroteseis</em>) with long answers. In these all the points denied by Lucaris's "Confession" (Church and Bible, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, cult. of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, the liturgy, a real sacrifice, etc.) are maintained at great length and in the most uncompromising way. A short epilogue closes the acts. Then follow the date, signatures, and seals.

<p>Because of its determined anti-Protestantism (<a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are described as being patently <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <em>airetikon koryphaiotatoi</em>), <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers have described this synod as a work of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, of the French ambassador at that time, Olivier de Nointel, and of other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who were undermining the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> represents a strongly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reaction after Lucaris's troubles (it accepts and defends the word <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> &#151; <em>metousiosis</em> &#151; for instance). It is all the more remarkable that its decrees have been accepted unreservedly by the whole <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. They were at once approved by the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, etc.; they are always printed in full among the symbolic books of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, and form an official creed or declaration in the strictest sense, which every <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Christian</a> is bound to accept.

<p>An affair that concerned the Orthodox Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was that of the independence of the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, one of the richest and most famous of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christendom</a>, was undoubtedly at one time subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In 1782, after a great struggle, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> succeeded in asserting his independence of any patriarch. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sinai the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> now reigns over the smallest autocephalous Church of their communion. But he is still <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> have constantly tried to assert some kind of authority over their independent daughter-church. The last great quarrel was in 1866, when the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (Cyril Byzantius) had a dispute with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Instead of applying to Jerusalem he wrote to Constantinople for help. Sophronius III of Constantinople (1863-67) at once took up his cause against the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> then summoned a synod (1867), in which he protested hotly against the interference of Constantinople. Less for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem's</a> shadowy <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over Sinai than because of the ever-welcome chance of opposing the arrogant interference of Constantinople, the other Orthodox Churches all supported <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, so that Byzantius was deposed and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople had to resign. But that is the last attempt made by <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to interfere in the affairs of what is now universally recognized as the autocephalous Church of Sinai.

<p>During these centuries the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, never very rich, suffered from steadily increasing poverty. Dositheus complained bitterly of this. He says that <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are rarer, and that the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who do come bring little money; he himself is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to travel constantly for the sake of collecting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Moldavia, etc. A result of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest was that since 1517 the Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> have been subject to their brothers of Constantinople in civil matters, as far as the government is concerned. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> made the ecumenical Patriarch civil head of all the "Roman nation" (<em>rum millet</em>), that is the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> can approach the <em>Porte</em> only through him. This <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> must not be confused with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. In Orthodox canon law the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is autocephalous, having no superior authority but that of Christ and the Seven Councils. <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, like the other free branches of their communion, has always indignantly withstood the many attempts of Constantinople to assert a kind of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, and has always upheld the axiom that that ecumenical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> outside his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Nevertheless, during these centuries till quite modern times, the independence of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was only theoretical. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were all Greeks. Originally, under the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> rule, they had been <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, taken naturally from the native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Palestine. But in 1534 Germanus, a Greek of the Peloponnesus, succeeded in being elected and from that time to this his successors have all been Greeks. Germanus further succeeded in hellenizing all the administration of his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>: the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Holy Sepulchre, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, and officials of the patriarchal court are all Greeks. It became a recognized principle that no native <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> should ever be appointed to any office in the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The result of this is that for over three centuries the patriarchal curia of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> has been and remains a foreign colony in the land, utterly separate from the native <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people. But this state of things will soon come to an end. Following the triumphant example of Antioch there is at this moment a great agitation among the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> to assert their place in their own <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. And as they are supported by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> they will succeed. The reigning patriarch, Damianus, though of course a Greek, is not unfriendly to the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> agitators. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the "Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre", stand out as a bulwark of Orthodoxy for the present state of things, and treat the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> as <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> revolutionaries. Everyone has heard of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> riots that took place in 1908, and culminated in the pretended deposition of the patriarch. Till quite lately, moreover, most of these Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> did not even take the trouble to reside in their titular city. Mere servants of the oecumenical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having no interest in their <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> flock, they were content to fritter away their lives in Constantinople, useless ornaments of the Phanar. Since the accession of Cyril II (1845-72), this abuse has been removed and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> live near the Monastery of the Holy Sepulchre.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> have almost entirely disappeared. In Juvenal's time (420-58) fifty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the three Palestines obeyed the new patriarch. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> conquest, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, and the other troubles of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> gradually reduced this number, till there are now only a handful of <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who reside at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> instead of in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and a few sees whose titles are registered but are always vacant. In 1913 only one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of 'Akka) lived in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (see the list below). The full list of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> during this period will be found in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens Christianus", III; for the later ones see Williams, "Holy City", I, pp. 487-8. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> in the nineteenth century are: Anthimus, 1787-1808; Polycarp, 1808-27; Athanasius V, 1827-45; Cyril II, 1845-72. The last-mentioned refused to sign the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the Bulgars in 1872, and was deposed the same year. Procopius was intruded while Cyril still claimed to be patriarch. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the native <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> acknowledged Cyril, the Phanar and nearly all the rest of the Orthodox world Procopius. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> deposed Procopius in 1875, and Cyril died. <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> then appointed Hierotheus, who, however, to everyone's surprise took the side of the Phanar in the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> quarrel. So <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> fell foul of him, and took the opportunity of confiscating the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Holy Sepulchre in Bessarabia. Hierotheus died in 1882. There were then three candidates for the vacant see, Nicodemus, Gerasimus and Photius. Photius (always a determined enemy of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>) was elected canonically. But the Russians made the sultan refuse him the <em>berat</em>, and give it to Nicodemus instead. Gerasimus became <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in 1885. Photius went back to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Sinai. Nicodemus reigned from 1883 to 1890. In 1890 the Phanar persuaded the sultan to depose Nicodemus, and give the <em>berat</em> to Photius. Nicodemus retired to Halki. But the Russians absolutely refused to allow Photius to become patriarch. So the third original candidate, Gerasimus, was persuaded to leave Antioch and come to Jerusalem. He reigned from 1891 to 1897. Photius became <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and in 1899 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. Gerasimus died in 1897 and the Russians tried to have their candidate Euthymius, Archimandrite of the Holy Sepulehre, appointed. But the candidate of the Phanar, Damianus, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Philadelphia, was appointed in 1897. For further information about the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> see below.
<h2 id="section4">The Catholic Church in Jerusalem</h2>

<p>The organization of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Palestine dates from the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. As soon as <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a> became King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1099, a Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was set up. Arnulf, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the Normans, was made administrator of this <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1099. But he was soon set aside because of his immoral life, and Dagobert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, elected patriarch. The line of Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> is: Dagobert of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, 1099-1107 (Ehremar, anti-patriarch set up by Baldwin I while Dagobert was travelling to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to answer the king's complaints); Ghibellin of Arles, 1107-11; Arnulf (the original administrator), 1111-8; Guarimund, 1118-28; Stephen, 1128-30; William, 1130-45; Fulcher, 1146-57; Amalric, 1157-80; Heraclius, 1180-91. &#151; During the episcopate of Heraclius the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Saracens</a> took <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (1187), and the Orthodox patriarch returned. From this time the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> resided at the court of the Latin kings; when that court was at 'Akka (during the last period of the kingdom) the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was united to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of that town (Ptolemais in Latin). &#151; Michael; Bl. Albert of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> (d. 1214); Gerald or Girold, 1214-27; Robert, 1227-54; James Pantaleon (afterwards <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Pope Urban IV</a>), 1254-61; William, 1261-; Thomas; John, 1270-8; Nicholas, 1278-94.

<p>Since 'Akka fell in 1291, the Latin line was continued by merely titular <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, living at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and using the basilica of St. Laurence without the Walls as their patriarchal church, till <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a> restored the real <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1847. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> time were in most cases not very edifying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Much of the history of the Latin Kingdom is taken up with their quarrels with the kings, intrigues, and generally <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> adventures. An amusing, if hostile account of these intrigues will be found in Besant and Palmer's "Jerusalem" (throughout the book). The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> extended to the limits of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders'</a> territory; as they conquered new cities, so were new Latin sees established. There were four provinces: <em>Palaestina I</em> (metropolis, Caesarea; two suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> and Saba), <em>Palaestina II</em> (<a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> with one suffragan, <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>), <em>Palaestina III</em> (metropolis Petra, suffragan Sinai), <em>Phoenicia</em> (metropolis <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>; suffragans, St. Jean d'Acre, <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, Paneas). Bethlehem and Ascalon (joined), <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a> and Lydda (Diospolis) were <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the patriarch. But the number of sees fluctuated with the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>; there are various lists given by contemporary authors representing different circumstances. There were many <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> besides the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of the Holy Sepulchre (following the Augustinian rule); for these see <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, III, 1279 sqq., and the "Gesta Dei per Francos" (Hanover, 1611), 1077.

<p>From the thirteenth century, when this <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> disappeared, down to our own time, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause was upheld almost solely by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were first sent to Palestine by St. Francis himself in 1219. The order has a special province, the "Custodia Terr&aelig; Sanct&aelig;", which includes Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. The head of this province, and till 1847 the supreme authority for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Palestine, is the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> provincial who bears the title "Custos Terrae Sanctae". He had episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (but not orders), and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government granted him many privileges as civil head of the "Latin nation" in Palestine. This province (commonly called by the Italian form "Terra Santa", which has passed into Arabic and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>) is recruited from all the other <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> provinces. Its official language is Italian. During the long centuries since the fall of the Latin kingdom the heroic <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> have guarded the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> around the Holy Places. Always exposed to the jealousy of the Orthodox and other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, continually <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, they have kept their place till today, and with it our <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the Holy Land, constantly at the price of their blood. It was in their hospices (the <em>case nuove</em>, which they have built all over Palestine) that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pilgrim found shelter. They have kept the Latin altars in repair, and have never ceased offering the Latin Mass on them for six centuries when no one else cared for them. The "Reverendissimus Custos Terrae Sanctae" now fills a much less important place in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Palestine; but no changes can ever make one forget what we owe to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> for defending our cause during those dark years.

<p>In the nineteenth century it was felt that a state of things of which the result was practically <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> monopoly in Palestine had become an anomaly. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government had become tolerant, the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> increased enormously, many other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders had built houses at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and other cities, there were <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who wished to become <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to serve their own people, but who had not necessarily a vocation for the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. So the old conditions that reserved practically all <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> to <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and submitted every one to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <em>custos</em> &#151; natural enough when there had been no one else to undertake the work &#151; were no longer reasonable now. There was no reason why the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Palestine should not be governed by an episcopal <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the normal way. Moved by these considerations <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> decided to change the titular Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> into a real see again at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The titular patriarch, Augustus Foscolo (1830-47), was requested to resign. In his place Joseph Valerga was made patriarch in 1847, and ordered to take up his residence in the Holy City (Brief of 23 July 1847). He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself on 10 October, 1847, and arrived in his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> in January, 1848. He found 4200 Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there; at his death in 1872 he had doubled the number. The succession of these restored Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> is: Joseph Valerga, 1847-72; Vincent Bracco, 1873-89; Louis Piavi, 1889-1905. Mgr. Piavi died on 24 January, 1905. After some delay, the present patriarch, Mgr. Philip Camassei, formerly <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14395a.htm">Syra</a>, was promoted in November, 1906, and entered <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> just before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1907.
<h2 id="section5">Present condition of the city</h2>

<p>Jerusalem (<em>El Quds</em>) is the capital of a sanjak and the seat of a mutasarrif directly dependent on the <em>Sublime Porte</em>. In the administration of the sanjak the mutasarrif is assisted by a council called <em>majlis ida ra</em>; the city has a municipal government (<em>majlis baladiye</em>) presided over by a mayor. The total population is estimated at 66,000. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> census of 1905, which counts only Ottoman subjects, gives these figures: <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 45,000; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, 8,000; Orthodox Christians, 6000; Latins, 2500; <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 950; <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 800; Melkites,&uacute; <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, 150; <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>, 100; <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, 100; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians, 50. During the nineteenth century large suburbs to the north and east have grown up, chiefly for the use of the Jewish colony. These suburbs contain nearly half the present population.

<p>The Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all Latins of Palestine, extending to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> on the south, the Latin Delegacy of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (seat at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>) on the north, and including <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. He is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> (<em>libera collatio S. Pont.</em>), and is personally exempt from <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authority (still nominally under the protectorate of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). He is represented in the <em>majlis</em>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> has no suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The <em>Custos Terr&aelig; Sanct&aelig;</em> retains the use of episcopal insignia and certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of admission to the holy places; otherwise, he must now be counted only as the Provincial of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Appointments to the "Order of the Holy Sepulchre" (a military <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">order of knighthood</a> which began with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> and continues as a small dignity given to deserving <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), formerly made by the <em>custos</em>, are now in the hands of the patriarch. The patriarchal church in theory is the Holy Sepulchre. But since <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have only alternative <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> there with the Orthodox and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, Foscolo built a pro-cathedral near the Jaffa Gate (to the north): the patriarch's house and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> adjoin this church. But the patriarch celebrates the functions of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> and others at the Holy Sepulchre according to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> conceded to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which are carefully drawn up and enforced by the Government. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <em>custos</em> lives at the Convent of St. Saviour to the north of the Muristan. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> head-quarters at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It was originally a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Georgian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and was acquired by the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in 1551. Next to it is the large <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Saviour, finished in 1885 at the expense of the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I; the <em>Casa Nuova</em> (hospice for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>) is close at hand. Then there are an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, printing press, etc., all in charge of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, clustered around the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have also the little <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Holy Sepulchre with the "Chapel of the Apparition," that forms the northern part of the group of buildings at the Anastasis. This has been <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> since the thirteenth century (P. Barnabe Meistermann's "Nouveau Guide" contains an excellent plan of the Anastasis, coloured according to the possessions of the various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>). Six or seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and as many lay-brothers are sent from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Saviour to reside here for periods of three months in turn. These are the "Fathers of the Holy Sepulchre" who are always on guard to celebrate the Latin Offices, receive <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and maintain our traditional <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. They have a hard time while they are on <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. There is no way out of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> except by the door to the whole complex on the south. This door is locked by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> guardians at night, so the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> are locked in. Their food is brought to them from St. Saviour, and passed through a wicket in the great door every day. Formerly the residence in the narrow damp <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> shut in among the other buildings, which they do not leave during their time of office, was very injurious to their health. But in 1869 Emperor Francis Joseph of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, when he made his <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem, obtained from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government some improvement in the ventilation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and leave to build a terrace and a <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a> behind it. In 1875 the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> rang their bells to summon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to their services for the first time at this place since centuries (the Orthodox do not use bells but clappers &#151; <em>symantra</em>; bells are an abomination to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>). The third <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is by the Chapel of the Scourging in the <em>Tariq Bab Sitti Miriam</em>, opposite the Antonia castle. This <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonged to them from the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> till 1618. It was then taken away by the Pasha and turned into a stable. It was given back in 1838, and restored at the expense of King Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

<p>Other Latin properties in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> are the College of St. Ann for Melkite <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> governed (since 1878) by <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie's</a> <em><a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">Pres blancs</a></em> near the <em>Bab Sitti Miriam</em> (Gate of the Lady Mary), the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and <em>Ecole biblique</em> at St. Stephen outside the Damascus Gate (1884), the great French Hospice "Notre Dame de France", directed by the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Augustinians of the Assumption</a> outside the walls to the northwest near the Bab 'Abdu-I'hamid (1887), the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the Mount of Olives (1899), the new German <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at the "Dormitio B.M.V." on Mount Sion, given by the German Emperor in 1906, the German and Austrian hospices, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, the Italian <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, and French Peres de Sion and <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>. There are <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the French <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (on the Mount of Olives, since 1873), <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, "Damesde Sion", Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, Sisters of the Rosary of St. Joseph and of Marie-Reparatrice". Of all these Latin institutions the older colonies (e.g. the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>) have on the whole an Italian character, by far the greatest number are French, but the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> (especially since the troubles about the protectorate) are now getting considerable influence. As throughout the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire early in the twentieth century, French was the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> language most spoken at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>Most of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches have establishments in the Holy City. The Melkite <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> also bears the titles of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He has a church (St. Veronica) in the Khan-ez-zeit just behind St. Saviour where the Melkite patriarchal vicar (who generally resides at <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Jaffa</a>) and the patriarch himself (when present) officiate; near it is a hospice for Melkites. There is also a Melkite <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near the New Bazaar (Es-suk el-jedid). The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> have a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church served by their patriarchal vicar; that of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (Notre Dame du Spasme) is in the Via Dolorosa opposite the Austrian hospice. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> had an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Michael Alessandrius) from 1855 to 1867. No successor has been appointed to him. The Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have also a small church where their patriarchal vicar officiates. The Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> is considered as administrator of an Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; but he does not use the title. A hardship felt by all these Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is that they cannot celebrate their Offices at the Holy Sepulchre. Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the Turk recognizes only the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Latins there.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> naturally also fills a large place among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The patriarch bears the title "the most blessed and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the holy city <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and all Palestine, of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Arabia beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, Cana of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and Holy Sion". It should be noticed that of all the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who bear the title "<a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>", this one alone represents historic continuity from the original line. His <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> extends to the Lebanon on the north and the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> on the south (except the autocephalous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> on Sinai). East and west it is bounded by the Syrian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and the sea. The patriarch resides by the "Great Laura" in the Haret deir-er-rum not far from the Anastasis; he has also properties in the country at Katamon near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (where they say St. Simeon lived) and near Deir Aban (between <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Jaffa). The sees of the Patriarchate are C&aelig;sarea, <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis (Beisan)</a>, <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, Ptolemais ('Akka), <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a>, <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, Nablus, <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, Tabor, the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/11608c.htm">Pella</a>, Kerak, Diocaesarea (Sepphoris), Madaba. The only resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of 'Akka; those of <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a>, <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, Nablus, <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, Philadelphia, Kerak and Madaba live at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and form the Patriarch's Court. The other sees are left vacant. In the administration of his Church the patriarch is assisted by a synod consisting of ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and ten <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>. Near the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is the large Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (St. Constantine) with a printing press and hospice for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. In the Holy Sepulchre the Orthodox possess the central part (the "Katholikon") and various <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. They have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built against it (to the west). The actual Anastasis under its <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> is too precious to be given to any one religion; so it is common <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, used in turn by all. There are sixteen other Orthodox <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in and around the city and various hospices, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> they have the "Monastery of the Holy Cross" (<em>Deir el-musallebe</em>) about one and a half miles west of the city. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (said to be at the place where the tree grew from which the cross was made) was originally Georgian. Inscriptions in that language may be seen in the church. It was sold to the Greeks, opened as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> college in 1855, since then several times closed and re-opened. Many students do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, but come from <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, etc., to study here. There are hardly any <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. The only language used in the college is Greek. The Greek element has hitherto had exclusive possession of the older Orthodox establishments in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>We have alluded to the troubles now raging through the attempt of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> to break this monopoly. It is considerably broken, though not in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, by the Russian establishments. The autocephalous Russian Church is represented in Palestine by a great number of large colonies and institutions altogether separate from those of the Patriarchate. The first Russian <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> arrived in 1844; the consulate dates from 1858. The Russian Palestine Society builds churches, in which the liturgy is celebrated in Slavonic, and hospices for Russian <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> all over the country to the great annoyance of the Greek patriarchal element. It is because <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> has taken up the cause of the native <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> that they can no longer be ignored as obscure revolutionaries of the lower classes. On the contrary, the Greek influence is already doomed; when Lord Damianus dies or is successfully deposed, we may expect to hear of an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> patriarch as his successor. It remains to be it made at Antioch by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> him. The chief Russian establishments at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> are the enormous group of buildings outside the city on the Jaffa road. These contain a large and very handsome church where the Russian <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> officiates, huge hospices for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and other buildings, all close to the Russian consulate. Then they have a gorgeous church in Gethsemane, and another one with a high tower, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and other buildings on the top of the Mount of Olives (the place of the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> in their tradition). There are also another Russian hospice in the Muristan, a <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. But the Russians have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> at the Holy Sepulchre. Each time they want to have a service there they must ask leave of the patriarch. About 8000 Russian <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visit the Holy Places every year.

<p>The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have a Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as one of their two minor <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>. In the seventeenth century the Katholikos of Echmiadzin gave the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>; thereupon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> assumed the title patriarch and began ordaining <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The title is now acknowledged by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> extends throughout the Pashaliks of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, 'Akka, Tarabulus (Tripoli), and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. Under him are seven <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who live with him and form his synod, and fourteen suffragans. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is at the great <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. James to the southwest of the city, near the Bab Nebi Daud. This was formerly a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Georgian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> possess it since the thirteenth century. Besides the patriarch and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> about a hundred vartabeds live here. There are also a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a hospice for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> adjoining the great church. They also have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> just outside the same gate (the reputed house of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>), a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (Deir-ez-zeituni) near the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, and land outside the city opposite the great Russian colony. The whole southwest of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> around their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is the "Armenian quarter". At the Holy Sepulchre they possess the Chapels of St. Helena, of St. John, of the "Division of Garments", of St. James (behind the Anastasis), and the "Stone of the Holy Women" (cf. Meistermann's plan). The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have further <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of walking in procession about the Anastasis, and take their turn to celebrate their offices at it.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobite Syrians</a> have a little church (claimed as the house of John Mark) in the <em>Haret-en-nebi Daud</em>, with a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> where the vicar of their maphrian (who now unites with this dignity that of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) resides, and the central <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> behind the Anastasis. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> have a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (<em>Deir-es-sultan</em>) close to the Holy Sepulchre to the north, at the ninth Station of the Cross, with a hospice. Another Coptic church is at their Khan north of the <em>Birket Hammam-el-batrak</em> (Pool of Hezekiah), and they have several <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the Holy Sepulchre itself. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> have had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> since the eleventh century. He now resides at Cairo with the title <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the East (<em>Sharkiye</em>), or of the Anastasis (<em>Kayame</em>), or <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<em>El Quds</em>), and ranks immediately after the Abuna of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> possess a large round church outside the city to the northwest (beyond the Russian buildings) and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> touching the Holy Sepulchre and the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. They have no special place in the great church itself; but share with the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> (with whom, of course, they are in communion). The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> had a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from the ninth to the thirteenth century. Since 1282 the title seems to have disappeared (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, II, 1299).

<p>Lastly, English, German and American <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have a great number of establishments, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and hospices in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The most important of these are the German Evangelical Erl&ouml;serkirche in the Muristan (built in 1898 on land given by the German Emperor) with a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the Johanniterhospiz, Hospital of the Kaiserwerth Deaconesses, the Leper-house kept by the Moravians, and the Syrian <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. In 1841, by arrangement between the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> and English governments, an Anglo-Lutheran "Bishopric of St. James" at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was founded. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to be appointed alternately by the two governments and to have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Chaldea, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. This is the famous "Jerusalem <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>" that gave so great <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Michael Samuel Alexander (appointed by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), 1842-5; Samuel Gobat von Cremines (by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>), 1845-79; Joseph Barclay (by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), 1879-81. Already during Gobat's time the two elements had drifted apart; when Barclay died, the arrangement fell through.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> have now a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> "in" <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> of quite a different type (since 1887). Bishop Blyth and his <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a> are conciliatory to all the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> and on excellent terms with the Orthodox patriarch. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Collegiate Church of St. George (with a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>) is the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It is situated outside the city to the north, beyond the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. St. Paul's Church belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society (outside, northwest); there is a large <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (founded by Bishop Gobat) at the southwest corner of the walls. The <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> Society has a church, two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The following <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> use the title of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in some form: <ul><li><em><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>:</em> the Latin Patriarch, residing in the city; the Melkite <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and all the East, residing at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> or Damascus; the Melkite Patriarchal Vicar of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> residing at <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Jaffa</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Patriarchal Vicar of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> residing in the city; <li><em>Non-Catholics:</em> the Orthodox Patriarch residing in the city; the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Patriarch residing in the city; the Jacobite Maphrian (Metropolitan of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) residing with his Patriarch (of Antioch) in the Zapharan <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Mardin; the Jacobite Vicar of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (for the Maphrian) residing in the city; the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (or the East or the Anastasis) residing at Cairo; the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</ul>
