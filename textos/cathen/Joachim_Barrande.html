<h1>Joachim Barrande</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> pal&aelig;ontologist, b. at Sangues (Haute-Loire), 11 August, 1799; d. at Frohsdorff, near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 5 October, 1883. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the EcogPolytechnique in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was selected by Charles X to be the tutor of his grandson, the Duc de Bordeaux, also known as the Count de Chambord. When the king abdicated in 1830 he accompanied the royal family to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and finally to Prague. He continued throughout his life on terms of intimate friendship with the duke, who, after the death of the king, took up his residence at Frohsdorff, and he acted also as the <a href="../cathen/01143a.htm">administrator</a> of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Barrande's interest was early awakened in the fossil remains of his adopted country and their distribution in the various strata. The field was a new one for until the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his first publication scarcely any attention had been paid to stratigraphical geology and <a href="../cathen/11410a.htm">pal&aelig;ontology</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. During the summers of 1840-50 he made preliminary surveys on foot of the Silurian district, an area of about 140 sq. miles. This was the beginning of his extensive investigations on the Silurian system of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Quarries were opened and workmen engaged to search for fossils, and for forty-three years he devoted his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and resources to the vast undertaking and especially to describing, naming, and figuring the numerous specimens which he discovered. The results of his labours are contained in his great work&mdash;"Syst&egrave;me silurien de centre de la Boh&ecirc;me&mdash;which stands almost unrivalled in <a href="../cathen/11410a.htm">pal&aelig;ontological</a> literature" (von Zittel). The first volume was published in 1852 and at the time of his death twenty-two large quarto volumes with 1160 plates had appeared. Barrande was also the author of "Colonie dans le bassin silurien de la Boh&ecirc;me" (1860); "Documents sur la faune primordiale et le syst&egrave;me taconique en Am&eacute;rique" (1861); "Repr&eacute;sentation de colonies de la Boh&ecirc;me dans le bassin silurien du nord-ouest de la France" (1863); "Cephalopodes&mdash;Etudes g&eacute;n&eacute;rales". His private life was simple and uneventful. He carried on a correspondence with the leading geologists of other countries, some of whom visited him at Prague. At his death he provided means for the completion of his "Syt&eacute;me silurien" and bequeathed his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and valuable collection of fossils to the Natural History Museum at Prague.
