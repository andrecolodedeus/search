<h1>Jocelin of Wells</h1>  

<p>(Or JOSCELINE)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a> (JOCELINUS THOTEMAN), d. 19 Nov., 1242. He was probably a native of Wells in Somerset, though no details of his parentage have survived. In 1203 he was acting as one of the king's justiciars at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and in the same year he was one of the <em>custodes</em> of the vacant <a href="../cathen/09266a.htm">See of Lincoln</a>. He was already a canon of Wells and in 1203-4 he received two <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, Lugwardine and Urchenefeld in Herefordshire. When <a href="../cathen/13488b.htm">Savaric</a> attempted to gain possession of Glastonbury Abbey, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>: whereupon <a href="../cathen/13488b.htm">Savaric</a> sent Jocelin with the <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> of Wells to force them to withdraw their appeal. In the year 1205 <a href="../cathen/13488b.htm">Savaric</a> died and on 3 February, 1205-6 Jocelin was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his stead by the canons of Bath with the concurrence of the chapter of Wells. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/12673a.htm">Reading</a> on 28 May, 1206. Two years later he left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The king outlawed him and seized his estates, but these were restored in 1213, when John submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1215 he aided Stephen Langton to obtain Magna Charta and his name occurs in the charter as one of the king's counsellors.

<p>On the death of John, Jocelin and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> anointed and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the boy-king, Henry III, and he actively supported Hubert de Burgh in expelling the French forces which remained in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and in regaining for the king the royal castles which had been seized by Falkes de Breaute and other unruly barons. In 1218 he acted as one of the itinerant justiciars for the south-west of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and at the same time he brought to a close the long dispute between his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the Abbey of Glastonbury. He received some manors in return for the surrender of his claims and was thenceforth known as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>. The proceeds of these manors he devoted to the work of rebuilding Wells <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, an old English building with a Norman choir. Jocelin built the existing <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and choir. The west front and the flower part of the three towers were also his work. His <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 23 Oct., 1239. He also built the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, began the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, and erected a manor house at Wookey. He drew up constitutions for the church, insisted on the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, increased their common fund, and endowed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with houses and land. He founded with his brother, Bishop <a href="../cathen/07519c.htm">Hugh of Lincoln</a>, St. John's Hospital at Wells. At his own desire he was buried in the choir of the cathedral. A calendar of his episcopal charters and deeds is given in the report of the Historical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> Commission on the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Wells <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
