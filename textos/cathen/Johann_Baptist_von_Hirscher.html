<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Johann Baptist von Hirscher</h1>  

<p>Born 20 January, 1788, at Alt-Ergarten, Ravensburg; died 4 September, 1865. He studied at <a href="../cathen/15577d.htm">Weissenau</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the lyceum of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1810, he was for two years <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at R&ouml;hlingen; in 1812 he became a tutor in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>; and in 1814 assistant professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> lyceum. In 1817 he was elected to the chair of moral and pastoral theology in T&uuml;bingen University, where he remained twenty years. In 1837 he became professor of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and catechetics at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in the Breisgau, where, for a quarter of a century, he exerted a very great influence. He was made a canon in 1839, and dean of the chapter in 1850; after 1847 he was often sent as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the First Chamber of the Grand Duchy of Baden. His advanced age forced him to cease teaching in the summer of 1863.

<p>Hirscher exerted a great influence in the domain of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, homiletics, and catechetics. His book on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality, published in 1835, ran through five editions. He defined <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality as the scientific <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the effective return of man to the Divine filiation through the merits of Christ. In the earlier editions some of the expressions and opinions of Hirscher, owing to the influence of the day, were deserving of censure; be corrected them by degrees and <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> admits that the last editions are perfectly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. The book marked a reaction against <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> morality. Hirscher, always eager to dwell on religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, closely traced the moral act to a religious origin and a religious end, and he detested virtue that did not proceed from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Though not satisfactory from the point of view of confessors, Hirscher's work, as his <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a> says, had a salutary effect, and <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a> himself made use of it to bring an unbeliever to the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>In homiletics, also, Hirscher's books marked a reaction against the half-rationalistic books of meditation written by the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Zschokke, which were then widely read. Hirscher drew a distinction between <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <em>Aufkl&auml;rung</em>, which is purely negative and confined to combating <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <em>Aufkl&auml;rung</em>, which is based on the Gospel. He published commentaries on the Gospels of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (1829), on the Gospels of each Sunday (1837), and on the Epistles of each Sunday. To this field of Hirscher's activity belong his "Geschichte Jesu Christi, des Sohnes Gottes und Weitheilandes" (1839); his "Er&ouml;rterungen &uuml;ber die grossen religi&ouml;sen Fragen der Gegenwart" (1846), which led to the development of <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger's</a> vocation as an <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>; his "Leben der seligsten Jungfrau und Gottesmutter Maria" (1854); his "Hauptst&uuml;cke des christlichen Glaubens" (1857).

<p>His work on catechetics, published in 1840, was followed, in 1842, by a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, which was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Diocese of Freiburg</a> and gave rise to lively discussions. To defend his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, Hirscher published "Zur Verst&auml;ndigung &uuml;ber den von mir bearbeiteten und demn&auml;chst erscheinenden Katechismus der christkatholischen Religion" (1842), and "Nachtr&auml;ge zur Verst&auml;ndigung" (1843). When eighty years of age, he published a brochure entitled "Besorgnisse hinsichtlich der Zweckm&auml;ssigkeit unseres Religionsunterrichtes" (1863). He regarded the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> as the history of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. The first two books treat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creation, and the Redemption; the next three, of the individualization of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and of its coming within and without us, that is to say, of justification, sanctification, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the sixth book treats of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> in the other life. <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> criticized Hirscher for insisting too exclusively on the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works within us, and neglecting to emphasize the gratuitous creation of the new man by grace. However, such as it was, Hirscher's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> work, with <a href="../cathen/14302a.htm">Alban Stolz's</a> commentaries on it, helped to advance the teaching of religion in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>Hirscher's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were more complex and open to suspicion. As a young man he had written a work on the Mass entitled "De genuina miss&aelig; notione", in which the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the sacrifice was relegated to the background, and which was put on the Index. Later he was blamed for never having formally retracted the book; he answered that at least he had held quite <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> theories concerning the Mass in his later writings. Nevertheless a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were not reassured, and when in 1842 and the following years there was question of appointing Hirscher coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, the historian <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a> and his friend, Baron de Rinck, raised a cry of alarm. The "Schweizerische Kirchenzeitung" and the "Revue Sion" accused Hirscher of being an enemy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and everything Roman, of dreaming of a German national Church, of opposing <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, of preventing the Freiburg <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> review from attacking his benefactor <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a>, of being the friend of the Baden <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>. Hirscher replied in the "Revue Sion" (30 November, 1842), and Schleyer, dean of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, defended him in his book "Hirscher und seine Ankl&auml;ger". But Rinck continued to write to the effect that if Hirscher were accepted as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there would be a worse <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> than that of Ronge, and when the Government of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> wanted to have Hirscher appointed coadjutor to the aged Bishop Keller, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused. These suspicions were confirmed by the pamphlets Hirscher published in 1849, on the social condition of the present day and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, "Die socialen Zust&auml;nde der Gegenwart", and on the present state of religion, "Die kirchlichen Zust&auml;nde der Gegenwart". These brochures created a profound sensation, for in them Hirscher showed himself hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Associations' movement, which gave birth to the first general Congress of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at Mains, in 1848; he feared that the movement might lead to imprudent demonstrations by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. He preferred lay associations to be undenominational, and favoured a synodal organization in which the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> would be represented, and which should be periodically convened by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and presided over by them.

<p>Finally he showed himself opposed to the preaching of missions in villages. Several of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were aroused, and attention was drawn to the opinions in Hirscher's pamphlets that had been condemned already by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in his Constitution "Auctorem fidei". The canonist Phillips, the future <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Bishop Fessler</a>, and Fathers Amberger of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and Heinrich of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, refuted Hirscher. He was condemned by the Congregation of the Index, and submitted with sincerity, for which <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a> praises him; but he defended himself against his adversaries in another brochure. In 1854 Hirscher was hostile to the definition of the Immaculate Conception, though he was not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> itself; in 1862 after collaborating with <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> in drawing up the programme of the famous congress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scientists to be held at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, the following year, he quietly withdrew, judging that the time was not ripe for such a meeting. In the First Chamber of the Baden Diet Hirscher fought vigorously for the liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1848 he proposed a motion that the grand duke should be asked to employ "every means to preserve genuine <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, active and living, among all classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, especially among the young". In 1850 he asked that the grand duke should attend to the wants of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that he should grant without delay the establishment of three or four <em>petits s&eacute;minaires</em>, where future <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should be trained during the time of their gymnasium studies. In November, 1853, he drew up the address by which the chapter of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> allied itself with Archbishop Vicari in his struggle against the bureaucracy of the State, and defended Vicari in his brochure, "Zur Orientirung &uuml;ber den derzeitigen Kirchenstreit" (1854).

<p>Hirscher was an excellent <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom many of his contemporaries, according to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/09150b.htm">Canon Lennig</a>, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a patriarch, and for whom Mgr. Orbin, who died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, had a real devotion. He aroused some to enthusiasm: the celebrated publicist, <a href="../cathen/14302a.htm">Alban Stolz</a>, who did so much towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, collaborated with Hirscher, with whom he spent an evening each week, and on one occasion wrote a vehement letter to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had forbidden his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to study at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, for fear of their falling under the influence of Hirscher; he asserted even that at first he had placed the writings of Hirscher above those of the Fathers. Hirscher's misfortune was to have known too little of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity and especially of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. What he criticized under the name of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> in his pamphlet of 1823, on the relations of the Gospels with <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a>, were formul&aelig; of a handbook more impregnated with the philosophy of Wolf than with that of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Finally, the sometimes too bitter attacks of which he was the object prevented the diffusion of certain of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which would have been dangerous; but, on the other hand, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as a catechist, his exalted <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, his personal influence, the purity of his intentions, the ardour he displayed in his defence of Vicari, the part he played in the religious awakening in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, recognized by the "Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter" in 1854, won for Hirscher the gratitude of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
