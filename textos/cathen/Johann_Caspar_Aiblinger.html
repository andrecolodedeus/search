<h1>Johann Caspar Aiblinger</h1>  

<p>Composer, born 23 February, 1779, at Wasserburg, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 6 May 1867. In his eleventh year he commenced his studies at <a href="../cathen/14471b.htm">Tegernsee Abbey</a>, where he was instructed in piano and organ-playing. Four years later he entered the gymnasium at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, where he studied under Professor Schlett, his countryman. Thence he went (in 1800) to the University of Landshut. Inwardly drawn to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he completed his philosophy and began <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, but the secularization of many <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> prevented his entrance into a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. He now devoted himself solely to music. Led by the then prevailing <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that without a visit to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> no musical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is complete, he turned his footsteps southward. After a stay of eight years at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, where he fell under the influence of his countryman Simon Mayr, Aiblinger (1811) went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and there met Meyerbeer, who procured for him an appointment at the Conservatory. His failure to establish a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for classical music led him to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to assume the direction of the local ballet. On his return to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> King Max I invited him to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> to direct the Italian opera. King Ludwig appointed him director of the royal orchestra, and sent him to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to collect old Italian masterpieces. On his return be became the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> of the church of All Saints for which he wrote many valuable compositions. In 1864 he resigned, on account of advancing years. Between 1820 and 1830 he tried operatic composition, but was unsuccessful. A <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against Italian music, which led to the revival of Gluck's "Iphigenia in Tauris", followed. Then he took up <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>, studying the old masters and procuring performances of their works. He also wrote much <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>, which is generally full of simple dignity and great purity, with a certain degree of freedom, but it is stiff, dry, and weakly sentimental. His instrumentation is not strong. He was, however, inspired with the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Of his numerous compositions, comprising masses and requiems, offertories and graduals, psalms, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, and German <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, many have been published at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. His choicest works, consisting of masses, vespers, <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a>, etc. (133 in number), are preserved in the archives of the royal court <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>.
