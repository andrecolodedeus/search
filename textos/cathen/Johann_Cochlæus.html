<h1>Johann Cochl&aelig;us</h1>  

<p>(Properly Dobeneck), surnamed Cochl&aelig;us (from <em>cochlea</em>, a snail shell) after his birthplace Wendelstein, near Schwabach.

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialist, b. 1479; d. 11 Jan., 1552, in <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he received at the house of his uncle, Hirspeck. About 1500 he began his <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> studies under Grienniger at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>. From 1504 he pursued his studies at Cologne and there relations sprang up between Cochl&aelig;us and the champions of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a>. In 1510 he obtained the rectorate in the Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, where the "Quadrivium Grammatices" (1511 and repeatedly afterwards) and the "Tetrachordum Musices" appeared. At <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> he became an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Pirkheimer</a>. With the latter's three nephews he went to Bologna to continue his <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> and legal studies. His main object, however, was to pursue a course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in which he obtained his doctorate in 1517, and then by the advice of <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Pirkheimer</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There, under the influence of the Oratorio del Divino Amore, Cochl&aelig;us turned his attention to the cultivation of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he went to Frankfort, and after some hesitation, arising no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> from consideration for his friends, he entered the arena as the opponent of the <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheran movement</a>. His first works were "De Utroque Sacerdotio" (1520) and several smaller writings published in rapid succession. In 1521 he met the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Aleander at Worms and worked untiringly to bring about the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. During the following years he wrote tracts against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> principal theses on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification, on the freedom of the will, and on the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (especially the important work, "De Gratia Sacramentorum", 1522; "De Baptismo parvulorum", 1523; "A commentary on 154 Articles"; etc). <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, to the vexation of Cochl&aelig;us wrote in answer only a single work, "Adversus Armatum Virum Cocleum".

<p>After a short sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Cochl&aelig;us accompanied Compeggio to the negotiations at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran movement</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> drove him to Cologne in 1525. From there he wrote against the rebellion and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, its real author. In 1526 he received a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at Mayence and accompanied Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg to the Diet of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>. After <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Emser's</a> death Cochl&aelig;us took his place as secretary to Duke George of Saxony, whom he defended against an attack of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> based on the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> charge of an alliance between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> (cf. The Affaire of Otto v. Pack). Conjointly with Duke George he laboured strenuously in 1530, to refute the Augsburg Confession, and later directed against <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, its author, his bitter "Philippicae". Because of a pamphlet against <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII of England</a> he was transferred in 1535 to a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>. After the duke's death, owing to the advance of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, his further stay in Saxony became quite impossible. For the time being he found a refuge as canon first at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> and later at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>. With indomitable ardour he published pamphlet after pamphlet against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, against <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Butzer</a>, Bullinger, Cordatus, Ossiander, etc. Almost all of these publications, however, were written in haste and bad temper, without the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> revision and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> thoroughness, consequently they produced no effect on the masses. His greatest work against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> is his strictly historical "Commentaria de Actis et Scriptis M. Luther" (extending to his death), an armoury of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> polemics for all succeeding time. Forced to resign his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a> in 1548, Cochl&aelig;us remained for a short time in Mayence to edit a work of Abbot Conrad Braun. In 1549, however, he returned to Breslau where he died shortly after. Naturally of a quiet and studious disposition he was drawn into the arena of polemics by the religious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. There he developed a productivity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> unparalleled by any other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of his time. He did not, however, possess the other requisites for success in the same degree. Among his two hundred and two publications (catalogued in Spahn, p. 341 sq.) Are to be found, besides tracts bearing on the topics of the day, also editions of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers and historical publications. Among these latter the work "Historiae Hussitarum XII Libri" (1549) is of great value even today because of the authorities used therein.
