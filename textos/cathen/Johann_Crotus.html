<h1>Johann Crotus</h1>  

<p>(Properly Johannes J&auml;ger, hence often called VENATOR, "hunter", but more commonly, in grecized form, CROTUS, "archer').

<p>German Humanist, b. at Dornheim, in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, c. 1480; d. probably at Halle, c. 1539. From the name of his birthplace he received the latinized appellation Rubianus and is generally known as Crotus Rubianus. At the age of eighteen he went to the University of Erfurt, then the chief centre of German <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, where he obtained his baccalaureate degree in 1500. Friendship with Conrad Mutianus and Ulrich von Hutten led him from being an upholder of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> to become an enthusiastic partisan of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and a violent opponent of the older learning. In 1505 he induced von Hutten to leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, but in 1506 came back with the latter from Cologne to Erfurt, where in 1508 Crotus obtained a degree of Master of Arts. After this he was absent from Erfurt for a short time as tutor to Count von Henneberg, but by 1509 he had again returned to his studies and in 1510 was the head of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. He now formed close relations with Reuchlin and Reuchlin's supporters in Cologne; about 1514 he was for a short time in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, but soon returned to <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and obtained a small <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. About 1515 he wrote the larger part of the "Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum"; the letters composed by him are the most violent in character, full of venom and stinging scorn against <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> and monasticism. In 1517 he settled in Bologna as tutor of the Fuchs brothers, and during his stay at this city, up to 1519, he studied successively <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Before leaving <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he went in company with Eoban <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1519) in order to observe for himself the "see of corruption". While in Bologna he had become acquainted with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> writings and actions, learned of the violent stand he had taken and approved it as the beginning of a greatly needed reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; apparently also he had a share in the anonymous broadsides which appeared in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. From 1520 he was again in Erfurt where he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and here in 1521 he gave <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> a warm greeting when the latter passed through Erfurt on his way to Worms. Soon after this Crotus returned to <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> where <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melancthon</a> visited him in 1524. In the same year Crotus entered the service of Duke Albrecht of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> at K&ouml;nigsberg and endeavoured to justify the duke's withdrawal from the old Faith in a pamphlet directed against the new master of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> entitled "Chirstliche Vermahnung" (1526).

<p>Weary of his position at K&ouml;nigsburg as early as 1529, he went first, in 1530, to <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, and soon afterwards to Halle; here Crotus accepted service under Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg as councillor and received a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a>. As a genuine Humanist Crotus had for a long time felt disgusted with the public disturbance and bitter polemics that resulted from the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran movement</a>; he was still more dissatisfied with the grave disorder in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and religion. Thus in Halle, probably through the influence of its canons, he positively returned to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, which he seems, however, never to have abandoned consciously. The first clear notice of this change of views is the "Apologia, qua respondetur temeritati calumniatorum non verentium confictis criminibus in populare odium protrahere reverendissimum in Christo patrem et dominum Albertum". (Leptzig, 1531). The "Apologia" contained a positive denial of the accusations made by Alexander Crosner or <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> that Cardinal Albrecht, in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and in his opposition to granting the cup to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, had acted with extreme cruelty and lack of consideration. Crotus showed that the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had resulted in the sanctioning of all kinds of immorality and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and that where the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">"Antipopes"</a> ruled, those of other <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> were cruelly oppressed, denounced by spies and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Various pamphlets, chiefly anonymous, were issued in reply to the "Apologia" and the author was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked by Justus Jonas and other of his former friends. After this <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> always gave the name of Dr. Kr&ouml;te (toad) to his one-time adherent, the dreaded opponent in former days of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> and monasticism. Suspicion was often thrown on the motives for the inner change in Crotus. His connexion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was attributed to desire for princely favour and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of gain. But there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that his resolution was a deliberate one and that he belonged to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> party only so long as he hoped in this way to attain a reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>As soon as there was a formal break with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the pretended reform movement produced only <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> in religion and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, he turned his back on it without giving a thought to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his friends of earlier days. In a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1532 to Duke Albrecht he states his religious views clearly: "with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> he intends to remain in communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and allow all innovations to pass over like a disagreeable smoke". Crotus appears to have spent the last years of his life entirely at Halle, but nothing positive is known on the subject. Most probably <a href="../cathen/15680a.htm">Georg Witzel</a> urged him at different times to write again in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he seems, indeed, to have made an effort to do this. But afterwards we hear that the position, "unworthy of a man", in which he was placed, did not permit him to take up his pen on behalf of religion. It is not entirely certain whether his <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> or his character of official in the service of Cardinal Albrecht laid these limitations on him. Yet he apparently had an important influence on the writings of others as, e.g. on those of <a href="../cathen/15680a.htm">Witzel</a>. Crotus himself as a <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> of strong <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> tastes, preferred above all the quiet of his study. It may be that the revolutionary tumult in religious and social life took from him both the desire and the strength to use the pen which had formerly so unmercifully scourged the weaknesses of his opponents. He seems, however, to have influenced the religious demeanour of his master, Cardinal Albrecht, in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> later years. The last scanty information concerning Crotus reaches to the year 1539; his death occurred, if not in this year, certainly not much later.
