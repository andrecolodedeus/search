<h1>Johann Faber</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. at Leutkirch, in Swabia, 1478; d. in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 21 May, 1541.

<p>He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> and <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg in the Breisgau</a>; was made doctor of sacred <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in Freiburg; became in succession minister of Lindau, Leutkirch; <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, 1518; <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and confessor to King Ferdinand I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 1524; was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1530. While a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Basle he formed a friendship with <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> that lasted throughout their lives; <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> persuaded Faber to take up the study of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>.

<p>Like others of his time Faber was at first friendly with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, and Oecolampandius, sympathizing with their efforts at reform and opposing certain abuses himself; but when he realized that neither <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself was spared by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, he broke with them and became their most consistent opponent. He wrote his first polemic against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, "Opus adversus nova quaedam dogmata Martini Lutheri" (1552). This was soon followed by his "Malleus Haereticorum, sex libris ad Hadrianum VI summum Pontificem" (Cologne, 1524; Rome, 1569). From this latter work he is sometimes called the "hammer of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>". He entered into public debate with <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>; was prominent in all the diets held to restore peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and was one of the committee appointed to draw up a refutation of the Confession of Augsburg. On some points, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>, he was willing to recognize certain unfortunate conditions if an agreement could be reached to prevent similar conditions in the future, but no agreement was possible. He was sent by Ferdinand to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and then to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to seek aid against the invading <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; Ferdinand also had him enlist the services of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> to combat the spread of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was unbounded; he protected his flock by frequent preaching and numerous writings, and he held regular conferences with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He founded twelve scholarships for boys who wished to become <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but did not have the means to realize their <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>.

<p>His works (German and Latin) are homiletical and polemical in character. Besides those already mentioned he wrote treatises on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>; an instruction and answer to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> work against the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; a treatise against the more recent tenets of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; a comparison of the writings of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; the power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; an answer to six articles of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>; defence of catholic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> against the chief <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a>, Balthasar of Friedberg; a book on the religion of the Russians; sermons on the misery of life and on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; sermons of consolation and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> while the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were besieging <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. His works in three folio volumes (Cologne, 1537-40) do not contain his polemical writings; these are found in "Opuscula quaedam Joannis Fabri, Episcopi Viennensis (Leipzig, 1539).
