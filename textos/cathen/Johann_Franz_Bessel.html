<h1>Johann Franz Bessel</h1>  

<p>(In <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religion</a> <em>Gottfried</em>)

<p>Benedictine, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and historian, b. 5 September, 1672, at Buchen, in the Grand-duchy of Baden; d. at <a href="../cathen/06682b.htm">G&ouml;ttweig</a>, 22 January, 1749. He made his course in the humanities at Aschaffenburg, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and Bamberg, and in 1690 entered the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, where he specialized in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, also attending lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. Attracted by the learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of his teachers, he resolved to become a religious and entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/06682b.htm">G&ouml;ttweig</a> on the Danube, Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 15 June, 1692. After making his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (21 June, 1693), he completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> (21 March, 1696), and on 23 May was granted the degree of Doctor of Theology, being shortly afterwards appointed Lector in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Seligenstadt on the Main. In 1699 he was summoned to the electoral court of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> by Archbishop Lothar Franz von Sch&ouml;nborn, who immediately sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study the curial practice of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> Romana. Having completed a two years' course in law, he obtained the degree of <em>Doctor Juris Utriusque</em>, and on his return to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1703) he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and supreme judge of the whole archdiocese by his benefactor. He was also employed on various diplomatic missions, as, for instance, to the court of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel in connection with the conversion of Duke Anton Ulrich and his granddaughter, the Princess Elisabeth Christine, later the wife of Emperor Charles VI. He made three journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to settle differences between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor concerning the limits of the province of Commacchio. On 7 February, 1714, he was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of G&ouml;ttweig, and from that time forward was commissioned by the emperor to conduct diplomatic negotiations, in addition to being made imperial <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and serving twice as honorary <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>.

<p>Abbot Bessel was the second founder of G&ouml;ttweig, which became, under his rule of thirty-five years, a centre of learning. He added to the rare Hebrew, Greek, and Roman <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and bracteates collections of copper-plate engravings (over 20,000), minerals, shells, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. By the expenditure of princely sums he enriched the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> with thousands of volumes, chiefly on historical subjects, as well as <em>incunabula</em> and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> Himself a thorough scholar, he encouraged among his religious all undertakings of a scientific or artistic nature. When the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was almost totally destroyed by fire, he gathered, by judicious management, means sufficient to rebuild it on a more splendid scale.

<p>Personally, Abbot Bessel was a retiring religious, presenting to all a shining example of monastic <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Besides several comparatively unimportant works, such as "Mararita pretiosa", "Curiae Romanae praxis", and "Austriae ritus", he published (Vienna, 1732) two letters of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to Optatus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a>, which had been until then unknown. He is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> credited with the authorship of "Quinquaginta Romano-catholicam fidem omnibus aliis praeferendi motiva" (Mainz, 1708), a controversial work written originally in Latin, but translated into almost every <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> tongue. The work which brought him lasting renown and a place in the records of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history is entitled "Chronicon Gottwicense, tomus prodromus" (Tegernsee, 1732). Not, as might be thought, a history of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, this single volume is a comprehensive work on German diplomatics, treating of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> found in registers and archives, original documentary evidence, diplomas of German emperors and kings, and inscriptions and seals, illustrated with maps and engravings on copper. The author also discusses <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> geography, as well as the royal palace-domains (<em>Pfalzen</em>) and the various districts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Great learning and clear critical acumen distinguish this work, which marked an epoch in the history of German diplomatics, and has served as the basis of all later works on the same subject.
