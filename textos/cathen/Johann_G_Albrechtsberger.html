<h1>Johann G. Albrechtsberger</h1>  

<p>Master of musical theory, and teacher of Hummel and <a href="../cathen/15265b.htm">Beethoven</a>, b. at Klosterneuburg in Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 3 February, 1736; d. in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 7 March 1809. He began his musical career as a choir-boy at the early age of seven. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Martin's, Klosterneuburg, observing the boy's talent and his remarkable industry, and being himself an excellent musician, gave him the first lessons in thoroughbass, and even had a little <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> built for him. Young Albrechtsberger's <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was so great that he did not even rest on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holidays. To complete his scientific and musical studies he repaired to the <a href="../cathen/10167a.htm">Benedictine Abbey at Melk</a>. Here his beautiful soprano voice attracted the attention of the future Emperor Leopold, who on one occasion expressed his high appreciation and presented the boy with a ducat. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10167a.htm">Melk</a> gave him the opportunity to study the works of Caldara Fux, Pergolese, Handel, Graun etc. The result was the profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of music which gave him a high rank among theorists. Having completed his studies he became <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there, where he remained for twelve years. He next had charge of the choir at Raab in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and at Mariatfel. Subsequently he went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> having been named choir-director of the church of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. Here he took lessons from the court <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>, Mann, who was highly esteemed at that time. Mann became his friend, as did also <a href="../cathen/07158b.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/07158a.htm">Michael Haydn</a>, Gassmann, and other excellent musicians. In 1772 he obtained the position of court <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, which Emperor Joseph had promised him years before. This position he held for twenty years, and then became choir-master at St. Stephen's. Here he gathered about him a circle of pupils, some of whom were destined to become musicians of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> fame. Among them <a href="../cathen/15265b.htm">Ludwig von Beethoven</a>, Joseph Eybler, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Joseph Weigl and others. The Swedish Academy of Music at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> made him an honorary member in 1798. Albrechtsberger will probably always hold a high rank among musical scientists, his treatise on composition especially will ever remain a work of importance by reason of its lucidity and minuteness of detail. His complete works on thoroughbass, harmony and composition were published, in three volumes, by his pupil, Ignaz Von Seyfried. His many church compositions, on the other hand, while technically correct and ornate, are dry, and betray the theorist. Of his compositions, only twenty-seven are printed, out of a total of 261; of the unpublished remainder, the larger part is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <em>Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde at Vienna</em>.
