<h1>Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg</h1>  

<p>A celebrated German <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, b. at Schaffhausen, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 16 March, 1445; d. at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 10 March, 1510. Until a scientific presentation of the history of the development of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sermon appears, an appreciation of even the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, although based on careful investigation, can only be a preliminary labour, for the picture, however elaborate, will lack the proper background. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the case of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> preacher to the common people, <a href="../cathen/02521a.htm">Berthold of Ratisbon</a>, and it applies no less to the great <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator of the early sixteenth century, Geiler von Kaysersberg. More fortunate is the treatment of the subject in its relations to purely literary history, for the importance of Geiler in literature can be exactly determined. According to this history he was closely connected with those <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> of whom the leader was the well-known Jacob of <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling</a> (1450-1528), called "the educator of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>". Like <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling</a>, Geiler was a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>; both fought the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses of the age, but not in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his adherents. They looked, instead, for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and preservation only in the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> through the faithful maintenance of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The scene of <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling's</a> fruitful labours was the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, that of Geiler's the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>.

<p>The surname "von Kaysersberg", given to Geiler by his contemporaries, was taken from the name of the place where his grandfather, who brought him up, lived. The father was killed by a hunting-accident when Geiler was three years old; and the excellent grandfather, who lived in Kaysersberg, took charge of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the child, sending him to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Ammersweiher, near Kaysersberg in Alsace, where his mother lived. When the talented boy was fifteen years old he went to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in the Breisgau, which had just opened; two years later he received the baccalaureate, and after two more years was made <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master of arts</a>. He now gave lectures on various writings of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> in the next semester, and in the following half-year filled the office of dean of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty for a brief period. In May, 1471, he went to the University of Basle, also found but a short time before, in order to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and obtained the doctorate in 1475. At Basle he became acquainted with Sebastian Brant, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. While at Basle, Geiler preached his first sermons in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and greatly enjoyed his <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> labours; the confessional, however, caused him many difficulties of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Basle, nevertheless, was not to be the place where his powers were to find their permanent employment. At the entreaty of the students of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, the magistracy and citizens of that city obtained his appointment to the Freiburg University, of which he was elected <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> the next year. But lecturing to students was not congenial to him; his inclination was always for preaching, and in this latter office his talents found a life-work suited to them. For a time he preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, in which city he thought of making his permanent home, but a fortunate accident changed his plans. Peter Schott, senator of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, an important and influential citizen who had charge of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, urged strongly upon Geiler, now a well-known preacher, that his first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to the people of Alsace; accordingly Geiler resolved, notwithstanding the entreaties of the citizens of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, to settle in <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and pursuant to this decision he remained there the rest of his life.

<p>Before this date the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> had supplied the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. On account, however, of the frequent change of preachers and, above all, owing to some friction between the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, together with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the city authorities, desired to have a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> appointed to fill the office permanently. Consequently a special position, as preacher was made for Geiler, and he filled this appointment with apostolic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and intense <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for over thirty years. He not only preached, as required, every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and even daily during <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, but also, on special occasions, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the city and often outside of the city. His daily life, passed in this simple round of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, was only broken by occasional short journeys for which he apparently used his monthly holiday. Thus he frequently visited Frederick of Zollern, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, who was very friendly to him; once he was called to F&uuml;ssen on the River Lech by his patron the Emperor Maximilian, who desired his advice. He seems to have taken his short intervals of rest, when possible, for making <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, generally in the vicinity of his home, sometimes to distant spots. At <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> he met the Blessed Nikolaus of Fl&uuml;e, who was even then well known; another time he journeyed to Sainte-Baume, near <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, in order to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the grotto of St. Mary Magdalen. At home he lived very plainly, even austerely. It was only natural that a life of such incessant labour, one in which the powers were constantly exerted to the utmost and none of the comforts of ease were enjoyed, should soon wear out the bodily frame. A kidney trouble developed, to relieve which he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to visit annual the hot springs of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>; dropsy finally appeared, and he passed away on L&aelig;tare Sunday of the year above mentioned. The next day, in the presence of an immense multitude of people, he was buried at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> which had been especially built for him, and of which he had been for so many years the greatest ornament.

<p>The numerous volumes of Geiler's sermons and writings which have been published do not give a complete picture of the characteristic qualities of the preacher. <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a> had made Geiler an orator, and the aim Geiler sought, without regard to other considerations, was to produce the most powerful effect on his hearers. He prepared himself with great care for the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, writing out his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> beforehand, as his contemporary Beatus Rhenanus reports; those preparatory compositions, however, were drawn up, not in German, but in Latin. Only a very small part of the sermons that have been issued under his name are directly his. At a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> his addresses were taken down by others and published. The best critic of Geiler's works, the well-known writer on literary history, Prof. E. Martin of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, has made the attempt, in the "Allgemeine deutche Biographie", to give a summary of Geiler's genuine writings; according to him the authenticated writings number thirty-five. Notwithstanding this rich material, a proper appreciation of the extraordinary preacher is very difficult, because it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that any of the extant works give exactly what Geiler said. One thing, however, is evident from them, that the Strasburg preacher was a widely read man not only in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, but also in the secular literature of the day. This is shown by the sermons having Sebastian Brant's "Ship of Fools", which appeared in 1494, for their theme; these sermons attained the greatest popularity. Geiler displayed, also, exceptional facility in using public events to attract and hold the attention of his hearers. In originality of speech Geiler is in form, as in time, between <a href="../cathen/02521a.htm">Berthold of Ratisbon</a> and <a href="../cathen/01056a.htm">Abraham a Sancta Clara</a>, and perhaps the shortest and best characterization of the greatest preacher of the early <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period is indicated by this intermediate position; Berthold's homeliness of address showed only occasional lapses from the proprieties of speech, Geiler yielded oftener to the coarseness of his age, Abraham exceeded his contemporaries in unfortunate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> as to form and content.

<p>According to the testimony of contemporaries, the effect of Geiler's forcible and unusual sermons was at times very marked; but the decay of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> was by now too great for them to have a permanent effect. Geiler himself complained bitterly that neither <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were willing to join in a common reform. A man of austere morality; he never failed to show an apostolic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> towards both high and low, and exhibited an extraordinary daring in fighting vice and degeneracy of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. Hence his works are an important source for the history of the civilization of these degenerate times. There are no distinct statements regarding what he effected by his personal influence among his intimate friends, especially by his influence on the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the senator, Schott, upon <a href="../cathen/15649a.htm">Wimpheling</a> and Brant, who were, like Geiler, reformers in the best sense of the word, as well as, by his counsels, upon the Emperor Maximilian. Another striking merit of Geiler's oratory was that his thoughts were expressed in the language of ordinary life, which he used with unequalled skill. In his way posterity possesses, in Geiler's writings, an enduring source for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the speech, customs, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of the common people at the beginning of the sixteenth century. It is no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to take up a question warmly discussed, even in modern times, as to how a work of Geiler's came to be on the Index (cf. Reusch, "Der Index". I, 370) as in the last issue of the Index Geiler's name does not appear.
