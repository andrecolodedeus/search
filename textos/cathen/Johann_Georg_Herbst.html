<h1>Johann Georg Herbst</h1>  

<p>Born at Rottweil, in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, 13 January, 1787; died 31 July, 1836. His college course, begun in the gymnasium of his native city, was pursued in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Peter in the Black Forest and in 1806 Herbst registered at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. After some time spent in completing his mathematical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, he devoted his talents to mastering Oriental languages and Biblical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> under the tutorship of Johann Leonard <a href="../cathen/07515a.htm">Hug</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> Herbst went, in 1811, to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Meersburg, to prepare himself for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in March, 1812. Called at once to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> to discharge the office of repetent, he at the same time accepted the chair of Hebrew and Arabic at the newly-erected University of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, and, two years later, was promoted to the professorship of Oriental languages and <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. In 1817 the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> was transferred to T&uuml;bingen, and there, in addition to the courses already entrusted to him, Herbst taught introduction to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and Biblical arch&aelig;ology; he also occasionally was prevailed upon to lecture on New-Testament <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and pastoral theology. Those were heroic times for the young faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which, with such men as Sebastian Drey, J. B. Hirscher, and M&ouml;hler on its staff, and pupils of the stamp of J. C. Hefele, was rapidly winning a conspicuous place in the realm of scholarship.

<p>What the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity of Herbst was amidst his manifold occupations as a professor, may be gathered from his works. His first publication was a volume entitled: "Observationes qu&aelig;dam de Pentateuchi quatuor librorum posteriorum auctore et editore" (Gm&uuml;nd, 1817). From the foundation, in 1819, of the T&uuml;bingen "Theol. Quartalschrift", he was a steady contributor thereto; but his principal work, left unfinished, and perhaps slightly tainted by the then prevalent tendencies to <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, is an introduction to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which was completed and edited by his pupil <a href="../cathen/15587a.htm">Welte</a> (1841-44). In 1832 Herbst was appointed head librarian of the Royal University; but through overwork his health soon failed, and he died after a short sickness borne with admirable resignation. A remarkable linguist, thoroughly conversant with the vast literature of his favourite studies, endowed with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> critical acumen, Herbst possessed, moreover, in a high degree, the gift of imparting his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in a most clear, attractive, and appealing manner.
