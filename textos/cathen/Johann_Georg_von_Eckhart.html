<h1>Johann Georg von Eckhart</h1>  

<p>(Called Eccard before he was ennobled)

<p>German historian, b. at Duingen in the principality of Kalenberg, 7 Sept., 1664; d. at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 9 Feb., 1730. After a good preparatory training at Schulpforta he went to <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, where at first, at the desire of his mother, he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, but soon turned his attention to philology and history. On completing his course he became secretary to Field-Marshal Count Flemming, the chief minister of the Elector of Saxony; after a short time, however, he went to <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> to find a permanent position. Owing to his extensive learning he was soon useful to the famous historian Leibniz, who, in 1694, took Eckhart as assistant and was, until death, his large-hearted patron and generous friend. Through the efforts of Leibniz Eckhart was appointed professor of history at Helmstedt in 1706, and in 1714 councillor at <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. After the death of Leibniz he was made librarian and historiographer of the royal family of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and was soon after ennobled by Emperor Charles VI, to whom he had dedicated his work "Origines Austriacae". For reasons which have never been clearly explained he gave up his position, in 1723, and fled from <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, perhaps on account of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/04402a.htm">Corvey</a>, and thence to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Not long after this the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, Johann Philipp von Sch&ouml;nborn, appointed Eckhart his librarian and historiographer. In his work Eckhart was influenced by the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of French historians, and gave careful attention to the so-called auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, above all to diplomatics; he also strove earnestly to follow a strictly scientific method in his treatment of historical materials. Together with Leibniz he may be considered as a founder of the critical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of historical writing. Besides the help he rendered Leibniz, of whom he prepared an affectionately respectful obituary (in Murr, "Journal f&uuml;r Kunstgeschichte", VII), he issued a number of independent works. His chief work, while professor at Helmsted, is his "Historia studii etymologici linguae germanicae haetenus impensi" (Hanover, 1711), a literary and historical study of all works bearing on the investigation of the Teutonic languages. At <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> he compiled a "Corpus historicum medii aevi" (Leipzig, 1723), in two volumes; at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> he published the "Commentarii de rebus Franciae Orientalis et episcopatus Wirceburgensis" (1729), also in two volumes, an excellent work whose rich materials are treated with scientific exactness.
