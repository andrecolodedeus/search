<h1>Johann Grueber</h1>  

<p>A German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and noted explorer of the seventeenth century; b. at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, 28 October, 1623; d. in 1665. He joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1641, and went to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1656, where he was active at the court of Peking as professor of mathematics and assistant to <a href="../cathen/13520a.htm">Father Adam Schall von Bell</a>. In 1661 his superiors sent him, together with the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Father Albert de Dorville (D'Orville), to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on business concerning the order. As it was impossible to journey by sea on account of the blockade of <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, they conceived the daring <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of going overland to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Thibet</a>. This led to Grueber's memorable journey (Dorville died on the way), which won him fame as one of the most successful explorers of the seventeenth century (Tonnier). They first travelled to Sinning-fu, on the borders of Kan-su; thence, through the Kukunor territory and Kalmuck Tartary (Desertum Kalnac), to the "Holy City" of Lhasa in Thibet; crossed, amid countless difficulties and hardships, the mountain passes of the Himalayas; arrived at Nepal, and thence passed over the Ganges plateau to Patna and <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>. This journey lasted two hundred and fourteen days. Dorville died at <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, a victim of the hardships he had undergone. Grueber, accompained by a Sanskrit Scholar, <a href="../cathen/13206a.htm">Father Henry Roth</a>, followed the overland route through <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and succeeded in reaching <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. His journey produced a sensation similar to that aroused its our times by the explorations of Sven Hedin. It showed the possibility of a direct overland connection between <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and the value and significance of the Himalayan passes. Tonnier says: "It is due to Grueber's energy that <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> received the first correct information concerning Thibet and its inhabitants". Although Oderico of Pordenone had traversed Thibet, in 1327, and visited Lhasa, he had not written any account of this journey. <a href="../cathen/01468d.htm">Antonio de Andrada</a> and Manuel Marquez had pushed their explorations as far as Tsparang on the northern Setledj. In 1664 Grueber set out to return to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, attempted to push his way through <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return, and then undertook the land route to <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. He was taken sick in Constantinople and died in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, or, according to others, in Patak, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>.

<p>An account of this first journey through Thibet in modern times was published by <a href="../cathen/08661a.htm">Father Athanasius Kircher</a> to whom Grueber had left his journals and charts, which he had supplemented by numerous verbal and written additions ("China illustrata", <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, 1667, 64-67). In the French edition of "China" (Amsterdam, 1670) is also incorporated a letter of Grueber written to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. For letters of Grueber see "Neue Welt-Bott" (Augsburg and Gratz, 1726), no. 34; Th&eacute;venot (whose acquaintance Grueber had made in Constantinople), "Divers voyages curieux" (Paris, 1666, 1672, 1692), II; extracts in Ritter, "Asien" (Berlin, 1833), II, 173; III, 453; IV, 88, 183; Anzi, "Il genio vagante" (Parma, 1692), III, 331-399.
