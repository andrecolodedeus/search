<h1>Johann Heynlin of Stein</h1>  

<p>(A LAPIDE)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born about 1425; died at Basle, 12 March, 1496. He was apparently of Swabian origin. On the completion of his academic studies in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, presumably at Leipzig and Freiburg, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to pursue the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Here he came in contact with the foremost representatives of Realism, who, recognizing his abilities and probable future influence, exerted their powers to the utmost to mould his mind after their own and thus make him like themselves a bitter opponent of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>. Their efforts were successful. In 1464 he went to the University of Basle and applied for admission to the professorial <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>. The old controversy regarding the nature of <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a> had not yet subsided and in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of Basle <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> held sway. Hence in view of this and the maintenance of peace within the institution, the admission of Heynlin to the faculty was not accomplished without a most vigorous opposition. Once a member of the faculty he hoped to rid it of all Nominalistic tendencies nor was he disappointed in his expectation. In 1465 he became dean of the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> and in this capacity he revised the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and thus brought about a firmly established curriculum of studies. In 1466 he returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, obtained the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was in 1469 elected <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and became professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. His most noteworthy achievement was the establishment, in connexion with Fichet, of the first printing-press in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1470; Ulrich Gering and his two associates were put in charge of it and Heynlin gave valuable pecuniary aid to their undertakings, especially for the printing of the works of the Fathers. In 1478 he was called to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the newly founded <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>, where his learning, eloquence and reputation secured for him the same year the rectorship. The opposition, however, he met from the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> Gabriel Biel, Paul Scriptoris, and others, rendered his service here of short duration. He severed his connexion with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, proceeded to Baden-Baden and thence to <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, where he engaged in preaching. Dissatisfied with Berne he returned to Basle, and tired of wandering, he entered in 1487 the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Monastery of St. Margarethenthal to spend his declining years in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and literary work. As a scholar and academic disputant Heynlin manifested an erudition and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> acumen of no mean order. Naturally of a peaceful disposition he was often forced by circumstances to play an important part in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies of his time. At his suggestion Johann Amerbach, the early printer of Basle, undertook the editing of the works of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writers. Of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works the only important one thus far issued is the "Resolutorium dubiorum circa missarum celebrationem".
