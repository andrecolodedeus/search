<h1>Johann Ignaz von Felbiger</h1>  

<p>A German <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reformer, pedagogical writer, and canon regular of the Order of St. Augustine, b. 6 January, 1724, at Gross-Glogau in Silesia; d. 17 May, 1788, at Presburg in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He was the son of a postmaster, who had been ennobled by Emperor Charles VI. The death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> constrained him, after studying <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, to accept (1744) the position of teacher in a private <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. In 1746 he joined the Order of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> at Sagan in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1748, and ten years later became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sagan. Noting the sad condition of the local <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, he strove to remedy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by publishing his first school-ordinance in 1761. During the private journey to <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, in 1762, he was favourably impressed with Hecker's Realschule and H&auml;hn's method of instructing by initials and tables (<em>Literal-</em> or <em>Tabellen-methode</em>), and became an enthusiastic propagator of this method. A school-ordinance for the dependencies of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sagan was issued in 1763, teachers' college was established, and Felbiger's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> reforms soon attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> alike. He was supported by the Silesian minister von Schlabrendorff, and at the latter's request, after a second journey to Berlin he elaborated general school-ordinance for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Silesia (1765). Three graded catechisms, the joint work of the prior and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Sagan, appeared in 1766 under the title, "Silesian Catechism", and enjoyed a wide circulation. The death of von Schlabrendorff in 1769 marked the end of the <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesian</a> government's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> efforts. Felbiger's suggestions were heeded, however, by King <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> in regulations issued (1774) for Silesian higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>At the request of the empress, <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, he repaired to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1774, and was appointed General Commissioner of Education for all the German lands of her dominions. The same year he published general school-ordinance, and in 1775 his most important pedagogical production: "Methodenbuch f&uuml;r Lehrer der deutschen Schulen". His school-reform was copied by <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and other German lands and was not without influence on <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Considerable opposition, aroused by Felbiger's arbitrariness, developed in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> against his plan of founding special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the neglected instruction of soldiers. <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, however, always remained his faithful protectress. Put his strictly religious principles <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> displeased <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, who depraved him his position, assigned him to his provostship at Presburg, and advised him to look after <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> interests in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1782). The chief peculiarity of Felbiger's too mechanical method was the use of tables containing the initials of the words which expressed the lesson to be imparted. Other features were the substitution of class-instruction for individual instruction and the practice of questioning the pupils. He aimed at raising the social standing, financial condition, and professional qualification of the teaching body, at giving a friendly character to the mutual relations between teacher and pupil. For a list of his 78 publications, which are mainly of a pedagogical character, see Panholzer's "Methodenbuch" (46-66).
