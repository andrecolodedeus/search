<h1>Johann Joseph Gassner</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>; b. 22 Aug., 1727, at Braz, Vorarlberg, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; d. 4 April, 1779, at Pondorf, on the Danube (<a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>); studied at Prague and <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1750, and after serving various missions, became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and dean of Pondorf May, 1776. A few years after his appointment to Klosterle in the <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Diocese of Chur</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> (1758), his health began to fall, so that he was scarcely able to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his ministry; he consulted various physicians in vain; suddenly he conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that his infirmities might be due to the influence of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> and might be cured by spiritual means. His experiment was successful. He applied this method also to others and soon thousands came to him to be healed. The fame of these cures spread far and wide; he was invited to the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, to <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and other places; everywhere he had the same success.

<p>He was convinced that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">evil spirit</a> could harm the body as well as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and hence that some infirmities were not the result of natural agencies, but were caused by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>. Only cases of the latter kind were taken up; he applied the <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and commanded the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one to depart from the afflicted, in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. To find out whether the disease was caused naturally or not, he applied the "probative exorcism", i.e. he commanded the spirit to indicate by some sign has presence in the body. And only then he made use of the "expulsive <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>". His proceedings were not secret; anyone of good standing, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, was admitted. People of all classes, nobles, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, physicians, and others often gathered around him to see the marvels they had heard of. Official records were made, competent witnesses testified to the extraordinary happenings. The character of the work made many enemies for him, but also many stanch friends and supporters. One of his bitterest opponents was the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> professor Johannes Semler of Halle. Also the physician Mesmer pretended that the cures were performed by the animal magnetism of his invention, but he was afraid of confronting Gassner. Among his friends were the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> minister, Lavater of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, and especially Count Fugger, the Prince-Bishhop of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>.

<p>Official investigations were made by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>; and all were favourable to Gassner, except that they recommended more privacy and decorum. The <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> appointed a commission, and so did the Imperial Government; they ended with the approval of Gassner's procedure. In fact, he never departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching or instructions concerning <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, and always disclaimed the name of wonder-worker. He was an exemplary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and altogether unselfish in his works of mercy.
