<h1>Johann Joseph Ignaz von D&ouml;llinger</h1>  

<p>A historian and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 28 February, 1799; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 10 January, 1890.
<h2>Family and education</h2>

<p>D&ouml;llinger's father was a professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and his son was influenced, in an unusual degree, by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> traditions and his whole environment. The medical faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> owed its foundation to his grandfather, whose son, the father of Ignaz (as D&ouml;llinger was usually called), became regular professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1794 but in 1803 was called to Wurzburg. It was only natural that amid surroundings predominantly academic the youthful Ignaz should acquire a strong <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of books, the best of which were then written in French, which language the future historian of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> learned from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. In the Gymnasium he acquired a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Italian. A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> taught him English privately and he learned Spanish at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. An orderly acquisition of learning and the full development of all his rich gifts would have led to extraordinary achievements. He had also sufficient means to satisfy any reasonable wishes for foreign travel and the purchase of books. All these circumstances, doubtless, combined to render his mind particularly receptive; at the same time the multitude of impressions daily made on the young student led him to outline a plan of studies by far too comprehensive.

<p>On entering the <a href="../cathen/15720a.htm">University of W&uuml;rzburg</a> at the age of sixteen, he took up at once history, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, philology and the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. In this choice there is already evident a certain <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> irregularity the more remarkable if we recall what he said, two years later, apropos of his choice of a vocation, viz., that, "no professor in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> had been able to attract him to his particular <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>". The conversion of such men as <a href="../cathen/05273c.htm">Eckhart</a>, Werner, Schlegel, <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Stolberg</a>, and Winkelmann turned his thoughts to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which he took up in 1818, but without abandoning botany, mineralogy, and entomology, to which studies he continued for many years to devote considerable time. We quote from Friedrich the following noteworthy utterance of D&ouml;llinger: "To most other students <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was only a means to the end. To me, on the contrary, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in general based on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, was the end, the choice of a vocation only the means." During his student days he seldom attended the regular lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> but he was assiduous at the lectures in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and law; privately, however, he read many works on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. His studies were better regulated when in 1820 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and followed the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses given at the Iyceum. The year and a half spent in this manner made up, but not sufficiently, for the previous lack of a systematic training in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 22 April, 1822, spent the summer at his home, and in November, was appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Markscheinfeldt in Middle Franconia. Despite the profound grasp of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> that his works at times exhibit, his career gives evidence enough that he never took the pains to round out satisfactorily the insufficiency of his early training in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The elder D&ouml;llinger had hoped to see his son follow an academic career and opposed his choice of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; among the reasons for his opposition was the conviction, openly expressed (and then prevalent enough among the German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>), that for physiological reasons a <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a> life was impossible.
<h2>Career</h2>

<p>D&ouml;llinger's father soon obtained (November, 1823) for him a place as professor of canon law and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> in the lyceum of Aschaffenburg. It was here that in 1826 he published his first work "Die Eucharistie in den drei ersten Jahrhunderten" an eloquent and solid treatise, still much appreciated. It obtained for him from the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> University of Landshut the title of Doctor of Theology <em>in absenti&acirc;</em>. In the same year he was called to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> as professor extraordinary of canon law and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and in 1827 was made professor in ordinary. In 1839 the king gave him a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in the royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (<em>Hofkollegiatstift</em>) of St. Cajetan at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and on 1 Jan 1847, he was made mitred <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> or head of that body of canons. In the same year he was dismissed from his chair, in punishment of his protest as representative of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Landtag, to which he had been appointed in 1844, against the dismissal of several <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors. But in 1848 he was chosen representative to the Frankfort Parliament and remained in attendance until the middle of 1849. Then followed (24 Dec., 1849, according to some authorities 1 Jan., 1850) his reappointment as professor, which office he held until 18 April, 1871, when Archbishop von Scherr publicly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him. Thereupon he laid down his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charges, recognized the binding force of his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and, though he held his professorate another year, taught only a course of modern history. In 1868 King Louis II of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> had appointed him royal councillor, and maintained him in his office as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Cajetan, even after his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; practically, this meant only the continuance to him of the revenue of the position. D&ouml;llinger received in 1873 another evidence of the royal favour when, on the death of the famous chemist Liebig, he was named by the king to the presidency of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences and general conservator of the scientific collections of the State. As early as 1837 he had been made member extraordinary of the Academy, in 1843 a regular member, and from 1860 was secretary of its historical section.

<p>Many attempts were made, by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, to induce D&ouml;llinger to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The personal conviction of the latter may be read in his correspondence (edited by Friedrich, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1899-1901) with Archbishop Steichele and the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Monsignor Ruffo-Scilla. In 1886 and 1887 both of these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> together with Bishop von Hefele of <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a> besought D&ouml;llinger to abandon his <a href="../cathen/11235b.htm">Old-Catholic</a> attitude and be reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His response to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> contained these words "Ought I (in obedience to your suggestion) to appear before the Eternal Judge, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> burdened with a double <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>?" At the end of his letter to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> he said: "I think that what I have written so far will suffice to make clear to you that with such convictions one may stand even on the threshold of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in a condition of inner peace and spiritual calm". He died aged ninety-one, still outside the communion of Church.


<h2>Life and writings</h2>

<p>It was at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> that D&ouml;llinger began his life-work. Formally, he was professor of canon law and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, but was soon burdened with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, a task to which a weaker or inferior mind would not have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> equal. He declined in 1829, a call to <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, although King Louis I heartily wished him out of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; he also refused a later call to Freiburg in the Breisgau. He was offered in 1839, a professorship at an English college, but preferred to remain in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. To facilitate the coming of Johann Adam M&ouml;hler from T&uuml;bingen to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> (1835), he gave over to him the courses of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, and when M&ouml;hler died (12 April, 1838) he collected a number of essays of this great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> which for the most part were already in print but were widely scattered, and published them on two volumes (1839) under the title "Gesammelte Schriften und Aufs&auml;tze". While M&ouml;hler taught at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, D&ouml;llinger lectured on the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> (<em>Historische Dogmatik</em>). At the request of Abel, Minister of the Interior, D&ouml;llinger began in 1838, a course of lectures in the Faculty of Philosophy on the philosophy of religion in opposition to the teaching of the honorary professor Von Baader, the <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophist</a>, and of Schelling. He continued, however, to lecture on <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. From November, 1846 to February, 1848 <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> public affairs were disturbed by the royal attachment to Lola Montez, a Spanish ballerina; the Abel ministry was dismissed, and professors <a href="../cathen/09010a.htm">Lasaulx</a>, Moy, Urtsr, Phillips, <a href="../cathen/07382a.htm">H&ouml;fler</a> and <a href="../cathen/04761c.htm">Deutinger</a> either dismissed or reprimanded; Doilinzer, finally as stated above, was removed from his office. After his restoration in 1860 he continued to the end as professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>. In 1862 he has made <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of the Order of Maximilian for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and art.

<p>Apart from the aforesaid officers of canon and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, D&ouml;llinger held but one other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. After the conflict concerning <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> (1832), he was made <em>defensor matrimonii</em> in the matrimonial court of first instance, later in that of second instance, which office he held until 1862. His circle of friends frorn the beginning quite extensive; the physicians and professors of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> who frequented his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house were themselves men of distinction. As a student he formed the acquaintance of the poet, Graf Voll Platen, and of Victor Aim&eacute; Huber. Later Platen wished to study Sanskrit with D&ouml;llinger, and visited him twice at Marktscheinfeld. In the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> he met Prince <a href="../cathen/07384c.htm">Alexanderk van Hohenlohe</a>, of whose <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures he said later: "Cures there were, but such as often happen in the history of the Church; the deep stirring of the emotions suffices easily enough to explain them", a remark that fails to account for the presence of deep emotions in the absent sick. On a visit to Platen at Erlangen, in 1822, he met Pfaff, Schubert, and Schelling, the last a friend of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. In his early days at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> he was much in the company of the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Franz von Baader. When in 1827, the famous Joseph G&ouml;rres came to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> as professor of history, there formed about him at once a sympathetic circle of scholars, among them the youthful D&ouml;llinger. D&ouml;llinger's relations with <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, more particularly with <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Count Montalembert</a>, gave occasion in 1832 to a violent attack in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Parliament on G&ouml;rres and his friends. <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> at that time contemplated the establishment at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> of a house of studies for young <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> (<em>Oeuvre des &eacute;tudes allemandes</em>), who might thus come under the influence of G&ouml;rres, Baader, and others, and on their return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> stand manfully for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the meantime D&ouml;llinger had met Andreas R&auml;ss, the founder (1821) of "Der Katholik" (still published at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>), who in 1828 was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> as well as professor of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and homiletics; with D&ouml;llinger he projected various literary enterprises which, through pressure of other work, were never realized.

<p>At this time <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Monsignor Wiseman</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, then professor at the Roman University (Sapienza) and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the English College, saw the necessity of strengthening <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the development of its new opportunities in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and for this reason was minded to effect closer relations with the learned <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. D&ouml;llinger seemed to him the proper mediator; he therefore visited <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> in 1835, made the acquaintance of the distinguished professor, and spoke with him of his hopes and plans. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, already well known in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by his "Horae Syriae" arouse in D&ouml;llinger so deep an interest, that the next year the latter visited <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His biographer, Friedrich, describes the result of this visit as follows: "D&ouml;llinger had a life-long <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for bureaucracy both in the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>; the large independence, therefore, of English public life delighted him and filled him with an admiration that was often excessive. Thenceforth he remained always in close touch with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, kept constantly in his home, and at considerable sacrifice, a number of young English students, and directed the studies of others whom he could not keep under his own roof". In 1850 the youthful Sir John Emerich Edward Acton entered his house as a student, to become later his intimate friend. Later, as John Lord Acton and Regius Professor of modern history at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> he remained in close touch with the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>, though he never formally severed his connection with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We do not as yet possess accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning Acton's share in the work known as "Letters from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" concerning the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (R&ouml;mische Briefe vom Konzil) published by D&ouml;llinger in the Augsburg "Allgemeine Zeitung".

<p>As a rule D&ouml;llinger observed with his pupils a strict academic dignity and reserve; among the few whom he treated as intimate friends Acton was easily the foremost. Among those who in this early period exerted the greatest influence over D&ouml;llinger was <a href="../cathen/08323a.htm">Karl Ernest Jarcke</a>, founder and editor (since 1832) of the Berlin "Politische Woehenblatter", confidant of <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a>, and a frequent visitor to the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> capital. In 1838 came the foundation of the "Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter" by Guido G&ouml;rres, Phillips, and <a href="../cathen/08323a.htm">Jarcke</a>; the new organ soon greatly augmented the influence of G&ouml;rres and his circle of friends, the most loyal and earnest of whom at this time was D&ouml;llinger.

<p>The dispute over the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, known as the <em>K&ouml;lner Streit</em> (1831), followed close upon that in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1831); both were fought out dramatically, and brought D&ouml;llinger and his <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> friends to the front as vigorous defenders of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The first estrangement of D&ouml;llinger from G&ouml;rres and his friends came about through the publication of an important manual of canon law by Philips (from 1834 to 1847 professor of canon law at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>). To D&ouml;llinger it seemed that the latter emphasized excessively the extent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative. Nevertheless, he continued for a decade to collaborate on the "Historisch-politische Blatter"; it was only slowly and almost imperceptibly that the change in his opinions came about. Gradually, owing to his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and particularly to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, he sought and found newer friends in Liberal circles. As member of the Frankfort Parliament (1848) he sat with the Right, among men like <a href="../cathen/12631c.htm">Radowitz</a>, Lichnowsky, Schwerin, Vincke, and others, he also belonged to the Club "Zum steinernen Haus".

<p>The change that had come about in D&ouml;llinger's views during the preceding years may best be measured by the fact that his colleagues in Frankfort obtained his consent to the following plan. <a href="../cathen/12631c.htm">General von Radowitz</a>, in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> deputies, was to make this declaration in Parliament: "The orders, including the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, are not a part of the living organism of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a> is no wise <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the German episcopate and the German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> do not need its help to fulfil their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>; German learning [<em>die deutsche Wissenoschaft</em>] needs no aid of this nature. The possible advantages for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> accruing from the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a> should be greatly outweighed by the disturbances and perils that its presence would create. If it were proposed to introduce the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> into any Geman State, moved the higher interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we would protest most decidedly againt the execution of any such plan".

<p>The relations of D&ouml;llinger with the German episcopate were frequent, particularly after the meeting of the German and Austrian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (22 Oct to 16 Nov., 1848). His report concerning the national church and <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a> as submitted to this important assembly, aroused deep interest, was received with approval in many episcopal circles, and assured him the leadership in the acute ecclesiastico-political discussions then impending. Between 1852 and 1854 he visited Northern and Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in 1857 <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Apart from his learned researches on these occasions, he profited by these journeys to: strengthen his existing relations with numerous <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, also to new acquaintances and friendships. While D&ouml;llinger sought in every way to retain the favour of King Maximilian II, the cleft between him and his former friends as well as his own past continued to widen. For a while the famous professor seemed to stand almost alone, particularly after the stormy scenes of the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> congress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> savants (28 sept. to 1 oct., 1863). Daniel Bonifatius von Haneberg, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Boniface in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, opened this Congress of eighty-four members mostly German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, on which occasion D&ouml;llinger delivered his famous discourse, "Die Vergangenheit und Gegervart der katholischen Theologie" (The Past and Present of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Theology). Many of those present, among them Haneberg, saw with sorrow that they could not follows D&ouml;llinger along the new path he was taking. He held no longer to the universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> as a world-religion; in its place, nourished by the court atmosphere he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> so well, arose a strictly nationalistic concept of the catholic Church. All <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> measures he henceforth criticized from the narrow angle of Gallicanism, and ridiculed in anonymous articles and other writings. He was daily in closer communion with the principal <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> statesmen, and amid these relations conceived an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> office which in the end could not be other than un-Catholic. It may be noted here that his intimacy with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Johann Huber, a disciple of Schelling, had attracted attention long before this. Nevertheless (and it was a sign of the strong tension of those days and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> temper of many) a number of German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> still held to D&ouml;llinger, although they had long since parted company with Joseph Hubert Reinkens, professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> and later first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>. It was not until 18 July, 1870, when the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> was proclaimed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that there was a sharp division in the ranks of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This compelled D&ouml;llinger henceforth to seek friends and allies exclusively among the leaders of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> and the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>, as also among anti-Catholic statesmen and princes.

<p>D&ouml;llinger, as is well known, wrote much and admirably, and his writings exhibit, with a rare fidelity, every phase of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> conflict. He was still a young man when his profound learning and brilliant diction, coupled with an unusal ease and rapidity in the critical treatment of whatever historical thesis lay before him, earned for him an international reputation. He lacked, however, the methodical training <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the scientific editing of original texts and documents, in which respect his deficiencies were occasionally only too evident. He was not content with bare investigation of the fact, and problems of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, or of medieval and modern but sought always a satisfactory solution for the difficulties that confronted the student. His diction was always charming whether the subject were one demanding strictly scientific and well-ordered narrative or the light and rapid style called for by the pressing, but ephemeral, needs of the hour. He was likewise skillful as a public speaker, not only when delivering a carefully prepared discourse but also when called on for an extemporaneous address. A typical example of his ability in this respect was his extempore discourse in St. Paul's Church, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, on <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, apropos of Article III of the fundamental articles (<em>Grundreche</em>) of the Constitution: several of the best speakers had preceded him, and, in order to closely follow their line of thought his whole address had to be extemporized; nevertheless, it was admitted by all that, both in form and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, his address was by far the best delivered on that occasion. The admiration of his students, no doubt, was due in great measure to the beautiful diction in which he was wont to dress the facts of history.

<p>The writings of D&ouml;llinger may be divided into purely scientific and political or ecclesiastico-political. They exhibit for the most part, however, a mutual interdependence and often complete one another. To avoid repetition it seems better to follow the chronological order. It is worthy of note that when writing anonymously his tone was frequently bitter, occasionally even violent, writing over his own name he usually avoided such extremes. His first work (1826) "Die Eucharistie in den drei ersten Jahrhunderten", has already been mentioned. ln 1828 he published the first volumes of Hortig's "Kirchengeschichte", from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to the end of the eighteenth century. He also wrote frequently at this time for "Eos", a new review founded by his friends, Baader and G&ouml;rres; most of the articles dealt with contemporary subjects. According to Friedrich he also prepared "Umrisse zu Dante's Paradies von P. von Cornelius", i.e. an introduction to that writer's edition of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Paradiso". His journalistic activity, however, was far from pleasing to the ministerial councillor, Joseph Freiherr von Hormayr, a somewhat erratic but influential, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who so influenced the king that he wished D&ouml;llinger well out of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, as has been seen in the case of his call to Breslau.

<p>In these years, also, he defended with vigour the matrimonial legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in connection with the "Mixed Marriages" conflict (1831) in the Upper House of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Parliament, and he was author of an anonymous work "Ueber die gemischten Ehen"; at the same time he suggested as a means of avoiding all conflict, that the <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> be separated from the religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Meanwhile he continued to collect the material for his scientific works. In 1833 and 1835 respectively he published the first and second parts of his "Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte" (to the end of seventh century). The next year (1836) he brought out the first volume, and in 1838 the first half of the second volume of his "Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte" (to the end of the fifteenth century). The essay "Muhammeds Religion, eine historische Betrachtung" was read before the Munich Academy about the time he published the aforesaid work on <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>; early in 1838 he published his "Beurtheilung der Darlegung des geheimen Rathes Bunsen: eine Stimme zum Frieden". A long controversy with Professor Thiersch followed this entrance of D&ouml;llinger into the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> conflict over <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> (<em>K&ouml;lner Streit</em>), his articles were printed in the Augsberg "Allgemeine zeitung" and are apparently his earliest contributions to the Journal which thirty-one years later he was to consummate his apostasy. Karl Von Abel, Minister of Interior, now asked him to publish a popular "Weltgeschichte" or universal history, from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> point of view, also a manual of religion (<em>Religionslehrbuch</em>) for the gymnasia or high-schools; he began these works but, feeling himself unsuited to their composition, persuaded the minister to relieve him from the undertaking. Later on he undertook to explain his failure in the Parliament, his explanation, however, seems quite improbable, and may be looked on as either a meaningless piece of malice or a case of self-deception.

<p>A royal order (1838) that compelled all soldiers to genuflect before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was soon the cause of much friction; in 1843 the matter came before the Upper House, where representatives of the non-Catholic soldiers protested against the measure as contrary to liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. D&ouml;llinger defended the king and the Government in an anonymous work entitled: "Die Frage der Kniebeugung der Protestanten von der religi&ouml;sen und staatsrechtlichen Seite erwogen", wherein he treated the question from both the religious and politics point of view; this was followed by a long controversy with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> deputy, Harless. In the meantime he was chosen by the University of Munich as its representative in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Parliament, where he protested against the admission of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and defended the emancipation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, both of which acts drew upon him the enmity of many. During this political agitation, and while Lola Montez still held the king infatuated, appeared the first volume of his great work "Die Reformation, ihre innere Entwicklung und ihre Wirkungen im Umfange des lutherischen Bekenntnisses", i.e. on the origin, development, and consequences of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> circles; the second volume appeared in 1847; the third in 1848. A second edition of the first volume was printed in 1851. This work unfortunately remained incomplete; Friedrich says that D&ouml;llinger's friends prevented him from publishing the corresponding three volumes, i.e. an account of the conditions within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the same period. This work long exercised a powerful influence and still remains its value. <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Johannes Janssen</a> was inspired by it to undertake the exhaustive studies which have done so much to destroy the traditional legends that so long did <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as a history of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>The foolish attempt of some zealots to have the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> proclaimed a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> (<em>Dogmatisierung des Kirchenstaates</em>) excited D&ouml;llinger to an extraordinary degree. He became firmly persuaded that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> could be saved only by the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. By <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> he meant chiefly historical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. All other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests seemed to this great scholar quite subordinate. His aversion to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, later quite pronounced, was another result of this <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude, the trend of which he revealed on various occasions at the Frankfort Parliament, and in the above-mentioned report (1848) of the Wurzburg meeting of the German and Austrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Gradually he came to be looked upon as a Gallican, nor was this because of his frequently expressed and strong dislike of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, among them the best and most loyal supporters of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, looked henceforth with a certain anxiety on the course of D&ouml;llinger. It could not be said that the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> admired him unreservedly. On the other hand, throughout the ranks of the German and Autrian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there was still only a mediocre <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the legacy of an earlier period of infidelity and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, and the concept of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and discipline differed widely from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ideal of both.

<p>To understand fully the profound changes working in the mind of D&ouml;llinger during the critical years from 1847 to 1852 it is well to recall his discourses at the general meetings of the "Katholischer Verein" at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1849) and Linz (1850), also those in the Upper House of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Parliament in St. Paul's at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and at the meetings of the German <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> at Wurzburg (1849) and Freising (1850). To some extent, also, disappointment was responsible for his new <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude; his friends and admirers had tried in vain to obtain for him an important German see. It is worthy of note also that about 1855 the author of the work on the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> began gradually to modify his views to such an extent that eventually (in 1889) he wrote a panegyric on <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.

<p>The Greek patristic text entitled "Philosophoumena, or Refutation of all Heresies", discovered in 1842 and edited by Miller (Oxford, 1851), at once fascinated D&ouml;llinger, and he devoted to its study all the rich powers of his erudition, critical skill, and insight. In 1853 he published the result of his labours in "Hippolytus und Kallistus, oder die romische Kirche in der ersten Halfte des dritten Jahrhunderts", etc, a study of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> from 200 to 250, in reply to the interpretations of the "Philosophoumena" published by Bunsen, Wordsworth, Baur, and Gieseler. Despite the contrary arguments of <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, D&ouml;llinger's opinion has prevailed, and it is now generally acknowledged that <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> is the author of the work in question. D&ouml;llinger's essay in the "Historisch-Politische Blatter" (1853) entitled "Betrachtungen uber die Frage der Kaiserkronung", considerations on the imperial <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, contributed not a little to deter <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> from crowning <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>. Concerning the definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception D&ouml;llinger exhibited a prejudiced mind and a rather superficial historical grasp of the question; the defects in his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> equipment were here most noticeable. Indeed, he was much less concerned with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself than with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who wished to proclaim it as a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It was also his first open protest against a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who was soon to proclaim that <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> which seemed to D&ouml;llinger an utterly intolerable <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, from his view-point of exaggerated esteem for historical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>.

<p>The year 1857 was marked by the appearance of his "Heidenthum und Judenthum, Vorhalle des Christenthums" (Heathenism and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, the Vestibule of Christianity), the first part of his long contemplated <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>, the second part followed in 1860 (2nd ed., 1868) as "Christenthum und Kirche in der Zeit der Grundlegung", dealing with the Apostolic period. The work, as he had planned, was never completed. Most of the abundant material he had collected for an exhaustive history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was afterwards utilized in an ephemeral journalistic way. The work itself he never undertook, and had he done so, it is possible that he would have come into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> much sooner than he did.

<p>In 1861 some of the principal ladies of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> requested him to deliver a series of public discourses on Temporal Power; to this he acceded with pleasure, and the discourses given in the Royal Odeum were followed with deep attention by crowded audiences. His utterances, however, were so imprudent and so clearly inspired by <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> that in the midst of one of them <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, Monsignor Chigi, arose with indignation and left the hall. The impression made by these discourses on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world was painful in the extreme. D&ouml;llinger himself was deeply troubled by the agitation aroused; to justify himself in some measure, also to strengthen his position, now seriously compromised in great haste and issued during the same year his "Kirche und Kirchen, Papstthum und Kirchenstaat". It seems incredible that the opinions and judgements one reads in this work are really D&ouml;llinger's own; the reader is haunted by suspicion that he has before him a remarkable mixture of Byzantinism and <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> academic circles of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the meantime deeply agitated by the discussions incident to the renaissance of Scholaticism (see <a href="../cathen/10746a.htm">NEO-SCHOLASTICISM</a>) in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and philosophy, and those over the merit of the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> as against the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of candidates to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. There were excesses on both sides that intensified the situation, whereupon it seemed to many that an academical congress would be a helpful measure. An Assembly of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars met in 1863 at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, before which, as already stated, D&ouml;llinger delivered (28 September) the discourse "Die Vergangenheit und Gegenwart der katholischen Theologie" (The Past and Present of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Theology). His views as expressed in this occasion, were calculated to irritate and embitter his opponents, and a reconciliation seemed further away than before. Shortly afterwards, in the thirteenth thesis of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Syllabus of 8 Dec., 1864 (see QUANTA CURA) certain opinions of D&ouml;llinger were condemned.

<p>It was unfortunate, but not surprising, therefore, that the "Papstfabeln des Mittelalters", <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> fables about the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (Munich, 1863; 2nd ed. 1890) received no impartial appreciation from his opponents; the pages (131-53) on the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a> of Pope Honorius were considered particularly offensive. From this period to the publication of the "Janus" letters, the pen of D&ouml;llinger produced mostly anonymous articles, in which his approaching apostasy was daily more clearly foreshadowed. He gave also much thought to the plan of a universal German biography, the "Allgemeine deutsche Biographie". Though it was finally von Rancke who induced the Munich Academy to undertake the now practically finished work which, unfortunately, still shows frequent traces of partisanship, it was D&ouml;llinger's ardour and insistence that first moved the Academy to consider the proposition. There is even yet a very widespread conviction, and it was believed by the great <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian archaeologist</a> <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, who was quite accurately informed on all the details of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, that D&ouml;llinger would scarcely have left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> if he had been invited to take an honorable share in the preliminary work for the council. Nor does this seem at all improbable to those who understand his character. It is, in any case, very regrettable that on this point the influence of <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Cardinal Reisach</a> should have outweighed that of <a href="../cathen/13595a.htm">Cardinal Schwarzenberg</a>, and availed to exclude the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> historian.

<p>Scarcely had the first detailed accounts of the council's proceedings appeared, when D&ouml;llinger published in the Ausburg "Allgemeine Zeitung" his famous "March articles", reprinted anonymously in August of that year under the title: "Janus, der Papst, und das Konzil". The accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> here manifested easily convinced most readers that only D&ouml;llinger could have written the work. At this time he provoked the "Hohenlohe theses" and followed them up with an anonymous work, "Erw&auml;gungen fur die Bisch&ouml;fe des Konzils uber die Frage der Unfehlbalkeit", considerations concerning <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the council. This work was translated into French, and a copy sent to every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/13595a.htm">Cardinal Schwarzenberg</a>, in unison with French sympathizers, urged him to be present at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in his private capacity during the council; he preferred, however, to remain at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, where he prepared for the aforesaid "Allgemeine Zeitung", with materials sent him regularly from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (even by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>), the well-known Roman correspondence (Briefe vom Knzil), each letter of which fell in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> like a bomb, but whose real author no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. When D&ouml;llinger wrote for the same journal, over his own name, the articles "Einige Worte uber die Unfehlbarkeitsaddresse der Konzilsmajoritat" (a few words on the address of the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>) and "Die neue Geseh&auml;ftsordnung im Konzil" (the council's new order of business), he was denounced in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop Ketteler</a> addressed to him an open letter quite brusque in tone, while other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> urged him to keep silent. D&ouml;llinger yielded, and on 18 July, 1780, the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">personal infallibility of the pope</a> and his universal pastoral office were declared <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>. The foregoing presentation of the actual situation in that critical time is taken from the life of D&ouml;llinger by Johann Friedrich, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of Cardinal Hohenlohe during the council and to whom, despite his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of silence concerning the affairs of the council, D&ouml;llinger was indebted for the materials of the "Letters". The declaration of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> meant naturally for D&ouml;llinger a severe internal conflict. The facts however do not justify the statement that he had long previously determined never to accept the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, however, insisted on a public declaration of his attitude, and D&ouml;llinger weakly yielded to the pressure of those who were bent on apostasy, and wrote to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 29 March, 1871, declaring his refusal to accept the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and stating his reasons in his character as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, historian, and citizen.

<p><a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> have both declared, with all due formality and solemnity, that <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> each within its own limits, are mutually independent; the D&ouml;llinger portrait of an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> domineering over the State is, therefore, a caricature. For the great scholar it was <em>dies ater</em> when he wrote these words, for the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> a period of profound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> confusion, for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> a succumbing to spiritual arrogance, for the citizen a full confession of the bureaucratic <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> of the State, a kind of belated resurrection of the memories of his youth.

<p>D&ouml;llinger had definitely severed connection with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Three weeks later (18 April, 1871) both D&ouml;llinger and Friedrick were publicly declared <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. The action of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, under the circumstances unavoidable, aroused much feeling; on the one side it was hailed as a decisive step that ended a situation grown <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> and intolerable, on the other many rejoiced that the world-renowned scholar had not bent his neck under the yoke of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This marked the rise of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>. At Pentecost of the same year (1871) a declaration was published, chiefly the work of D&ouml;llinger, setting forth the need of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. D&ouml;llinger also signed a petition to the Government asking for one of the churches of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Hitherto the opposition of this party to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been mostly of a philosophico-historical character, and the dominant statesmen of the time could turn it to little practical account. It was now the hour for a number of inimical canonists whose opportunity lay in the anti-Catholic tendencies of the governments of the period. Prince Bismarck's plan of a National German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as it was possible to make it (foreshadowed by D&ouml;llinger in 1849), corresponded now with the wishes of he <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> catholics, henceforth governed absolutely by the canonist von Schulte (see <a href="../cathen/11235b.htm">OLD CATHOLICS</a>). The first assembly of these opponents of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> was held at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 22-24 Sept. 1871. On the suggestion of von Schulte, and despite the opposition and warnings of D&ouml;llinger, it was decided to establish the "Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". Thenceforth D&ouml;llinger followed a policy of vacillation, avoiding on the one hand any formal relationship to the new Church, on the other helpful to it by counsel and deeds; at one time disapproving positively important decisions of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and again placing at its disposal all his influence and prestige. The new "Church" lacked distinction and was personally very distasteful to him; in public, however, though with measured reserve, he defended it. Henceforth formally <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he recognized the validity and legality of that act, at the same time he held it beneath his dignity to submit to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Bishop Reinkens, for whom the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> had obtained <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. He stood, therefore, between the two camps, and looked on it as almost a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> that the most insignificant members of the new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> considered him, more or less, an intimate adherent and sharer of their trials.

<p>The next seven years he spent in pacifying his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, or, in his own words in a process of internal criticism; until 1887 he did nothing of importance, apart from a few essays, his academic discourses, and the work "Ungedruckte Berichte und Tagebucher zur Geschichte des Konzils von Trient", unedited reports and diaries useful for a history of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1876). In 1887 he edited, with Reusch, the autobiography of <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> up to 13 June, 1613, in German; with Reusch also he published (1889-90) in two volumes "Geschichte der Moralstreitigkeiten in der romisch-katholischen Kirche seit dem sechszehnten Jahrhundert, mit Beitragen zur Geschichte und Carakteristik des Jesuitenordens", or a history of the moral-theological discussions in the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> since the sixteenth century, including studies on the history and characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>. About the same time he published in two volumes his "Beitrage zur Sektengeschichte des Mittelalters"; after his death appeared (1891) the third volume of is "Akademische Vortrage", or academic discourses.

<p>He retained to the end a remarkable physical and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> strength. Though his latest writings met with a kindly reception in scientific circles they were not considered as superior in merit, either from the view-point of scientific criticism or as historical narrative. Seldom has it been so clearly proven that whenever a man turns completely from a glorious and honourable past, however stormy, his fate is irrevocably sealed.
