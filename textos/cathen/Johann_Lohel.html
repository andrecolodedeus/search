<h1>Johann Lohel</h1>  

<p>(JOHANN LOHELIUS)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, b. at Eger, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, 1549; d. 2 Nov., 1622. Of poor parentage, he was piously brought up; at fifteen he was engaged as a domestic in the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of Tepl, but was allowed to follow the classes in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; he soon surpassed his fellow students, and in 1573 received the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> habit. After a two-years <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, Lohelius went to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Prague. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1576 and was recalled to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran heresy</a> having made inroads into <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, he gave a course of sermons at <a href="../cathen/14514a.htm">Tepl</a>, in which he gained the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and brought many back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>In 1579 he became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Mount Sion Abbey, at <a href="../cathen/14312a.htm">Strahov</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and he strove, with some success, to lift the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> out of the unfortunate state into which it had fallen; but Lohelius was soon called back to Tepl. However, he was in 1583 allowed to resume the office of <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Strahov.

<p>Lohelius was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Strahov in 1586. With him a new era of progress and prosperity dawned on the sorely tried Abbey of Strahov. The emperor and the magnates of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> generously assisted him in restoring the church and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> buildings; the abbot-general, John Despruets, named him his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and visitor of the circles of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In 1604 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>, as auxiliary to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. During the illness of Archbishop von Lamberg, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> created Lohelius coadjutor in May, 1612. At the death of von Lamberg on 18 Sept., 1612, Lohelius became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of Rudolph in 1609 had emboldened the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; having gained the upper hand in <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and expelled many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, regular and secular. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was altered to suit the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> worship; the altars were demolished, and the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> destroyed. Lohelius had taken refuge in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he remained until 1620. After the battle of the White Mountain, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his chapter, as well as the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and other religious, returned to Prague. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, cleansed and refurnished, was again <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 28 Feb., 1621. Lohelius died soon after, of a slow fever; he was buried in the church of Strahov.
