<h1>Johann Michael Haydn</h1>  

<p>A younger brother of <a href="../cathen/07158b.htm">Franz Joseph Haydn</a>; born at Rohrau, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 14 September, 1737; died at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, 10 August, 1806. In 1745, Michael Haydn entered the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Stephen, in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where his brother <a href="../cathen/07158b.htm">Joseph</a> had been active as soprano soloist since 1740. By the order of the choir-master, Johann Adam Karl Reuter, <a href="../cathen/07158b.htm">Joseph</a> was entrusted with the musical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his younger brother. They were together in the choir for three years. When <a href="../cathen/07158b.htm">Joseph's</a> soprano voice gave out, Michael succeeded him as soloist, remaining with St. Stephen's choir until 1755. In 1757 he was called to Grosswardein to serve Archbishop Sigismund as choir- master of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and in 1762 he accepted the position of orchestra conductor to the Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, later assuming also the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, which was presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. The latter he subsequently exchanged for similar <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Although Michael Haydn retained these honourable positions to the end of his days, i.e. for almost forty-four years, during the first years of his incumbency his services were not quite satisfactory to his employers, nor did they call forth the approval of his contemporaries, among whom were Leopold Mozart and his great son <a href="../cathen/10623a.htm">Wolfgang</a>. Neither his musical activities nor his personal conduct were edifying to those around him. But his wife, the court singer, Maria Magdalena Lipp, daughter of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir-master, was a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and austerity of life, and she seems to have wrought such a change in her husband that his <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothfulness</a> and inertia gave place to wonderful activity and industry.

<p>As was the custom among composers in his day, and by virtue also of his function as conductor and <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>, Haydn wrote in every form of composition, but by predilection on <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts. To the musical interpretation of these he undoubtedly devoted his best efforts. We can form an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of his great productivity (which, however, does not equal his brother's) when we consider that he wrote twenty-four masses, four so-called German masses (consisting of five or six numbers to be sung during low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>), two requiems, one hundred and fourteen graduals, sixty-seven offertories, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, vespers, cantatas, <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorios</a>, and several operas. Among his instrumental works are thirty symphonies, serenades, marches, minuets, string quartettes, and fifty preludes for the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>. Michael Haydn had an aversion to seeing his works in print, and most of his productions remained in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. His style might be called eclectic. His tendency was to unite the salient traits and characteristics of contemporary masters who wrote for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. While he gave to everything he wrote a certain personal stamp, his individuality and depth of conception were not sufficiently pronounced to preserve many of his works to posterity. Some of his <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> compositions are contained in B. Kothe's "Handbuch fur Organisten", and the same author's "Praludienbuch". Kothe's collection "Musica Sacra", Seiler's "Laudate Dominum" and "Sammlung leicht ausfuhrlicher Kirchenmusik", published by the Caecilienverein of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, contain some of his vocal works. A complete collection of the unpublished works of Michael Haydn is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Peter, at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>.
