<h1>Johann Michael Nathanael Feneberg</h1>  

<p>Born in Oberdorf, Allgau, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 9 Feb., 1751; died 12 Oct., 1812. He studied at Kaufbeuren and in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> gymnasium at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and in 1770 entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, at Landsberg, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was suppressed in 1773, he left the town, but continued his studies, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1775 and appointed professor in the gymnasium of St. Paul at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. From 1778-85 he held a modest <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at Oberdorf and taught a private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, in 1785 he was appointed professor of rhetoric and poetry at the gymnasium of Dillingen, but was removed in 1793, together with several other professors suspected of leanings towards Illuminism. A plan of studies drawn up by him for the gymnasium brought him many enemies also. He was next given the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Seeg comprising some two thousand five hundred and received as assistants the celebrated author Christoph Schmid, and X. Bayer. He was a model <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in every respect. Within a short time he executed a chart of the eighty-five villages in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and took a census of the entire district.

<p>In the first year of his pastoral service he sustained severe injuries by a fall from his horse, which necessitated the amputation of one leg just below the knee. He bore the operation without an anesthetic, and consoled himself for the loss of the limb by saying: <em>Non pedibus, sed corde diligimus Deum</em> (We <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not with our feet but with our hearts). Shortly after, his relations with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Martin Boos led him to be suspected of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Boos had created such a sensation by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> that he was compelled to flee for safety. He took at Seeg with Feneberg, who was a relation and assisted him in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> for nearly a year. In the meantime he strove to convert or "awaken" Feneberg life, the life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. Boos's followers were called the Erweckten Br&uuml;der (Awakened Brethren). Among these brethren, many of whom were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Feneberg was called Nathanael and his two assistants Markus and Silas.

<p>Boos's preaching and conduct at Seeg was reported to the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and Feneberg, with his assistants, Bayer and Siller, were also involved. In February, 1797, an episcopal commissioner arrived in Seeg, and in Feneberg's absence seized all his papers, private correspondence and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and carried them to Augsburg. Feneberg, with his assistants, appeared before an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in August, 1797; they were required to subscribe to the condemnation of ten <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> propositions and then permitted to return to their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. They all protested that they had never held any of the propositions in the sense implied. It does not appear that Feneberg was subsequently molested in this connection, nor did he ever fail to show due respect and obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. In 1805 he resigned the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Seeg and accepted that of Vohringen, which was smaller but returned slightly better revenues. This appointment and the assistance of generous friends enabled him to pay the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> he had incurred on account of his trouble and the political disturbances of the time. For a month before his death he suffered great bodily pain but he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> unceasingly, and devoutedly receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> expired.

<p>He remained friendly to Boos even after the latter's condemnation, and regretted that his friend, Bishop Sailer, was not more sympathetic to <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Feneberg was a man of singular <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, candour, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> but failed to see the dangers lurking in Boos pietism. Numbers of the disciples of Boos--as many as four hundred at one time--became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, although he himself remained nominally in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Feneberg is the author of a translation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which was published by <a href="../cathen/15679a.htm">Bishop Wittmann</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>.
