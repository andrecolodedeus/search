<h1>Johann Michael Sailer</h1>  

<p>Professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, b. at Aresing in Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> 17 October, 1751; d. 20 May, 1832, at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Sailer was the son of a poor shoemaker. Until his tenth year he attended the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in his native place; after this he was a pupil in the <em>gymnasium</em> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. In 1770 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Landsberg in Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>; upon the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> in 1773 he continued his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. In 1775 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; 1777-80 he was a tutor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and from 1780 second professor of dogmatics at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. Along with many others, he lost his position in 1781 when the Elector Charles Theodore transferred <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In the years 1781-84 while engaged in literary work he attracted the attention of the elector and Bishop Clement Wenceslaus. In 1794 the latter called Sailer to Dillingen as professor of pastoral theology and ethics, a position which Sailer held for ten years and which brought him a high reputation. His opponents, professors of Dillingen and Rossle, the principal of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Pfaffenhausen, succeeded in limiting Sailer's activities in 1793 and in securing his sudden dismissal in 1794. Sailer now went to visit his friend Winkelhofer at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and pursued there by his opponents, went to the house of his friend Beck at Ebersberg. Here he devoted himself to literary work until, in 1799, he was called to a professorship at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. In 1800 he was transferred along with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to Landshut. Here he taught pastoral and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, pedagogics, homiletics, liturgy, and catechetics; celebrated as a teacher and a writer he was repeatedly called to other positions, was on terms of friendship with distinguished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and was universally revered by his pupils, among whom was the Crown Prince Louis, later King of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In 1818 Sailer declined the offer of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government to have him appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; in 1819 the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government, through the influence of the Crown Prince Louis, nominated him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was rejected by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1821, however, after he had sufficiently justified himself, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canon of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, in 1822 <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> and coadjutor with right of succession, in 1825 <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, and in 1829 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>.

<p>The age in which Sailer lived was dominated by the "Enlightenment", which in its radical form disputed the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and was characterized by externalism, contempt for <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">Christian mysticism</a>, worldliness of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, degradation of the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> by the treatment of secular topics, relaxation of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, denial of the primacy of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, efforts of the State to gain control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, turbulent reforms within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a one-sided training of the mind in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In opposition to these destructive tendencies Sailer came to the defense of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in the fundamental principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, striving for an inner, living, practical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that should manifest itself in charity, for the maintenance of godliness (<a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">Christian mysticism</a>), and for the training of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and intelligent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He also insisted that the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> should be reserved solely for the preaching of the Gospel, and that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be in union with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; he upheld the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and defended the freedom and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of the State. Ecclesiastical reform he ardently desired, not, however, through unauthorized agencies but by the appointed organs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and he demanded that <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> should aim at training both mind and will. Sailer labored for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal by his winning <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, by his utterances as teacher, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and preacher, and by his numerous works that were <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, devotional, and biographical in character.

<p>Thus Sailer brought back large numbers of people to Chrlstianity and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Notwithstanding his fruitful activity and his benevolence, Sailer had antagonists who opposed him partly from jealousy, partly from misunderstanding and ill-will; he was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>, indifferentism, and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. If Sailer is judged in connection with his times, these reproaches are without foundation. In his day Sailer was a pillar of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A perfectly correct judgment of Sailer has been expressed by Goyau in "L'Allemagne religieuse" (Paris, 1905): "With Sailer German <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, both <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, learned again to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. This is the peculiar characteristic of his activity. Do not expect from him any religious polemics; he abhorred them; what he really cherished was the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a sort of co&ouml;peration of the various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies against the negations of infidelity. Sailer made a breach in <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, by opposing to it a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in which both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies could unite" (pp. 294, 295). The best edition of his works is "J.M. Sailers samtliche Werke unter Anleitung des Verfassers", ed. <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Joseph Widmer</a>, 40 vols., Sulzbach, 1830-41; supplementary volume, 1845.
