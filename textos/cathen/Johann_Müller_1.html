<h1>Johann M&uuml;ller</h1>  

<p>(Regiomontanus).

<p>German <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, b. in or near K&ouml;nigsberg, a small town in lower Franconia (Dukedom of Coburg), 6 June, 1436; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 July, 1476. The name of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> agreed with the trade of the father who operated a mill. Regiomontanus signed himself Johannes de Monteregio, while in foreign countries he was known as Joannes Germanus or Francus. His <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> were published under various names, like Meister Hans von Kungsberg. About the age of twelve he was sent to Leipzig to study dialectics. In the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> matriculations (published by Erler, 1895) his name is not registered. Hearing of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> Peurbach (George of Peurbach in Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 1423-61), M&uuml;ller left <a href="../cathen/09140a.htm">Leipzig</a> for <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he was matriculated in 1450 as Johannes Molitoris de Kunigsperg. In 1452 he received the baccalaureate and in 1457 the title <em>Magister</em>. Lectures of his at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> are recorded as follows: in 1458 on perspective, in 1460 on Euclid, in 1461 on Virgil's Bucolics. His master and friend Peurbach showed him how incorrect were the Alphonsine Tables and how <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> the Latin translations of the Greek astronomers from intermediate Arabic translations. Together they observed the planet Mars two degrees off the place assigned to it and a lunar eclipse over an hour late on the Tables. A new field opened to the two astronomers with the arrival in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of the Greek scholar <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> of <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the emperor, and his brother Sigismund, for the purpose of adjusting differences and uniting them against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Having changed to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> mastered the Latin language like his own, and commenced translating Ptolemy directly from the Greek. On the other hand Peurbach was engaged in composing an epitome on Ptolemy's "Almagest". The double circumstance that neither of them was able to accomplish his task, the one for want of time, the other for not knowing Greek, brought about an agreement that Peurbach should accompany <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> together with Regiomontanus. Peurbach died 8 April, 1461, not yet thirty-eight years old, and left the "Epitome" to his pupil to be finished and published as a sacred legacy.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In company with his new patron, M&uuml;ller reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Fall of 1461. Under <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a> and other teachers he acquired so much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek that he understood all of the obscure points of the "Epitome" of his late master. During his stay in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> M&uuml;ller continually observed the sun, the moon, and the planets, and searched the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> for Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. He found another lunar eclipse over an hour in advance of the Tables. What <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> he could not acquire he had copied. A new Testament, written in Greek by his own hands, was his companion. The summer of 1462 was spent at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, and when <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> left for Greece in the Fall of the same year, M&uuml;ller accompanied him as far as <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. On the recommendation of his patron, M&uuml;ller was well received in various Italian cities. In <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> he became acquainted with an old friend of Peurbach, Bianchini, then ninety years of age, with <a href="../cathen/14573b.htm">Theodore of Gaza</a>, and with Guarini. He profited so well in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek that he understood the whole of Ptolemy, and was able to complete the "Epitome" of Peurbach by adding seven books to the six already written by his master. In Padua he was at once enrolled among the Academicians and was invited to lecture. While awaiting the return of his patron in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he discovered a portion of the Greek Arithmetic of Diophantus, continued his observations, refuted the quadrature of the circle given by Cuse, and computed a calendar with the places of sun and moon, the eclipses and the dates of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> for the next thirty years. After two years' absence from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, M&uuml;ller returned there alone in October, 1464, to spend four more years in studying and copying. His rich collection of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> comprised at that time <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion's</a> own copy of the Greek "Almagest". M&uuml;ller was now able to point out grave <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in the commentaries on Ptolemy and Theon by <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a>. The consequent enmity of the latter, and the absence of his patron, may have induced him to leave <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1468.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> registers in <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">Vienna</a> contain no record of M&uuml;ller ever resuming his lectures after his return. The next three years, or part of them, he seems to have spent in Buda, being recommended by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> to <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias Corvinus</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> as custodian of the libary, so rich in spoils from <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> and Constantinople. The ensuing <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the king in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> led M&uuml;ller to look for a place where he could carry out his life's plan: the determination of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> constants by observation and the publication of the literary treasures in print. N&uuml;remberg, then the centre of industry and commerce in southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, was his choice, and in the Fall of 1471 he was admitted to the city and even invited to lecture. A wealthy citizen, Bernhard Walther, furnished the means for an instrument shop, an observatory, and a printing office and joined M&uuml;ller in the work. The fruits soon appeared. The latitude of the place (49&#176; 24') and the obliquity of the ecliptic (23&#176; 28') were determined free from the effects of refraction; the planet Venus was made the link between the fixed stars and the sun, instead of the moon; the great comet of 1472 was observed during January and February in such a way that its orbit could be calculated. Halley writes: "This comet is the very first of which any proper observations have been handed down to us" (Phil. Trans. XXIV, 1706, p. 1883). The earlier observations of the comet of 1450 by <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Toscanelli</a>, were unknown to Halley, although the comet happened to be the one that bears his name. The printing office of Walther, with the improved methods and types of M&uuml;ller, turned out Peurbach's New Theory of the Comets and an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> poem of Manilius (1472-73); then M&uuml;ller's own "Calendarium Novum" and his <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> "Ephemerides" (1473-74) with the positions of the sun, moon, and planets, and the eclipses from 1475 to 1500. The latter guided <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> to America and enabled him to predict the lunar eclipse of 29 February, 1504.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;M&uuml;ller's scientific activity in N&uuml;remberg was brought to a close by a letter of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> calling him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the purpose of finally settling the reform of the calendar. <a href="../cathen/06391b.htm">Gassendi</a> relates, on the authority of Peter Ramus (1515-72) and of Paul Jovius (Giovio; 1483-1552), both <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, that M&uuml;ller was created <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Jovius writes in his "Eulogies appended to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pictures of celebrated men" in the museum of <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a> (p. 75): "Ab hac commendatione eruditi nominis creatus est a Xysto Quarto Ratisponensis Episcopus" etc. This testimony of a man contemporary of Regiomontanus is not improbable, since by this dignitary title the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could give more force to his invitation. Yet it seems <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that M&uuml;ller never occupied the episcopal chair. Whether a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> command was needed, or whether the world's problem of adjusting the calendar had in itself sufficient attraction, M&uuml;ller was again in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> towards the end of 1475. Death overtook him in less than a year at the age of forty, and the Panth&eacute;on is said to be his resting-place, although his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is unknown. The cause of his death was, according to Jovius, a pestilence then raging in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but according to Ramus, poison administered to him by the sons of his enemy, <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a>. The historical exactness of Ramus, however, is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> from his poetical stories of the iron fly and the wooden eagle, said to have been constructed in the laboratories of N&uuml;remberg. In consequence of the untimely death of M&uuml;ller, many of his works and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were lost, in particular everything on the reform of the calendar. Some works were published posthumously, like the five books on triangles and the quadrature of the circle (N&uuml;remberg, 1533); his trigonometry (1541); the "Scripta Cl. Math. fo. Regiomontani" (1544); the "Epitome" on Ptolemy's Almagest (Venice, 1496); and part of his correspondence with <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, Roder, Bianchini, and other scientists. The principal works are reviewed by <a href="../cathen/06391b.htm">Gassendi</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> books are described by Delambre; and the mathematical treatises are discussed by Cantor. Bibliographies on Regiomontanus are enumerated by Stern and Ziegler. A <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of M&uuml;ller was erected in the market-place of K&ouml;nigsberg in 1873.
