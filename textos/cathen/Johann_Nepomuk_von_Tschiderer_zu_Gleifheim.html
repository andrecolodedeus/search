<h1>Johann Nepomuk von Tschiderer zu Gleifheim</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, b. at Bozen, 15 Feb., 1777; d. at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, 3 Dec., 1860. He sprang from a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> that had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from the Grisons to the Tyrol in 1529 and to which the Emperor Ferdinand III had given a patent of nobility in 1620. Johann Nepomuk was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 27 July, 1800, by Emmanuel Count von Thun, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. After spending two years as an assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he went for further training to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was appointed notary Apostolic. After his return he took up pastoral work again in the German part of the <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Diocese of Trent</a>, and was later professor of moral and pastoral theology at the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. In 1810 he became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Sarnthal, and in 1819 at Meran. Wherever he went he gained a lasting reputation by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and charitableness. In 1826 Prince-Bishop Luschin appointed him <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canon and pro-vicar at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>; in 1832 <a href="../cathen/06371b.htm">Prince-Bishop Galura</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> selected him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Heliopolis and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> for Vorarlberg. In 1834 the Emperor Francis I nominated him Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and on 5 May, 1835, he entered upon his office. During the twenty-five years of his administration he was distinguished for the exercise of virtue and charity, and for intense <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his episcopal office. He was exceedingly simple and abstinent in his personal habits. On the other hand he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> splendour when it concerned the decoration of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the procuring of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vestments, and the ornamentation of the churches. He devoted a considerable part of his revenues to the building of churches, and to the purchase of good books for the parsonages and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains'</a> houses. His charity to the poor and sick was carried so far that he was often left without a penny, because he had given away everything he had. Twice the cholera raged in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and on these occasions he set his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a shining example of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">Christian courage</a>. He left his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the institution for the deaf and dumb at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for students that he had founded, and that was named after him the Joanneum. Directly after his death he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint; the process for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is now in progress.
