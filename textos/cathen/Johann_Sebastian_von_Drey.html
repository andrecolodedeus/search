<h1>Johann Sebastian von Drey</h1>  

<p>A professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>, born 16 Oct., 1777, at Killingen, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of R&ouml;hlingen, in the then <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principality of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>; died 19 Feb., 1853. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of R&ouml;hlingen, an ex-Jesuit, noting the boy's talents, instructed him in the elements of Latin, and persuaded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to send him, in 1787, in spite of their extreme poverty, to the gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>. There he lived partly on the charity of the townspeople and partly by tutoring, especially in Latin, mathematics, and physics. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 1797-1799, at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>; after 1799 he lived in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Pfaffenhausen and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the summer of 1801. During his five years as assistant in his native place, Drey studied the then paramount philosophy of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, Fichte, and Schelling, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> erudition which he acquired in this study appears clearly in his scientific works. His position, from 1806, as professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of religion, mathematics, and physics in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> academy of Rottweil, formed a good preparation for his subsequent academical career. When in 1812 King Frederick I of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> founded the University of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> national <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for his recently acquired <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> territory, Drey was called to lecture there on dogmatics, history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, and introduction to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. There he published two Latin dissertations: "Observata qu&aelig;dam ad illustrandam Justini M. de regno millenario sententiam" (1814), and "Dissertatio historico-theologica originem et vicissitudinem exomologeseos in ecclesi&acirc;. catholic&acirc; ex documentis ecclesiasticis illustrans" (1815), the latter of which was denounced to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but without serious consequences for its author, at least for the time being.

<p>When King William I (1817) incorporated the University of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> with the old national <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a> as its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Drey with his colleagues, Gratz and <a href="../cathen/07251a.htm">Herbst</a>, joined the staff of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and founded (1819), together with them and his new colleague, Hirscher, the "Theologische Quartalschrift" of T&uuml;bingen, still flourishing; he took a prominent part in its publication and wrote for it a number of essays and reviews. In the same year he published: "Kurze Einleitung in das Studium der Theologie mit R&uuml;cksicht auf den wissenschaftlichen Standpunkt und das katholische System". An effort to make Drey first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Diocese of Rottenburg</a> failed, among other reasons because of the distrust with which he was regarded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> owing to his above-named work on confession. Somewhat as a recompense the first position at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was reserved for him, which however, he never filled. In 1832 appeared his "Neue Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die Konstitutionen und Kanones der Apostel", a work of such thoroughness that only recent investigations, especially those of <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">von Funk</a>, have gone beyond it. After convalescing from a severe illness, be was relieved from his office as teacher of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> (1838). Just then his principal work, in three volumes, appeared: "Die Apologetik als wissenschaftliche Nachweisung der G&ouml;ttlichkeit des Christentums in seiner Erscheinung" (1838-1847). Still comparatively robust, though well advanced in years, Drey was pensioned in 1846, almost against his will; he continued, however, to write for <a href="../cathen/15607b.htm">Wetzer</a> and <a href="../cathen/15587a.htm">Welte's</a> "Kirchenlexikon" and for the "Theologische Quartalschrift" of T&uuml;bingen. With M&ouml;hler, Drey was the founder of the so-called <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> School of T&uuml;bingen. Like M&ouml;hler, Hefele, and <a href="../cathen/06322c.htm">von Funk</a>, he was a truly critical historian. But Drey also gave to the systematic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> its peculiar stamp, equi-distinct from <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, recognizing on the one hand the objective facts in the history of Revelation and the tradition from generation to generation, maintaining on the other the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of our natural reason and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation, with all due loyalty to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a> and Schanz faithfully followed in the path marked out by Drey.
