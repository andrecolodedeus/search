<h1>Johann Tetzel</h1>  

<p>First public antagonist of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, b. at Pirna in <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, 1465; d. at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 11 Aug., 1519. He began his studies at Leipzig during the semester of 1482-83; was promoted to the baccalaureate in 1487, being the sixth in a class of fifty-six. Not long after he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, whether at Pirna or Leipzig, cannot be established. Disaffection and friction having arisen in the Leipzig community, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1497 to secure permission from Joachim Turrianus, the general of the order, to enter another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In spite of a recall of this permission, he seems to have carried his point. A few years later we find him as <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Glogau, which belonged to the Polish province. At the request of the Polish provincial John Advocati, he was appointed inquisitor for <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> by the master-general, Cajetan. At this time he also received permission to take the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> steps to have himself promoted to the doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His relations with the Leipzig <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> must in the meantime have been friendly again, for not only do we find him preaching a number of times in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, but after severing his relations with the Polish province he was appointed inquisitor of the Saxon province. The activity of his life and publicity of his office made him a well-known figure. In 1503 he made his first appearance as a preacher of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> of Knights in Livonia obtained permission from <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> to have a jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for three years preached in the ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and Riga. After the lapse of three years <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> (22 Nov., 1506) granted a new <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for three additional years in the provinces of Cologne, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. At the end of 1509 he was <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> commissary at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and from here in 1510 he went to <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>.

<p>From July, 1510, to April, 1516, all traces of him were lost. It was his appearance as an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> preacher in 1516, to aid the construction of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">M<font size=-2>ARTIN</font> L<font size=-2>UTHER</font></a>), that thrust him into an undue prominence, invested him with an exaggerated importance, and branded him with an unmerited odium that only the most painstaking critical research is now slowly lifting. It was while preaching at J&uuml;terbog, a small town outside of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, not far from <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> (where the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were not allowed to be preached), that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in one of his most violent philippics in 1541 relates "many people at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> flocked after <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to J&uuml;terbog" (Wider Hans Worst in "Sammtl. W.", XXVI, 50-53), and then after much hesitation nailed the ninety-five theses on <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> on the castle church door at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 31 October, 1517. That this preaching of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> was not the primary and immediate cause that precipitated the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> ninety-five theses may be inferred not only from his subsequent course but also from the fact that the "Annales" of J&uuml;terbog (Hechtius, "Vita Joannis Tezelii", <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 1717, 53 sq.) prove that Tetzel preached there as early as 10 April; that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in his letter to Archbishop Albrecht (October 31, 1517) admits that he entertained the thought for a long time to preach against <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> abuses (Enders, "Dr. Martin Luther's Brief wechsel", I, Frankfort, 1884, 115); that Tetzel for several weeks had already been in the district of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a> (Paulus, "Johann Tetzel", Mainz, 1899, 47).

<p>The theses dispute between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and Tetzel, is handled so circumstantially in the article <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">M<font size=-2>ARTIN</font> L<font size=-2>UTHER</font></a> that we need not repeat it here. The publication of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> "Sermon on Indulgences and Grace" was replied to by Tetzel's "Vorlegung", issued in April, 1518 (Lea, in "A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences", III, 395, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> makes it <em>Vorlesung</em>), in which the scholastically-trained theologican, though not profound, scents nevertheless with keen penetration, not a mere academic tournament, but a far-reaching and momentous battle of principles, involving the very fundamentals of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> and the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He lays bare with extraordinary precision the unfortunate consequences that would arise. At the close of his "Vorlegung", Tetzel announces that he would presently publish "a few other principles and positions". These are the second series of theses, fifty in number, with Tetzel as author, and published in May, 1518. In these, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are but lightly touched upon, the burden of the argumentation being shifted to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Tetzel as yet was only a bachelor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In the course of 1518 he was promoted to the doctorate, whether by the master-general or the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> is not known. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> agitation having frustrated further efforts to popularize the granted <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of eight years, Tetzel, deserted by the public, broken in spirit, wrecked in health, retired to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Leipzig in 1518. Here in the middle of January, 1519, he had to face the bitter reproaches and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> incriminations of Carl von Meltitz. It was at this time that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> magnanimously penned a letter in which he tries to console him by declaring "that the agitation was not that of his [Tetzel's] creation, but that the child had an entirely different father". Tetzel died soon after, received an honourable burial, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church at Leipzig.



<p>History presents few characters that have suffered more senseless misrepresentation, even bald caricature, than Tetzel. "Even while he lived stories which contained an element of legend gathered around his name, until at last, in the minds of the uncritical <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians, he became the typical indulgence-monger, upon whom any well-worn anecdote might be fathered" (Beard, "Martin Luther", London, 1889, 210). For a critical scholarly study which shows him in a proper perspective, he had to wait the researches of our own time, mainly at the hands of Dr. Nicholas Paulus, who is closely followed in this article. In the first place, his teaching regarding the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the living was correct. The charge that the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was sold for money regardless of contrition or that <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be committed in the future could be purchased is baseless. An <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, he writes, can be applied only "to the pains of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which are confessed and for which there is contrition". "No one", he furthermore adds, "secures an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> unless he have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> contrition". The confessional letters (<em>confessionalia</em>) could of course be obtained for a mere pecuniary consideration without demanding contrition. But such document did not secure an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. It was simply a permit to select a proper confessor, who only after a contrite confession would absolve from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and reserved cases, and who possessed at the same time facilities to impart the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> (Paulus, "Johann Tetzel", 103).

<p>As much cannot be said about his teaching regarding <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the dead. The couplet attributed to him &#151; <blockquote> As soon as the gold in the casket rings <br>The rescued <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> springs, </blockquote>

<p>like that attributed to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <blockquote> Who loves not wine and wife and song <br>Remains a fool his life long; </blockquote>

<p>though verbally spurious, can in both instances be in substance unfailingly traced to the writings of their respective authors. By Tetzel they are substantially acknowledged in his Frankfort theses. Here he accepted the mere <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> opinion of a few obscure writers, which overstepped the contents of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> indulgence <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. This opinion found no recognition but actual condemnation at the hands of authoritative writers, and was rejected in explicit terms by <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a> as late as 1517-19. By the teaching he laid himself open to just censure and reproach. To condition a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for the dead on the mere gift of money, without contrition on the part of the giver, was as repugnant to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as it violated every principle of elementary <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. "Preachers act in the name of the Church", writes <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>, "so long as they teach the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but if they teach, guided by their own minds and arbitrariness of will, things of which they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, they cannot pass as representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; it need not be wondered at that they go astray" (Paulus, "Johann Tetzel", 165). It was this deviation from the correct teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the obtrusive and disgraceful injection of the treasury chest, that led to abuses and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> reprobated by such contemporaries as Cochl&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Emser</a>, and Duke George (Paulus, op. cit., 117-18). "Grave abuses arose; the attitude of the preachers, the manner of offering and publishing the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> aroused many <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>; above all, Tetzel is in no way to be exonerated" (Janssen-Pastor, "Geschichte des deutsch. Volkes", 18th ed., Freiburg, II, 84).

<p>If Tetzel was guilty of unwarranted <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views, if his advocacy of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> was culpably imprudent, his moral character, the butt of every senseless burlesque and foul <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a>, has been vindicated to the extent of leaving it untainted by any grave moral dereliction. These would hardly be worth alluding to, did not some of them have <a href="../cathen/10318b.htm">Miltitz</a> as the source. But <a href="../cathen/10318b.htm">Miltitz</a> has been so discredited that he no longer carries historical weight. "All efforts", writes Oscar Michael, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, "to produce <a href="../cathen/10318b.htm">Miltitz</a> as a reliable witness will prove futile" (M&uuml;nch. Allg. Zeit., 18 April, 1901). "The circulated reports of Miltitz about Tetzel deserve in themselves no credence", writes another <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> author (ibid., 14 March, 1910).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> charge, with its penalty of drowning, detailed by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, Malthesius, Sleidan and almost every <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> historian, has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so preposterous, that Brieger (Theodor) claims "it is high time . . . . that it vanish from all history" (Theol. Literaturzeit., 1900, 84). Dibelius of <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> says: "Among the faults and shortcomings ascribed to Tetzel by his enemies, that of immorality cannot stand" (Lecture on "Tetzel's Leben u. Lehre" in "Dresdner Journal", 20 March, 1903). "Paulus", in the words of Berger (A.), "has so effectually refuted the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> anecdote, that no one will ever revive it" (Histor. Viertelsjahrschr. f. Gesch., 1902, p. 256). The charge made by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in his seventy-fifth thesis, that Tetzel had preached impiously concerning the Blessed Virgin, and repeated in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> letter to Archbishop Albrecht (Enders, I, 115) and in most explicit terms in his pamphlet "Wider Hans Worst", was not only promptly and indignantly denied by Tetzel (13 Dec., 1518), declared <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by official resolution of the entire city magistracy of Halle (12 Dec., 1517), where it was claimed the utterance was made, but has now been successfully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a clumsy fabrication (Paulus, op. cit., 56-61).

<p>The charge of embezzling the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> funds is also legendary. The precautions adopted to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were of a character that precluded all chance of misappropriation. The chest to receive the money always had two or three locks, the keys of which were in the custody of different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, including a representative of the banking-house of Fugger. It could never be opened save in the presence of a notary. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> injunction was that the faithful had to deposit their contributions in person. To give it to the confessor or <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> subcommissary invalidated the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> (Paulus, op. cit., 76-77). The Tetzel <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> chests exhibited at J&uuml;terbog and other German towns, are counterfeits, according to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writer K&ouml;rner (Tetzel's Leben, 73). The latest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> biographer of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, Grisar, writes: "To ascribe to the unhappy <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> the 'cause' of the entire apostasy that set in since 1517 . . . is an <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> legend" ("Luther", Freiburg, 1911, I, 281).
