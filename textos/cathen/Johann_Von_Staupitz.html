<h1>Johann Von Staupitz</h1>  

<p>Abbot, born at Motterwitz near Leisnig (or Moderwitz near Meustadt an der Orla) about 1460; died at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, 28 Dec., 1524. He was descended from an ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Saxony, studied at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, and was matriculated in 1485. He later joined the Augustinian Order, probably at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and in 1497 moved to T&uuml;bingen, where in 1498 he became prior and in 1500 Doctor of Theology. He was subsequently prior at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and in 1503 was elected <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the German Congregation of Augustinians and summoned as professor to the new <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">University of Wittenberg</a>, in which he was the first dean of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. In 1512 he resigned his professorship, and moved to South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he thenceforth resided (at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, and Salzburg), except for some journeys to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. He resigned the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1520, received a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to join the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> in 1522, and finally became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's, Salzburg. On a tour of visitation he had become acquainted with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Erfurt, and had consoled the emaciated brother, who was torturing himself with his sinfulness, by speaking to him of the sin-remitting <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> and man's <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> in the Blood of Christ. For this <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> remained always grateful. In 1518 he was deputed by the promagister of the order to remonstrate with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> remained obstinate and through Staupitz sent an explanation of his theses on <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This circumstance has led some to include Staupitz among <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> followers. In reality his attitude was hesitating &#151; being partly suspicious and anxious, and partly encouraging and confirmatory &#151; because he still believed that it was only a question of a protest against <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses. By releasing <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> from obedience to the order, he separated its fate from that of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, but also gave the latter freedom of action. In 1520 revocation and <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> were demanded of Staupitz; he hesitated at first, because there was no need to revoke what he had never asserted, but finally declared that he recognized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as his judge. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> saw in this declaration a defection. However, Staupitz was no <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> but thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (especially as regards the freedom of the will, the meritoriousness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, and justification). This has been established by Paulus from the writings of Staupitz.
