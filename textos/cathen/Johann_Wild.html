<h1>Johann Wild</h1>  

<p>Scriptural commentator and preacher, better known by his Latin name FERUS, b. in Swabia, 1497; d. at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 8 Sept., 1554. At an early age he joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Cologne. His application and proficiency to study were very distinguished, and laid the foundation of that extensive acquaintance with <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the Fathers at which he afterwards excelled. At a chapter held in the Convent at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> in 1528, he was appointed professor of rhetoric and belles-lettres, scriptor, and preacher. His sermons in the churches of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> soon gained a high reputation for learning and eloquence. Subsequently at a chapter celebrated in the Convent at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1540, he was elected definitor of the province and appointed to the arduous post of <em>Domprediger</em> (preacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>), which he continued to occupy till his death. By his unflagging <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy he preserved his order and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>; and it was principally due to his preaching that <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> remained steadfast in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Not even his enemies disputed his title of being the most learned preacher in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the sixteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian, Henry Pantaleon, said of him: "His days and nights were spent in the fulfillment of his sacred functions and in study, so that he became a most learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. To profound learning and rich eloquence he united great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life".

<p>When the troops of <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, burning and pillaging as they went, entered <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1552, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, religious, and most of the inhabitants fled from the city. Father Wild remained. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> was greatly admired by Albert, who solicited him to give up the religious habit. "For many years", he answered, "I have worn it, it has never done me any harm, why should I now abandon it?" He was ordered to preach in the presence of Albert and his followers on the text, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's", etc. At the end of his discourse he addressed his audience on the text, "Render an account of thy stewardship". The prince was so struck by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> that he promised to grant him any request he would make. He asked that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> buildings should be spared from all <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> and injury. His request was granted, and in recognition of this great service a statute representing Wild holding the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in his hand was placed in the treasury.

<p>His works are numerous, consisting of commentaries on nearly all the parts of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; the Gospels of St. Matthew, St. John, the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, Epistle to the Romans, the First Epistle of St. John, sermons, orations, and ascetical. His method in explaining the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> was to oppose to the captious quotations to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> a learned commentary drawn up from the works of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>. Nearly all his works were published after his death, and had not been composed with a view to publication. With the exception of the Commentaries on Matt., John, and I John, his other works were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> with the clause <em>donec corrigantur.</em> Dominicus a Soto, O.P., extracted from the Commentary of St. John seventy-seven passages which he considered susceptible to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation. He was answered by Michael Medina, O.S.F., who had been <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> with Dominicus at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Sixtus Senensis, Serarius, <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, and many others state that the works of Wild were deliberately altered by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> to deceive the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In the Roman edition of the Commentary on St. John, the passages criticized were left out. J. Wild is mentioned as present at the chapter held at the Convent of Pforzheim on 15 April, 1554. He died the same year, and was buried in the front of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Church at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. His principal works are commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, Judges, Job, Ecclesiastes, Psalms 31 and 60, Esther, Esdras, Nehemias, Lamentations of Jeremias, Jonas, St. Matthew, St. John, <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, Romans, I John; six vols. of sermons; examination of candidates for Sacred Orders.
