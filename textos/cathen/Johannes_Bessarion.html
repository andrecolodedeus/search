<h1>Johannes Bessarion</h1>  

<p>(Or B<font size=-2>ASILIUS</font>).

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, 1389, or according to others, 1395, but most probably in 1403; d. at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> 18 November, 1472. Some claim illustrious parentage for him, but, as to this nothing certain is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In 1413, while still very young, he was sent to Constantinople, where he devoted himself to study, achieving great success in the field of letters. In 1423 he entered the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Order of St. Basil</a> and in the same year was sent to the Peloponnesus to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> under <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Gemistus Pletho</a>. It is known that <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Pletho</a> was a bitter opponent of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, against whom he championed with immoderate <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, without, however, distinguishing between genuine Platonism and <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>. The lessons of <a href="../cathen/12166a.htm">Pletho</a>, though making Bessarion a follower of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, did not prevent him from perceiving the many points of contact between the two <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and, during the revival of ancient learning, constantly defending the harmonizing of the two systems; he criticized the unrestrained partisanship of his master quite as much as that of Michael Apostolius. His learning and eloquence soon excited the admiration and respect of all and brought him, within a short space of time, various <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>. In 1436 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nic&aelig;a, but was not destined to see his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, however, and the emperor, John VIII Pal&aelig;ologus, had him accompany him to the Council of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, which they reached 4 March, 1438. Here his dignity and touching eloquence, as well as his vast <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> erudition, gave him such great authority among the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> issue of the council &#151; the reunion with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> &#151; may be attributed in great part to him. This was fully recognized, as on 6 July, 1439, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Florence, to which the council had been transferred, he was commissioned to read the Greek redaction of the Act of Union.

<p>Bessarion returned to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, but during the same year is found once more at Florence with <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, who, in the consistory of 18 December, 1439 (according to others 8 January, 1440), created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the title of the Twelve Holy Apostles. At the same time another Greek, Archbishop Isidore, received the sacred purple. The brief duration of the union of the churches is well known. Bessarion himself, having changed to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> was cordially <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a>. This notwithstanding, Bessarion continued to work <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the union of the other Oriental <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> churches, the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> and Ethiopians (1442), the Syrians (1444), the Chaldeans and <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> (1445). At this time, also, to refute the accusations of Marcus of Ephesus, against the council, he wrote the book: "De successu synodi florentin&aelig;". <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, like <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, gave evidence of the great regard in which he held the Greek scholar. In 1449 he made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ulazzara and in the same year conferred on him the <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> See of Sabina, for which that of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a> was shortly after substituted. In the following year he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to Bologna, a city torn by constant factional quarrels. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of appointment of 26 February, 1450, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> says he is sending Bessarion <em>tamquam angelum pacis,</em> and expresses the hope that with his experience and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> he may be able to govern the city in peace.

<p>Bessarion continued as governor of Bologna for five years, achieving complete success in calming the internal discord. Not satisfied with that, he introduced wise reforms into the city government and in the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Above all he lavished all his attention and generosity on the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, Bologna's greatest glory, restoring the building which threatened to fall into ruins. He gathered there as teachers the most famous professors of the time, supplying at his own expense the deficiencies in their honoraria, and encouraging with munificence particularly the study of the classics. Thus, he gathered about him a court of poets and men of letters. He was cordial to all, even the lowliest; by stringent legislation he sought to curb immoderate luxury; and he rebuilt and adorned many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of the city, among them that of San Luca. By his prudent and far-seeing administration and his absolute impartiality he won the confidence of the citizens of Bologna, so that on his departure they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> his memory in an inscription; and ever afterwards in all their necessities and in all transactions with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, they had recourse to his intervention.

<p>While Bessarion was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in Bologna, Cardinal Stefano Porcaro was in banishment in that city, being assigned one hundred ducats in addition to the annual pension of three hundred granted him by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Porcaro succeeded in eluding Bessarion's vigilance and escaping to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Bessarion did not delay in apprising the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of his flight. The rest is well known. In 1453 <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> died; and in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> following his death, Bessarion was all but chosen to succeed him; however, <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Calixtus III</a> was finally elected. Constantinople had just fallen into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> had been destroyed. Thereupon Bessarion used all his influences with Francesco Foscari, the Doge of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, as well as with the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to persuade them to take up the offensive against the invading barbarians. Not confining his efforts to words, at the cost of heavy pecuniary <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> he furthered the cause of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was still more pronounced under <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, whose election was due in a special manner to him. In the congress of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, convened by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1459 for the purpose of forming a league of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, Bessarion took a most active part, not justified, however, by results. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his native land impelled him to accept the commission given him by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to attend two German diets held the following year, one on the 2nd of March at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, the other on the 25th of the same month at Worms. Neither, however, had any practical results. At the command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to induce the emperor to assist with arms and supplies <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a>, the young King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. After a long wait the German leaders, 17 September, asked for another delay, and only the express wish of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> kept Bessarion in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> for a whole year, pleading the cause of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the Orient. Internal discord among the German leaders prevented them from reaching any decision concerning the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and Bessarion returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> disillusioned and discouraged. As a reward for his labours the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bestowed on him the commendatory Abbey of Grotta-Ferrata of Greek <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a>, which became a centre of learned pursuits. Shortly afterwards, on the death of Cardinal Isidore, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Kiew and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, Bessarion received the patriarchal title.

<p>In 1463 <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> once more sent him to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to win that republic over to the cause of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, on his own initiative, wished to organize. Long, serious discussions ensued, and at last, in September of the same year, the republic signed a treaty of alliance with <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a>, and on 20 October the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> proclaimed. The results hoped for, however, were not entirely achieved. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> who continued the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, Bessarion withdrew from active affairs and devoted himself entirely to study, cultivating the friendship of many Greek and Italian scientists then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and engaging in learned discussions with them. Thus he won the title of <em>Litterarum patronus</em>. In his house the first <em>Accademia</em> was founded. In 1470 when <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> desired to organize a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, Bessarion wrote the letter "De Bello Turcis inferendo". <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, who approved the plans of his predecessor, sent Bessarion once more as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to settle the discords which had arisen between the first two, and to induce the last-mentioned to join in the great expedition against the enemy of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. On 20 April, 1472, he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> &#151; but was received in an unfriendly manner both in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> so that he was forced to return to report the complete failure of his mission. The disappointment, the discomforts of travelling, and his great age made sad havoc on his strength. At <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to interrupt his journey; there his death occurred at the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, 18 November, 1472. His body was taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> which had been erected in the portico of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Conventual <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, close by the Basilica of the Twelve Holy Apostles. A simple sarcophagus, on which is inscribed a Greek distich of his own composition, contains his remains.

<p>All the aspirations of Bessarion, which, more than great, were unique, were absorbed by three <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>: the union of the Oriental Church with the Latin, the rescue of Greek lands from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> yoke, and the triumph of classic literature and philosophy, especially the Greek. If the realization of the first two was only partial or, in a way, temporary, the third was certainly fulfilled to a more complete degree than perhaps Bessarion himself had dared hope. His labours in that direction had lasting success. By his translations of Xenophon's "Memorabilia", <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Metaphysics", etc., he paved the way for a more exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the real thought of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Stagyrite</a>. His part in the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> has already been mentioned. In this contest of intelligence, he wrote the works "In calumniatorem Platonis" against <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a>, who in his translation of the Laws of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had sharply criticized their author, exalting <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> instead. In the fifth book of his work, Bessarion, in turn, enumerates the faults of translation and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in the commentary of George. At a tremendous outlay, he gathered together a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of eight hundred <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and still at his own expense had many others copied by men of letters. After 1464 he gave these treasures to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> with which he had always been in the greatest sympathy. These <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> formed the nucleus of the famous "Bibliotheca Sancti Marci".
