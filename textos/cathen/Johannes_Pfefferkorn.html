<h1>Johannes Pfefferkorn</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, b. probably at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, 1469; d. at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, between 1521 and 1524. In 1505, after many years of wandering, he, together with his wife and children, was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at Cologne. He soon became known through his efforts for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and his controversy with Reuchlin. In "Der Judenspiegel" (Cologne, 1507), he demanded that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should give up the practice of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, work for their living, attend <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sermons, and do away with the Books of the Talmud, which caused such <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. On the other hand, he condemned the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as an obstacle to their conversion, and defended them against the charge of murdering <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> children for ritual purposes. Bitterly opposed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on account of this work, he virulently attacked them in: "Wie die blinden J&uuml;den ihr Ostern halten" (1508); "Judenbeicht" (1508); and "Judenfeind" (1509). Convinced that the principal source of the obduracy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> lay in their books, he tried to have them seized and destroyed. He obtained from several <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> recommendations to Kunigunde, the sister of the Emperor Maximilian, and through her influence to the emperor himself. On 19 August, 1509, Maximilian ordered the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to deliver to Pfefferkorn all books opposing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Pfefferkorn began the work of confiscation at Frankfort-on-the- Main; thence he went to Worms, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Bingen, Lorch, Lahnstein, and Deutz. But a new imperial mandate of 10 Nov., 1509, gave the direction of the whole affair to the Elector and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Uriel von Gemmingen, with orders to secure opinions from the Universities of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Erfurt, and Heidelberg, from the inquisitor Jakob Hochstraten of Cologne, from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Victor von Carben, and from Johann Reuchlin. Pfefferkorn, in order to vindicate his action and to gain still further the good will of the emperor, wrote "In Lob und Eer dem allerdurchleuchtigsten grossmechtigsten F&#252;rsten und Herrn Maximilian" (Cologne, 1510). In April he was again at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and with the delegate of the Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Professor Hermann Ortlieb, he undertook a new confiscation.

<p>Hochstraten and the Universities of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Cologne decided (Oct 1510) against the Jewish books. Reuchlin declared that only those books obviously offensive (as the "Nizachon" and "Toldoth Jeschu") would be destroyed. The elector sent all the answers received at the end of October to the emperor through Pfefferkorn. Thus informed of Reuchlin's vote Pfefferkorn was greatly excited, and answered with "Handspiegel" (Mainz, 1511), in which he attacked Reuchlin unmercifully. Reuchlin complained to the Emperor Maximilian, and he answered Pfefferkorn's attack with his "Augenspiegel", against which Pfefferkorn published his "Brandspiegel". In June, 1513, both parties were silenced by the emperor. Pfefferkorn however published in 1514 a new polemic, "Sturmglock", against both the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Reuchlin. During the controversy between Reuchlin and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Cologne, Pfefferkorn was assailed in the "Epistol&aelig; obscurorum virorum" by the young Humanists who espoused Reuchlin's cause. He replied with "Beschirmung", or "Defensio J. Pepericorni contra famosas et criminales obscurorum virorum epistolas" (Cologne, 1516), "Streitb&uuml;chlein" (1517). When in 1520 Reuchlin's case was decided in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the condemnation of "Augenspiegel", Pfefferkorn wrote as an expression of his triumph "Ein mitleidliche Klag" (Cologne, 1521). Pfefferkorn was a fanatic and his public and literary life had little of sympathy or grace, but he was certainly an honourable character and the caricature which his opponents have drawn of him is far from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.
