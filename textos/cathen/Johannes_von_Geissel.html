<h1>Johannes von Geissel</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, b. 5 February, 1796, at Gimmeldingen, in the Palatinate; d. 8 September, 1864, at Cologne. After completing his classical studies at Neustadt-on-the-Hardt, and at Edesheim, he was received into the then imperial Lyceum of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1813, and studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the same city, under Prof. Liebermann, from 1815 to 18. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 22 August, 1818. For a short time he became assistant in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Hambach. On 1 February, 1819, he was appointed professor at the Gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>; on 24 June, 1822, canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>; and on 25 May, 1836, dean of that body. Nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> by the King of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 20 May, 1837, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Augsburg <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the following 13 August.

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> displayed such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and efficiency that after four years he was called to a larger sphere of activity. After the accession to the throne of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> of Frederick William IV, the "conflict of Cologne" was to be settled amicably by an agreement between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, to the effect that <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Archbishop Clemens August von Droste-Vischering</a> would relinquish the personal direction of the archdiocese, which should pass over to a coadjutor with the right of succession. On 24 September, 1841, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> appointed Geissel coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; and on 4 March, 1842, he entered upon the administration of the archdiocese. When Clemens August died (19 October, 1845), Geissel succeeded him, and was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 11 January, 1846. Finally, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, 30 September, 1850.

<p>Geissel was a man of many gifts and great energy, one of the foremost German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the nineteenth century. His services in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> are of permanent value. Discretion and a sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the part of the government of Frederick William IV made it possible for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to regulate and ameliorate the conditions of the archdiocese in harmony with the policy of the State. He ended the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> dissensions created by the <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesian</a> School by suspending the refractory <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesian</a> professors Braun and <a href="../cathen/01104a.htm">Achterfeldt</a> of Bonn; and he reorganized the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of that <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by calling in as professors <a href="../cathen/04786c.htm">Dieringer</a> and Martin, men of unsuspected <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. He was also solicitous for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and established two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for boys at Neuss and M&uuml;nstereifel. To instill new <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> into the spiritual life of his people he encouraged popular missions, introduced <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations into the archdiocese, instituted the Perpetual Adoration, and stimulated <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> by celebrating with unusual splendour the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception. Of still greater importance for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was his convocation of the German episcopate to a meeting at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1848. The result of this meeting of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was a number of momentous deliberations for the future prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1860 he held a provincial council at Cologne. Another matter which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had at heart during his life, was the completion of Cologne <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the preparations for which had commenced in 1842. Geissel lived long enough to see the edifice completed and dedicate in October, 1863.

<p>In the years preceding his elevation to the episcopal dignity, Geissel also displayed notable literary activity. During the first two decades of its existence (1821-37) he contributed numerous anonymous essays of either serious or humorously-satirical character on questions and occurrences of the day to the "Katholik", and became one of the foremost contributors to that periodical. His unusual poetical talent is shown by a number of poems, mostly of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, and published partly in that periodical, partly issued singly, as the occasion offered. After his death there appeared a special edition of his "Festgedicht auf die Grundsteinlegung zum Fortbau des K&ouml;lner Doms" (Cologne, 1865). However, his most marked effort as a writer is his historical work, "Der Kaiser-Dom zu Speyer. Eine topographisch-historische Monographie" (3 vols., Mainz, 1828); 2nd ed. in one volume, as Vol. IV of his "Schriften und Reden" (Cologne, 1876).

<p>Other historical writings of less significance are: "Der Kirchensprengel des alten Bisthums Speyer" (Speyer, 1832); "Die Schlacht am Hasenb&uuml;hl und das K&ouml;nigskreuz zu G&ouml;llheim" (Speyer, 1835). Of other separate writings are to be mentioned" Sammlung aller Gesetze und Verordnungen &uuml;ber das Kirchen- und Schulwesen im bayerischen Rheinkreise vom Jahre 1796-1830" (Speyer, 1830); "Die religi&ouml;se Erziehung der Kinder aus gemischten Ehen. Eine geschiehtlichen-rechtliche Er&ouml;rterung" (Speyer, 1837); first published in the "Katholik", vols. LXIII, LXIV (1837). His pastoral letters, memoirs and addresses, composed by him during his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, show a great mind and heart. They have been collected with other dispersed and minor writings of earlier days, and various poems, in "Schriften und Reden von Johannes Cardinal von Geissel, Erzbischof von K&ouml;ln, herausgegeben von Karl Theodor Dumont" (Vols. I-III, Cologne, 1869-70); later on vol. IV was added, "Der Kaiserdom zu Speyer", 2nd ed. (1876).
