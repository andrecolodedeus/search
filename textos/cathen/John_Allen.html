<h1>John Allen</h1>  

<p>(1476-1534)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, canonist, and Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Oxford and Cambridge, graduated in the latter place, and spent some years in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, partly at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for studies and for business of <a href="../cathen/15554a.htm">Archbishop Warham</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 25 August, 1499, and held various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> until 1522, about which time he attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, whose supple and helpful commissary he was in the matter of the suppression of the minor <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. As such, his conduct, says Dr. Gairdner, "gave rise to considerable outcry, and complaints were made about it to the king". He continued to receive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> advancement, assisted <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> in his legatine functions, among other things "in the collusive suit shamefully instituted by the <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">cardinal</a> against the king in May, 1527, by which it was sought at first to have the marriage with Katharine declared invalid without her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" (Gairdner). In the summer of the same year he accompanied the <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">cardinal</a> on his splendid mission to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and finally (August, 1528) was rewarded with the <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">archiepiscopal see of Dublin</a>. At the same time he was made by the king chancellor if <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (Rymer, "Foedera", London, 1728, XVI, 266, 268). He was relieved from asserting, against Armagh, the legatine authority of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> by the latter's fall (October, 1529). With the rest of the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> he had to pay a heavy fine (1531) for violation of the "Statutes of Provisors" and "Praemunire", in recognizing the legatine authority of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, then, in the king's eyes, a heinous crime, and a reason for the <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">cardinal's</a> indictment. Allen wrote a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, "Epistola de pallii significatione activa et passiva" on the occasion of his reception of this pontifical symbol, and another "De consuetudinibus ac statutis in tutoriis causis observandis." He seems also to have been a man of methodical habits, for in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> are still preserved two important registers made by his order, the "Liber Niger", or Black Book, and the "Repertorium Viride", or Green Repertory, both so called, after the custom of the age, from the colour of the binding. The former is a <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">"chartularium"</a> of the archdiocese, or collection of its most important documents, and the latter a full description of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> as it was in 1530. Archbishop Allen was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 28 July, 1534. As a former follower of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the followers of the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> house of Kildare (Fitzgerald), whose chief, the ninth earl, had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> in the Tower from 1526 to 1530, and again, by the King, early in 1534. Soon a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> rumour spread through <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> that the earl had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and the archbishop was killed in consequence of it by two retainers of his son, the famous "Silken Thomas" Fitzgerald. It does not appear that Lord Thomas contemplated the crime or approved of it. He afterwards sent his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> for him from the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> incurred by this <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Sir James Ware says of Allen ("Works", ed. Harris, Dublin, 1764, ap. Webb, "comp. Of Irish Biogr.", Dublin, 1878, 3) that "he was of a turbulent spirit, but a man of hospitality and learning, and a diligent inquirer into antiquities." He belonged to the shifty and unprincipled class of which Thomas Cromwell was leader and mouthpiece, and he closed unworthily the series of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>; his successor, George Browne, was a formal <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> and begins the list of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.
