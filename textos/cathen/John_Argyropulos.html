<h1>John Argyropulos</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a>, and translator of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, born at Constantinople, 1416; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 1486. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was a teacher at Padua in 1434, although it is not clear why he returned to Constantinople in 1441. After the conquest of his native city by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1453) he joined the band of scholars who took refuge in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1456 he was summoned to Florence by Cosimo de' Medici for the purpose of teaching (<a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a>) <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and instructing the youthful Pietro and Lorenzo. In 1471 a plague broke out in Florence: this was the occasion of his leaving Florence for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was kindly received by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a>. There he continued his career as teacher, having among his pupils many <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and some distinguished foreigners, such as <a href="../cathen/12798a.htm">Reuchlin</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the year of his death is uncertain, but 1486 is the most probable <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. He was one of those who contributed most to the revival of Greek learning in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After <a href="../cathen/09614a.htm">Manuel Chrysoloras</a>, he and <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a> and George Gemistius had the largest share in making known to Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the treasures of ancient Greek literature. Like all other <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, he was somewhat intemperate in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for his chosen subject. In his desire to extol the excellence of Greek literature, he expressed his contempt for the literature of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; he was especially severe in his criticism of Cicero. His most serviceable works are his translations of many of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> works (published by Aldo Manucci, 1518-20) and his Commentaries on the "Ethics" and the "Politics" (published 1541). He also wrote several <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises, including one on the "Procession of the Holy Ghost" (P.G., CLVIII, 991 sqq.). Many of his works are still in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
