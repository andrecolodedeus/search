<h1>John Austin</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> lawyer and writer, born 1613 at Walpole, in Norfolk; died London, 1669. He was a student of St. John's College, Cambridge, and of Lincoln's Inn, and about 1640 embraced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He was highly esteemed in his profession and was looked on as a master of English style. His time was entirely devoted to books and literary pursuits. He enjoyed the friendship of such scholars as the antiquary Blount, Christopher Davenport (Franciscus a Santa Clara), <a href="../cathen/13727a.htm">John Sergeant</a>, and others. Among his writings are: "The Christian Moderator; or Persecution for Religion condemned by the Light of Nature, by the Law of God, the Evidence of our Principles, but not by the Practice of our Commissioners for Sequestrations--In Four Parts" (London, 1652, 4to.) . It was published under the pseudonym of William Birchley, and in it he frequently disclaims the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> deposing power. "In his work, Autin assuming the disguise of an independent, shows that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> did not really holds the odious doctrines vulgarly attributed to them, and makes an energetic appeal to the independents to extend to the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> church such <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges as were granted to other religious bodies" (Dict. of Nat. Biogr., II, 264). "The Catholique's Plea; or an Explanation of the Roman Catholik Belief, concerning their Church, Manner of Worship, Justification, Civil Government, Together with a Catalogue of all the Poenal Statutes against popish Recusants, all which is humbly submitted to serious consideration, By a Catholick Gentleman" (London, 1659, 18mo.) also under the pseudonym of William Birchley; "Reflections upon the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; or the Christian Moderator, The Fourth Part, By a Catholick Gentleman, an obedient son of the Church and loyal subject of his Majesty" (London, 1661); "A Punctual Answer to Doctor John Tillotson's book called 'The Rule of Faith'" (unfinished), "Devotions, First Part: In the Ancient Way of Offices, With Psalms, Hymns, and Prayers for every Day in the Week, and every Holiday in the Year". It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when and where the first edition appeared; the second, a duodecimo, is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1672. An edition printed at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 1789, contains a life of the author, presumably by <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a>. This work was adapted to the uses of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> in Hick's "Harmony of the Gospels", etc., (London, 1701), and has been often reprinted as a stock book under the Hick's Devotions. "Devotions, Second Part, The Four Gospels in one, broken into Lessons, with Responsories, To be used with the Offices, Printed Anno Domini 1675" (2 vols., Paris, 12mo), a posthumous work, divided into short chapters with a verse and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the end of each. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, says Gillow, "gave rise to offense under the impression that they favoured <a href="../cathen/15613a.htm">Blackloe's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the middle state of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and on account of this the work was not republished". A third part of the "Devotions" was never printed; it contained, according to the author's own statement "Prayers for all occasions framed by an intimate friend according to his (Austin's) directions, and overlooked by himself". He also wrote several anonymous pamphlets against the divines who sat in the Westminster Assembly.
