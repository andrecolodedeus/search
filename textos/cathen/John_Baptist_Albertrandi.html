<h1>John Baptist Albertrandi</h1>  

<p>(Also called Jan Chrzciciel, or Christian.)

<p>A Polish <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, of Italian extraction, born at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, 7 December, 1731; died August, 1808. He entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 14 August, 1748, and left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> shortly before the suppression, probably in 1769, for his name is not found in the catalog of 1770. After teaching literature for twelve years in the various <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he was entrusted with the care of the great <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> founded by Zaluski, the famous <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and litterateur, who had revived literature in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. This <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which he bequeathed to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> was seized by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and now forms the nucleus of the Imperial library. Subsequently Albertrandi accepted the charge of preceptor to the nephew of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a>, Archbishop Lubienski. With his pupil, who afterwards became Minister of Justice in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he traveled through the various countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, chiefly <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to gather material for a great history of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. With his own hand he copied <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> referring to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> wherever he found them and in three years amassed a collection of one hundred and ten folio volumes. Where he was not allowed to copy he read and, on returning home in the evening, wrote out what his prodigious <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> retained. Sommervogel says that the net result was two hundred folio volumes. He is called the Polish Polyhistor. His style is rapid, orderly, and methodical. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and most of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages. His published works are: Two volumes of a translation of Macquer's "Roman History"; and abridged "Annals of Poland"; a great number of articles in the "Moniteur", a journal of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. He also collaborated with Father Naruszewicz, S.J., in a periodical called "Agreeable and Useful Recreations", and produced a work on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>, besides many discourses for the Academy of Warsaw, which he founded. After leaving the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, he became Royal Librarian and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zenopolis, and was decorated with the Order of St. Stanislaus. In his work in the Royal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, he not only published a catalog in ten volumes octavo, but left critical remarks in each of the books. He also had ready for publication <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> on the history of the three last centuries of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, explained by medals; Polish annals up to the reign of Vladislaus IV; and a "History of Stephen Bori". This last has been published.
