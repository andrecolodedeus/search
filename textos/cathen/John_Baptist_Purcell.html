<h1>John Baptist Purcell</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, born at Mallow, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 26 Feb., 1800; died at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Brown County, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 4 July, 1883. Of his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> but few particulars can be found. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Edward and Johanna Purcell, being industrious and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, gave their children all the advantages of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> attainable at a time when the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> were less rigorously enforced. John displayed remarkable talent and mastered all the branches of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> curriculum before his eighteenth year. Entrance into the colleges of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was an impossibility. He therefore decided to seek in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> denied him in his native country. Landing at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> be applied for and obtained a teacher's certificate in the Asbury College. He spent about one year in giving lessons as private tutor in some of the prominent <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. His <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and this he never lost sight of while teaching others as a means of obtaining a livelihood. On 20 June, 1820, he entered Mount St.Mary's Seminary, Emmitsburg. His previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the classics made it an easy task for him to take charge of important classes in the college, and at the same time prepare himself for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and other branches of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, After three years' study in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> he received <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> from Archbishop Mareschal, of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, at the close of 1823. On 1 March, 1824, in the company of Rev. Simon Gabriel Brut&eacute;, one of the professors of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, he sailed for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to complete his studies in the Sulpician Seminaries of Issy and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 26 May, 1826, he was one of the three hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by Archbishop de Quelen. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he continued his studies until the autumn of 1827, when he returned to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to enter Mount St. Mary's Seminary as professor, He afterwards became president, until his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, to succeed the saintly Fenwick. He received notice of his appointment in Aug., 1833, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 13 Oct., 1833, by Archbishop Whitfield. He attended the sessions of the Third <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, which opened on the day of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and continued for one week.

<p>After winding up his affairs in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, be set out for the scene of his life's work. Going from <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> by stage to <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a> to Cincinnati by steamboat, he reached his destination 14 Nov., 1833. Bishops Flaget, David of Bardstown, Rese of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, and a few <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> met him and conducted him to his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was on Sycamore Street. He was canonically installed by Bishop Flaget, who made the address of welcome. After the installation Bishop Rese, who had been administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> during the vacancy, made the legal transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in his charge. The site of the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and at that time the only church in the city, a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> structure, is now occupied by the imposing St. Xavier's Church, accommodating over one thousand <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>. On his arrival in 1833 Bishop Purcell found himself in a city of about 30,000 inhabitants and only one church. The diocese embraced the whole <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>. The prospect presented to the young <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, then in his thirty-third year, was enough to fill his mind with misgiving and dread. The difficulties increased, for soon the tide of immigration turned towards <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, Immigrants from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> came in thousands, and as they were all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> it became his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to provide for their spiritual wants, and that had to be done quickly. A <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> had been founded by Bishop Fenwick in the Athen&aelig;um, which stood near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The number of students was of course very small, but Bishop Purcell had to rely on this little band to help him in his work. He began his work as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with an energy and earnestness that never flagged during his whole life. He was untiring in his labour, preaching and giving lectures, writing articles for the "Telegraph", a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper founded by Father Young, a nephew of Bishop Fenwick, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper published in the West. He taught classes in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. At his first <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> Juncker, afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, Illinois. He lost no time in providing for the wants of the growing Church in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> on Fifth Street, the first church built for the German-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, was soon followed by another, St. Mary's, at Clay and Thirteenth Streets. Finding it impossible to provide professors or give his own time to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, he called to his aid the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, to whom be gave over the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> on Sycamore Street, and purchased a site for his new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on Plum and Eighth Streets, and Western Row, then the western boundary of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. Western Row is now Central Avenue. The new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a magnificent structure 200 feet long and 80 feet wide, built of Dayton limestone, with its beautiful spire of solid stone rising to the height of 225 feet, is one of the finest in the West. This grand temple was completed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 26 Oct., 1846, thirteen years after Bishop Purcell's arrival at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. After trying several locations for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, he finally located it on Price Hill, west of the city limits. The main building was completed and opened for the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in 1851. He called it Mount St. Mary's of the West, after his own <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater at Emmitsburg. Two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> were established, St. Aloysius's for the children of German-speaking <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and St. Peter's, now St. Joseph's, for children of English-speaking people, and provision was made for their maintenance.



<p>He made a complete visitation of his extensive diocese the first year of his administration, providing for the spiritual care of his scattered flock, either placing resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or having <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to visit regularly the smaller communities that were unable to support a resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1940 the canal and railway systems that were to revolutionize the existing conditions of commerce were begun and continued without interruption until 1854. Little Miami Railroad from Xenia to <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, a distance of 65 miles, was opened for traffic in 1841. It is now a link in the great <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> system. These public works brought immense numbers of emigrants to the state. What were villages soon grew into cities; Cleveland, Toledo, <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a>, Dayton, and Hamilton became the cities of the state. New <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were formed, and churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were built. Cleveland became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1847, and <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a> in 1868. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to call on <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for help to meet the fast-growing wants of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>Bishop Purcell made several trips to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, visiting the various <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> there, and soliciting students having the missionary spirit to share his labours in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. On his return from one of these trips to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he was accompanied by a band of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Fathers Machebeuf, Lamy, Gacon, Cheymol, and Navaron. Father Machebeuf afterwards became first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>; Father Lamy, first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santa F&eacute;. The others lived to a ripe old age, doing missionary work in the diocese till <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called them to their reward. While the state was growing in population, the city of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> did not lag behind. Cist's "Cincinnati" (1851), in its church statistics, gives the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 13 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 11 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with an enrollment of 4494 pupils. Bishop Purcell from the beginning was an earnest advocate of the establishment of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The rapid growth of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and the West was recognized in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1850 Cincinnati was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> was conferred on Archbishop Purcell by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, who at the same time made him assistant at the pontifical throne, in appreciation of his personal worth. The new <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> had for suffragans the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>.

<p>In 1861 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> did not hesitate in making known his views on the Civil War. He decided to fly the flag from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> spire. This action of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> called forth a great deal of adverse criticism, as there was at the time an influential party in the North opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were in sympathy with this party. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> boldly took his stand and ignored the adverse criticism. The event showed the wisdom of his course. The last vestige of insane <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothingism</a> and its <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> disappeared. This wave of bigotry which spread over the whole country in the early fifties had showed itself decidedly hostile to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Cincinnati in 1854, when <a href="../cathen/02387a.htm">Archbishop Bedini</a> was the guest of Archbishop Purcell. The firm stand taken by the German and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> overawed the mob that threatened to destroy the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and thus prevented bloodshed.

<p>Archbishop Purcell attended the Council of the Vatican, and in the discussion of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> he took the side of the minority which opposed the opportuneness of the decision, but on his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which he left before the question was decided, he gave in his adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as soon as he learned of the signing of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>. This he did in a sermon he preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> saying, "I am here to proclaim my <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a> in the words of the Holy Father defining the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>".

<p>He celebrated his golden jubilee of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> 26 May, 1876. He was joined in this celebration not only by his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> but by the whole country. Bishops and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> came personally or sent representatives. He had reason to rejoice when he saw the result of his work. When he came to Cincinnati he found a small city with but one church, and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered through the state. After forty-three years of toil he found the city grown to a population of nearly 300,000, with forty well-organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> having <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> giving <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to 20,000 children, a well-equipped <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> to take care of the poor and sick. Throughout the diocese were well-organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Forty years before he had only a few priests; in 1876 he could count on the help of 150 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and 50 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 150,000. In reply to the addresses of congratulation on the occasion, he modestly referred the success to the cordial assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the generous aid of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.

<p>The serious financial disaster that clouded his last years was the result of circumstances for which he could hardly be responsible. Giving all his time to the spiritual management of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he left the material part altogether in the hands of his brother, Father Edward Purcell. He received deposits from people who were mistrustful of the banks, which were unstable institutions until the general government adopted the national banking system during the War of Rebellion. The large amount involved represented the accumulation of compound interest. This financial disaster crushed out the lives of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his brother. The crash came in the autumn of 1878, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> died five years later. His brother had passed away in the spring of the preceding year.

<p>After fourteen years of litigation and the mismanagement of the assignees, the affair came to an end, when the court found the amount due on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions to be $140,000. Archbishop Elder accepted the findings of the court and made arrangement by a system of assessments on the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> to meet the loans made to pay the amount required by the final decision. This decision was made in 1892. Under the wise administration of Archbishop Elder, who succeeded Archbishop Purcell, all the loans have been paid off.

<p>In 1837 Bishop Purcell, wishing to come in touch with the learned men of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, became a member of the Ohio College of Teachers. At one of the meetings the discussion turned on religion, and some remarks were made reflecting on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Bishop Purcell asked leave to reply to them at length. This permission could not be granted under the rules limiting speeches to ten minutes. In a spirit of fairness, Dr. Wilson offered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the use of his church on Fourth and Main Streets to reply. This offer was gladly accepted, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> delivered a masterly discourse. The position and teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were put before the people of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> so clearly and forcibly as to cause many who heard the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at least to reconsider the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> they had formed of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and practice. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was unfavourably known by non-Catholics at the time, owing to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> charges made by preachers and the spread of anti-Catholic literature giving <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> views of her teaching and practice. The lecture was a surprise to many who had up to that time looked upon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as a danger to the country. It stirred up a great deal of discussion in the community, so much so that Alexander Campbelle, founder of the Campbellite wing of the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church, felt called to take upon himself the defence of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He sent a letter to Bishop Purcell challenging him to a publie debate. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with a great deal of reluctance accepted the challenge, and invited Mr. Campbelle to call at his residence in the Athen&aelig;um on Sycamore Street to arrange for the debate. The meeting took place at 2 p. m. on 11 Jan., 1837. It was agreed to hold a debate in the <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist</a> Church, now St. Thomas's Catholic Church, on Sycamore Street. The debate was to begin 13 Feb. and to continue seven days, exclusive of Sunday. Two sessions were to be held each day, the morning session from 9 to 12.30, the afternoon from 3 to 5. The debate was to be held under the direction of five moderators, two to be chosen by each of the disputants, these four to choose a fifth.

<p>Mr. Campbelle was to open the discussion, Bishop Purcell to reply. The discussion was to be taken down by shorthand writers, printed after revision by the disputants, and sold, the net proceeds to be distributed equally among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> charities. The moderators selected were Messrs. Samuel Lewis, Thomas J. Briggs, William Disney, John Rogers, and J. W. Piatt.

<p>Mr. Campbelle's charges were: <ul><li>(1) The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not now nor was she ever <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Apostolic, or Holy, but is a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in the fair import of the word, older than the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> now existing, not the Mother and Mistress of Churches, but an apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <li>(2) The notion of <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> is without foundation in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and reason. <li>(3) She is not uniform in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but fallible and changeable as other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> in religion and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <li>(4) She is the Babylon of St. John. <li>(5) <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, confession, and <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> are immoral in their tendencies, injurious to the well-being of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, political and religious. <li>(6) The world is not indebted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. <li>(7) If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and unchangeable, she is opposed to the spirit of the institutions of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, which means progress.</ul>

<p>At the close of the debate one of the city papers said "Catholicity lost nothing and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> gained nothing by the discussion." It made a profound impression on the community at large. <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> was brought before the people in a way they had never understood it before. Thinking men were led to lay aside the prejudice caused by their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Bishop Purcell's ability as a public teacher was recognized and his learning respected. The reputation and standing he acquired by this discussion he maintained during his entire administration. The members of his own flock were encouraged when they found their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> so competent to teach them their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and defend it against the attacks of non-Catholics. The discussion brought him into prominence throughout the whole country. He was called upon to deliver lectures and preach sermons in nearly every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was looked upon as the representative <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the West, as Archbishop Hughes was of the East.

<p>In 1867 Mr. Vickers preached a sermon at the laying of the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of St. John's Evangelical Church, in which he made charges against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Archbishop Purcell felt called upon to take notice of Mr. Vickers's sermon. This he did in a sermon preached at the laying of the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of St. Rose's Church. This brought on a discussion in the columns of the "Catholic Telegraph" and the "Cincinnati Gazette". The discussion attracted little attention, as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had to patiently follow his opponent, refuting the oft-repeated <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> charges against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The observatory <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid on Mount Adams 9 Nov., 1842, by John Quincy Adams, ex-president of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He is reported to have said in the course of his speech, "this observatory is to be a beacon of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, that should never be obscured by the dark shadows of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and intolerance symbolized by the Popish Cross". The position is now the site of the Holy Cross Monastery of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> dedicated 22 June, 1873, when the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> preached a most eloquent sermon on the "Triumph of the Cross". This was his reply to the remarks of John Quincy Adams and his slur on the Cross of Christ. He had before that placed the cross above the observatory when he built his votive church called the "Immaculata" on Mount Adams.

<p>The following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders came to the archdiocese during the incumbency of Archbishop Purcell: &mdash; the Sisters of Charity, founded at Emmitsburg, came to Cincinnati in 1829, in union with the Sisters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In the changes, the Sisters formed an independent community, taking the name of the Sisters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. Archbishop Purcell received their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in 1852. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> took charge of the college in 1840, and the congregation in 1847. The Sisters of Notre Dame of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, came to Cincinnati in 1840. The Precious Blood Fathers came to <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> in 1840. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers came to the diocese in 1844; the Good Shepherd Sisters in 1857; the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> in 1858; <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> in 1868; <a href="../cathen/12257a.htm">Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis</a> in 1858; Ladies of the Sacred Heart in 1869; and the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers in 1870.
