<h1>John Baptist Tolomei</h1>  

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a>, at Camberaia, between Pistoia and Florence, 3 Dec., 1653; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Roman College, 19 Jan., 1726, and was buried before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Saint Ignatius. At the age of fifteen, after an early schooling at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12112a.htm">University of Pisa</a>; on 18 Feb., 1673, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was master of eleven languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, English, French, Spanish, <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyrian</a>, and Italian. He began his public career at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by expounding the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> on Sunday evenings in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Ges&ugrave;. At the age of thirty he was elected in the General Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general of the order, which office he held for five years, relinquishing it to take the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the Roman College. Here his lecture-room was thronged. His lectures were printed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1696 under the title of "Philosophia mentis et sensuum", and demonstrated that, while loyal to the principles and method of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, he welcomed every discovery of his time in the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and wove these into his course. The lectures were reprinted in 1698 in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and evoked the warmest encomiums from the Academy of Leipzig as well as from Leibniz. He later filled the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Roman College (now the Gregorian University) and renewed the courses in controversial <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> begun by <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> a century before. These lectures in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> filled six volumes in folio but were never printed. Successively Rector of the Roman College and of the German College, he was at the same time Consultor of the Congregations of Rites, of the Index, and of Indulgences, as well as being one of the appointed examiners of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. On 17 May, 1712, unexpectedly created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, under the title of Santo Stefano in Monte C&oelig;lio, he became chief adviser to the pontiff in matters <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, particularly in the preparation of the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. His published works are the "Philosophia mentis et sensuum" (with the addition of natural <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and ethics, Rome, 1702), "De primatu beati Petri" (in the second series of the miscellany printed from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Roman College, Rome, 1867), and a little pamphlet containing "Daily Prayers for a Happy Death" (in Latin, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1742; also in German, Augsburg, 1856).
