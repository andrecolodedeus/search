<h1>John Barclay</h1>  

<p>Author of the political novel "Argenis" and other Latin works in prose and verse, was b. 28 January, 1582, at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, August, 1621. His father was <a href="../cathen/02291c.htm">William Barclay</a>. John Barclay received his early schooling from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and at the age of nineteen he published a commentary on the "Thebais" of Statius. In 1603 father and son, perhaps attracted by the union of the Scotch and English crowns, tried their fortunes in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. The son dedicated to James his "Euphormionis Lusinini Satyricon". After a brief stay in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, John returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1605.

<p>He married a brilliant and clever Frenchwoman, and was again in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1606. He published, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1607, the second part of his "Satyricon" and about the same time his poems, under the title "Sylvae", and a narrative of the <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a> (English translation, Oxford, 1634). His publication in 1609 of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> work, "De Potestate Papae", which denied the temporal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over princes, and his declaration therewith that he would defend his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> memory, led to a prolonged controversy, in which his known opponents were <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Andreas Eudaemon Joannes. A further series of polemics was occasioned by his "Apology" (1611) for the "Satyricon", in which he attacked the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> former patron, the Duke of Lorraine. In his "Icon Animorum", a fourth part of the Satyricon" (London, 1614), he described the character and manners of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations, mentioning <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> with special affection. In 1615 a volume of his poems appeared in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Barclay received occasional help from the king and the Earl of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and won the friendship of Isaac Casaubon, Ralph Thorie, and especially, in 1606, of du Peiresc, an attache of the French Embassy and a patron of learning. In 1616 Barclay, at the invitation of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was welcomed by <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and pensioned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Perhaps to prove his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> loyalty he published in 1617 his "Paraenesis ad Sectarios". Completing in July, 1621, his Latin novel "Argenis", he died in the following month. The facts as to the removal of his monument and inscription from St. Onofrio have been perhaps permanently obscured by partisan dispute. His friend Ralph Thorie published an elegy in 1621. Barclay was admired by his contemporaries for his honesty, his rare courtesy, and a conversational charm that owed something to grave irony. His varied learning and talents made him a formidable opponent.

<p>The most important of Barclay's writings, the "Argenis", published by du Peiresc at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1621, has been admired by <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, Leibnitz, Jonson, Grotius, Pope, Cowper, Disraeli, and Coleridge. This work is a long romance which introduces the leading personages of international importance. To it were indebted, in whole or in part, <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon's</a> "Telemaque", du Ryer's tragi-comedy "Argenis et Poliarque", <a href="../cathen/03156a.htm">Calderon's</a> "Argenis y Poliarco", an Italian play "Argenide", by de Cruylles, and a German play by Christian Weysen, 1684. The "Argenis" was soon translated into French, Spanish, and German. English translations appeared as follows: by Kingsmill Long, London, 1626; by Sir Robert Le Grys and Thomas May, London, 1629, and in 1772, under the title of "The Phoenix", by Clara Reeve. Ben Jonson in 1623 entered a translation at Stationers' Hall. There have been translations into Italian, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, Greek, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a>, Polish, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a>. An English translation, by Thomas May of the fourth part of the "Satyricon", under the title, "The Mirror for Minds", was printed in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1633.

<p>Portraits of Barclay may be found in the first edition of the "Argenis", in the volume of 1629 of Le Grys and May, and in the later work of Collignon.
