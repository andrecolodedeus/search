<h1>John Barrow</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a>, descended from a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of stanch <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> yeomen, b. 13 May, 1735, at Westby-in-the-Fylde, Lancashire; d. 12 February, 1811, at Claughton, Lancashire. His uncle, Father Edward Barrow, S.J., had been serving the mission at Wesby Hall in 1717 when he was outlawed as a popish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and his goods forfeited. John Barrow, after a course of seven years at the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was impressed at <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a> and served five years in the navy. Deserting at Dunkirk, he was acquitted by the court-martial through pretending successfully to understand no language but Italian. In 1761, after escorting two young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> at Gravelines, where his sister was a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, he resumed his studies at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there 17 June, 1766. After a short stay in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> at the house in Red Lion Square occupied by the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a>, he set out on horseback for Claughton in Lancashire. At this mission, which had been formerly attached to the Hall, the seat of the ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Brockholes, he remained from the time of his arrival, in July, 1766, until his death. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at the adjoining mission of New House.

<p>Father Barrow was a man of notable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, will and industry. He ws a master of French and Italian, wrote elegant Latin and forceful English. "He may sometimes have shown but scant courtesy to the wishes or commands of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but he insisted that everybody else should be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and deferential to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority" (Gillow). He enlarged the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Claughton, in 1794, improved the roads as township overseer, made wise reinvestments of the fund for the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, and negotiated with Sir Edward Smythe for the acquirement by exchange of the land for <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw College</a>. Though his name is on the list of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> writers, no description of his writing is recorded. It is likely that he contributed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee controversy. Gillow's quotations from unpublished letters would imply that Barrow was no gentle opponent. In a letter preserved at Claughton the Cardinal Secretary of State praises warmly Father Barrow's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> loyalty and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the cause of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
