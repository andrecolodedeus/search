<h1>John Bede Polding</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, 18 Oct., 1794; died at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, 16 March, 1877. In 1805 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of St. Gregory at Acton Burnell near <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a> (now <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside Abbey</a> near <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a>). In 1810 he received the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit and made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> the year following. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1819 and filled in turn the offices of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, prefect, novice-master, and sub-prior in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1833 <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> selected Polding <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07344a.htm">Hiero-C&aelig;sarea</a>. It was pointed out, however, that his health could not stand the climate of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> accepted this excuse as sufficient. About this time an <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> was made to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to send a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to New South Wales. Polding was appointed to this newly-created vicariate which, besides New South Wales, included the rest of New Holland and Van Dieman's Land (now Tasmania). The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 29 June, 1834.

<p>Bishop Polding reached Sydney in September, 1835, and at once set to work to organize his vast <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He found only three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in New South Wales and one in Tasmania; these with the three or four <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom he had brought with him constituted the entire force at his disposal. Then, and for many years afterwards, he worked like one of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> daily in various stations, often in the convict <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, teaching the Catechism, hearing the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> of multitudes, and attending the sick and dying. He obtained permission to give <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreats</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> establishments, and between 1836 and 1841 no less than 7000 convicts made at least ten days' <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a> under his guidance. The authorities soon realized the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> effect his influence was having, and arranged that, on the arrival of every ship-load of convicts, all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should be placed at his disposal for some days, during which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his assistants saw each <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> personally and did all they could for them before they were drafted off to their various destinations. In 1841 Bishop Polding revisited <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and thence went on to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to report on his <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11777a.htm">petition</a> for the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, which was granted in 1842, the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> becoming first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of all <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>. During this visit he was sent on a special diplomatic mission to <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, and in recognition of his success therein was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire and an assistant at the pontifical throne. In 1843 he returned to <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, taking with him a band of <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, four <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. His return as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> aroused a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> storm among the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> party in the colony, but his gentleness and tact disarmed all opponents.

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> were held, at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> in 1844 and at <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a> in 1859; he founded the University College of St. John at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> and the College of St. Mary, Lyndhurst. He visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1846-48, in 1854-56, and in 1865-68, returning on each occasion with new helpers in his work. In 1870 he started for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, but his health failed on the journey and he returned to Sydney. In 1873 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/15315a.htm">Dom Roger Bede Vaughan</a>, another <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, as his coadjutor with <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">succession</a>, and from this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he gradually withdrew from active work.
