<h1>John Boyle O'Reilly</h1>  

<p>Poet, novelist, and editor, b. at Douth Castle, Drogheda, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 June, 1844; d. at Hull, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 10 August, 1890; second son of William David O'Reilly and Eliza Boyle. He attended the National School, conducted by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and was employed successively as printer on the "Drogheda Argus", and on the staff of "The Guardian", Preston, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; he afterwards became a trooper in the Tenth Hussars. Entering actively in the Fenian movement, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in his inexperience that <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> grievances could be redressed only by physical force, he was betrayed to the authorities and duly court-martialled. On account of his extreme youth, his life sentence was commuted to twenty years' penal servitude in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>. Later study of his country's cause made him before long an earnest advocate of constitutional agitation as the only way to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Home Rule. In 1869, O'Reilly escaped from <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, with the assistance of the captain of a whaling barque from New Bedford, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. In 1870, he became editor of "The Pilot", <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and from 1876 until his death in 1890 he was also part proprietor, being associated with Archbishop Williams of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. His books include four volumes of poems: "Songs of the Southern Seas", "Songs, Legends, and Ballads", "The Statues in the Block", and "In Bohemia"; a novel, "Moondyne", based on his Australian experiences; his collaboration in another novel, "The King's Men", and "Athletics and Manly Sport". A sincere <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, his great influence, used lavishly in forwarding the interests of younger <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> destined to special careers, and in lifting up the lowly without regard to any claim but their need, was for twenty years a valuable factor in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> progress in America. He was married in 1872 to Mary Murphy, in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, who died in 1897. Their four daughters survive them.
