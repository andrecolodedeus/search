<h1>John Capreolus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born towards the end of the fourteenth century, (about 1380), in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died in that city 6 April, 1444. He has been called the "Prince of Thomists", but only scanty details of his personal history are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. He was a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> affiliated to the province of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and a general chapter of his order at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> in 1407 assigned him to lecture on "The Sentences" in the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. He began in 1408 and achieved success. The following year he finished the first part of his celebrated defensive on commentary on the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. He passed examinations for degrees at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> in 1411 and in 1415. After serving for some time as regent of studies at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he repaired to Rodez where he laboured assiduously at his commentaries completing the three remaining parts in 1426, 1428 and 1433. In the preface of a compendium of Capreolus's work by Isidore de Isolanis, it is stated that these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> once narrowly escaped destruction by fire, a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> having saved them, to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the author, who was then advanced in years. The same authority describes the erudite commentator as having cherished through life a tender <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>. Though following the order of "The Sentences", the commentaries of Capreolus are a calm, learned, and penetrating exposition of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, as well as a comprehensive defence against sundry opponents and critics, including <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, <a href="../cathen/07235b.htm">Henry of Ghent</a>, John of Ripa, Guido (the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>), Aureolus, Durandus <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a>, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Ockham</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>. Copious and apt citations show that the author mastered <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and his Arabic commentator, <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>; but a scrupulous fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelical Doctor</a>, that earned for him the extraordinary appellation of "Soul of St. Thomas", is his chief characteristic.

<p>There is nothing in the wide field of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> discussions of his time that Capreolus did not study and elucidate with precision of insight and reasoning, and express in a style so terse and vigorous that his work is rightly given a place among the most enduring achievements of the golden age of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. The commentaries, bearing slightly variant titles, were published in four folio volumes at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1483, 1514, 1519, 1589. ln 1881, Bishop Borret of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, who had made the life and works of Capreolus, the object of considerable research, suggested a critically revised edition of the commentaries, which was at length undertaken by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. Its publication was begun at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 1900 and is now (1907) nearly compteted in the seventh volume, under the title: "Johannis Capreoli Tholosani, Ordinis Praedicatorum, Thomistarum principis, Defensiones Theologiae Divi Thomae Aq.de novo editae cura et studio RR. PP. Ceslai Paban et Thomae Pegues". Early compendiums of the work by Paul Soncinas and by Sylvester Prierias were much used in their day.
