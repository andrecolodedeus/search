<h1>John Carroll</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, b. at Upper Marlboro, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 8 Jan., 1735; died in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 3 Dec., 1815.

<p>His father, Daniel, born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, settled at Upper Marlboro, where he became a merchant, and married Eleanor Darnall, a relative of the wife of <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>. She was very rich and had been well <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Their first son died in infancy; their second, Daniel, figured prominently in Revolutionary history. John, their third son, was probably <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Boone's Chapel, now Rosaryville, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. When twelve years of age, he went to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in Cecil Co., <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, where he was "assiduous in study, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and amiable". After one year there, he went abroad to <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a> College in French <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and for six years pursued a liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> with "marked capability of mind, attention to studies and docility and kindness of manner". His father died in 1750, and in 1753 John Carroll joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. In 1755 he began his studies of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and after fourteen years (1769) was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the age of thirty-four. The next four years he spent at St.-Omer and at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> teaching philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. During the winter of 1772-3 Father Carroll travelled through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> as preceptor, with the son of Lord Stourton. Upon his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he was, for a short time the guest and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Lord Arundell</a> at Wardour Castle. This year, 1773, <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Pope Clement XIV</a> issued (21 July) and published (16 August) at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressing and dissolving the Society of Jesus</a>. This news reached Father Carroll 5 September, and after writing a vindication of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> he had to provide for his future course of life. In the following spring he returned (26 June) to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and hastened to his mother's home at Rock Creek, with whom and other intimates he had faithfully corresponded while in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. As a result of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> discriminating against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, there was then no public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, so Father Carroll began the life of a missionary in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Virginia. He built a tiny frame <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on his mother's estate and here on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> (in her house on weekdays) he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> when at home. During the next two years he devoted the time left from his devotions to the study of ancient literature and current topics in order to increase his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; yet he did not neglect his social <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Apropos of his support at that time he himself wrote: "Catholics contributed nothing to the support of religion in its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>; the whole maintenance fell on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> themselves. . .the produce of their lands was sufficient to answer their demands."

<p>In 1776, when a committee composed of Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase, and <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a> was about to be sent by the Continental Congress to seek the neutrality of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> during the War of Independence, "by a special resolution (Feb. 15) <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a> was requested to prevail on Mr. John Carroll to accompany the committee to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, to assist them in such matters as they shall think useful". He accepted the honourable office, and spent the remainder of the winter in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; he found, however (Shea, Life and Times of the Most Rev. John Carroll, New York, 1888, 148-53), that it was too late to discuss the question of union with the revolted colonies, or even neutrality, and returned to New York at the end of May in company with Benjamin Franklin. His influence on his fellow-countrymen even at this period may be surmised from the fact that, though out of the constitutions adopted by the Thirteen States, only four did away with the old <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> and allowed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> absolute equality with other citizens, yet these (Pennsylvania, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>) were situated nearest to Father Carroll. During these years he chose to live with his mother, then seventy years old, and refused to accept an assignment elsewhere by Father Lewis, formerly Superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and now <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (or the Western District). Father Lewis, however, did not consider him entitled to support from the income of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, although he had to labour very hard, often riding twenty-five miles on sick-calls. (Shea, op. Cit., 85-86); Campbell in U.S. Cath. Magazine, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 1844, III, 364,365.)

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was over Carroll and five other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> met at Whitemarsh, Md., 27 June, 1783, to discuss ways and means to carry on their missionary work and hold their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> intact. They held a second meeting 6 November, 1783, and a third 11 October, 1784, at the same place, when they formulated the draft of the regulations binding all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Thereby every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was maintained and given thirty pounds a year, and each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> agreed to offer ten Masses for every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who died there. The adopted the following: <blockquote> "It is the opinion of a majority of the chapter that a superior <em>'in spiritualibus'</em>, with powers to give Confirmation, grant faculties, <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> oils, etc., is adequate to the present exigencies of religion in this country. Resolved therefore, <br>"1st, That a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is at present unnecessary. <br>"2nd, that if one is sent it is decided by the majority of the chapter that he shall not be entitled to any support from the present estates of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <br>"3rd, That a committee of three be appointed to prepare and give an answer to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> conformable to the above resolution." </blockquote>



<p>In response to a petition sent by the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 November, 1783, for permission for the missionaries here to nominate a superior who should have some of the powers of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Father Carroll, having been selected, was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 6 June, 1784, as Superior of the Missions in the thirteen <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of North America</a>, with power to give confirmation. He was asked to send a report of the state of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. This same year a minister named Charles Henry Wharton, a Marylander, an ex-Jesuit, and distant relative of Father Carroll, attacked the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was answered by Carroll in "An Address to the Roman Catholics of the United States of North America". Its aim and spirit may be gauged from one of its passages wherein Carroll said: "General and equal toleration, by giving a free circulation to fair argument, is a most effectual method to bring all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to an unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." The work was published at Annapolis in 1784, and is the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> work written by an American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> published in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Father Carroll was, all the while, distracted, personally wishing the rehabilitation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and to remain himself a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. But officially seeing the need of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that too an American, he decided to accept the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> appointment of himself, and forthwith as <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> sent (Feb., 1785), to <a href="../cathen/01584a.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a>, his acceptance of that office, but urged that some method of appointing church authorities be adopted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that would not make it appear as if they were receiving their appointment from a foreign power. A report of the status of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was appended to his letter, where he stated that 9000 were freemen, 3000 children, and 3000 <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> slaves; that some of the more prominent <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, despite the dearth of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (there being then only nineteen in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>) were still <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, sufficiently religious, though prone to dancing and novel-reading. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was so pleased with Father Carroll's report that he granted his request "that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> be allowed to suggest two or three names from which the Pope would choose their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>". In the meanwhile Father Carroll took up his residence in Baltimore (1786-7), where even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were charmed by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> delivered in old St. Peter's church. He took an active part in municipal affairs, especially in establishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and non-Catholic, being president of the Female Humane Charity School of the City of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, one of three trustees for St. John's College at Annapolis, founder of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> (1791), head of the Library Company, the pioneer of the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Historical Society, and President of the trustees of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> College (1803).

<p>He represented to Congress the need of a constitutional provision for the protection and maintenance of religious liberty, and doubtless to him, in part, is due the provision in Article Sixth, Section 3, of the Constitution, which declares that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States", and also the first amendment, passed this same year by the first Congress, that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof: (for a more cautious view see SHEA, op. cit., 348).

<p>Church troubles, Trusteeism in New York, and Nationalism in Philadelphia, at this time decided the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> (March, 1788) to petition <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. <a href="../cathen/01584a.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a> replied, allowing the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on the mission to select the city and, for this case only, to name the candidate for presentation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Twenty-four of the twenty-five other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the meeting voted for Father Carroll. Accordingly on 6 November, 1789, <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in Mr. Weld's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Lulworth Castle, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 15 August, 1790, at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15539b.htm">Rt. Rev. Charles Walmesley</a>, Senior <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Bishop Carroll returned to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in triumph, 7 December, when he preached an appropriate and touching sermon in St. Peter's church. Troubles in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> required him soon to go thither, where he removed much prejudice.

<p>In common with their fellow-citizens, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> hailed with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the election of George Washington as first president under the new Constitution. Before the inauguration Bishop Carroll, on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, united with the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> (Charles Carrollton, and Daniel Carroll of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Dominick Lynch of New York, and Thomas FitzSimons of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>) in an address of congratulation, admirable for its sentiments of exalted patriotism ["An Address from the Roman Catholics of America to George Washington, Esq., President of the United States", London, 1790, fol.; reprint New York, 1865, facsimile and notes; see Shea, op. cit., 349-50, and ibid., the memorable and cordial reply of Washington (12 March, 1790) "To the Roman Catholics of the United States", in which he says: "I presume that your fellow-citizens will not forget the patriotic part which you took in the accomplishment of their Revolution, and the establishment of your Government, or the important assistance which they received from a nation in which the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is professed." The original of this reply is preserved in the Archives of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>]. It may not be out of place to quote here the noble words of Bishop Carroll himself, addressed (10 June, 1789) to a maligner of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: "Their blood flowed as freely (in proportion to their numbers) to cement the fabric of independence as that of any of their fellow-citizens. They concurred with perhaps greater unanimity than any other body of men in recommending and promoting that government from whose influence America anticipates all the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, peace, plenty, good order, and civil and religious liberty" (Brent, 97, see below; Shea, op. cit., 153).

<p>On 7 Nov., 1791, he held the First Synod of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, attended by twenty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of five nationalities. To train <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of three million square miles, Bishop Carroll had asked the Fathers of the Company of Saint Sulpice to come to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, where they arrived in 1791 and started the nucleus of St. Mary's College and Seminary. Bishop Carroll issued his first pastoral letter 28 March, 1792; very practical, yet tender, appealing for support for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by means of the offertory collections. In 1793 for the first time, Bishop Carroll conferred <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, the recipient being the <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Rev. Stephen Badin</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> within the limits of the original thirteen of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1795, he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Prince Demetrius Gallitzin</a> who was to add 6,000 converts to his flock. In 1798, Bishop Carroll won an interesting and important lawsuit, the famous Fromm Case (Shea, op. cit., 448-5), in which Judge Addison, President of the Court of Common Pleas of the Fifth Circuit of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, decided that "The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> has the sole episcopal authority over the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation within the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is subject to his inspection; and without authority from him no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> can exercise any pastoral function over any congregation within the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>." In 1792, says Shea (op. cit., 486-7) he interceded with Washington in regard to missions among the Indians; eventually the president recommended to Congress a civilizing and Christianizing policy among the Indians, one result of which was the acceptance of the services of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to whom a small yearly salary was allowed. After the death of Washington, Bishop Carroll "issued a circular to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (29 Dec., 1799) in regard to the celebration of the 22d of February as a day of mourning, giving directions for such action as would be in conformity with the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while attesting to the country the sorrow and regret experienced by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at the great national loss" (Shea, op. cit., 495). Having been invited by the unanimous resolution of Congress, in common with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> and congregations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, he preached a panegyric of the president in St. Peter's church in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 22 February, 1800, which was regarded by all who heard it, or read it in print (Baltimore, 1800), says Shea, (op. cit., 495), as one of the most masterly which were uttered on that day. Episcopal orders were conferred for the first time in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by Bishop Carroll on Bishop Neale, his coadjutor, with right of succession to the See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Plans for building his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> now occupied Bishop Carroll's mind, and on 7 July, 1806, he laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> on ground bought for $20,000, and the seventh design of the architect, B.H. Latrobe, was accepted.

<p>In 1808, Bishop Carroll became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, with suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> at New York, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and Bardstown. At a meeting held in Baltimore in 1810, Archbishop Carroll, with Bishop Neale and three of his suffragans, drew up some important regulations for the welfare and direction of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people (See <a href="../cathen/02239a.htm">PROVINCIAL COUNCILS OF BALTIMORE</a>). Owing to ill-health Archbishop Carroll had to decline the proffered <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of laying the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of Washington's Monument in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in the autumn of 1815. His end was now approaching. To a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister who said to the dying <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> that his hopes were now directed to another world, Archbishop Carroll replied: "Sir, my hopes have been always fixed on the Cross of Christ". A short while after he said, "Of those things that give me most consolation at the present moment, one is that I have always been attached to the practice of <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary</a>; that I have established it among the people under my care, and placed my diocese under her protection." On 22 November he received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, after which he made a touching discourse to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> present. "The whole population of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>", said a letter from a relative, were "constantly calling to inquire about, and to urge permission to see him." The funeral Mass was offered in St. Peter's pro-Cathedral and the body temporarily laid in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Mary's Seminary till 1824, when the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> was ready for the deposit it still guards.

<p>"Archbishop Carroll, though of low stature, had a commanding and dignified appearance", wrote the <a href="../cathen/15611a.htm">Rev. Dr. C. I. White</a>. "The configuration of his head, his whole mein, bespoke the metropolite. . . . He wrote them (Latin, Italian and French) not less readily and tersely than his own. He mingled often in gay <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, relished the festivities of polished life, and the familiar intercourse of both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> denomination. He was wholly free from guile, uniformly frank, generous and placable; he reprobated all intolerance. . . . He ranked and voted with the Federalist party. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> republicanism. His manners were mild, impressive and urbane."

<p>A Baltimore paper of the day said of the burial: "We have never witnessed a funeral procession where so many of eminent respectability and standing among us followed the train of mourners. Distinctions of rank, of wealth, of religious opinion were laid aside in the great testimony of respect to the memory of the man." Another Baltimore paper said: "In him religion assumed its most attractive and amiable form, and his character conciliated for the body over which he presided, respect and consideration from the liberal, the enlightened of all ranks and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>; for they saw that his life accorded with the benign doctrines of that religion which he professed. In controversy he was temperate yet compelling, considerate yet uncompromising.

<p>Brent says he had "sound judgment, real <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and pre-eminent talents". "The discourses from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, and the pastoral letters of Archbishop Carroll were alike distinguished for their unction and classical taste. His voice being naturally feeble, the exertions which he made to be distinctly heard from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> rendered his elocution less agreeable there than in other situations requiring less force of lungs. His colloquial powers and resources were great and rich, and his kind and benignant feelings always prompted him to apply them to the best of advantage. There was an irresistible charm and elegance indeed in his conversations."

<p>The archives of the Baltimore <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contain the original <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> making Father Carroll Superior of the Missions in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and erecting the See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and appointing Bishop Carroll, copies of the Briefs raising Baltimore to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> and conferring the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on Bishop Carroll, also very many of his official and private letters, etc.
