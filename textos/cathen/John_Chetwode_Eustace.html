<h1>John Chetwode Eustace</h1>  

<p>Antiquary, b. in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, c. 1762; d. at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1 Aug., 1815. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was English, his mother being one of the Chetwodes of Cheshire. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Sedgley Park School, and after 1774 at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house, St. Gregory's, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douay</a>. He did not become a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> though he always retained an attachment to the order, but went to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> where he taught rhetoric at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a> college, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He never had much sympathy for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and, having given some offence there, returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to assist Dr. Collins in his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Southall Park. From there he went to be <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Sir William Jerningham at Costessey. In 1802 he travelled through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with three pupils, John Cust (afterwards Lord Brownlow), Robert Rushbroke, and Philip Roche. During these travels he wrote a journal which subsequently became celebrated in his "Classical Tour". In 1805 he resided in Jesus College, Cambridge, as tutor to George Petre. This was a most unusual position for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Eustace's intercourse with leading members of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> led to his being charged with indifferentism. <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Dr. Milner</a>, then <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, charged him with laying aside "the distinctive worship of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in compliment, as he professed, to the liberality of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, with whom he associated" and with permitting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under his care to attend <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> services. "This conduct", wrote the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "was so <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> and offensive to real <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that I was called upon by my brethren to use every means in my power to put a stop to it." On the other hand, an intimate friend says, "he never for a moment lost sight of his sacred character or its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>" (Gentleman's Magazine, see below). When Petre left Cambridge, Eustace accompanied him on another tour to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and Malta. In 1813 the publication of his "Classical Tour" obtained for him sudden celebrity, and he became a prominent figure in literary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, Burke being one of his chief friends. A short tour in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1814, led to his "Letter from Paris", and in 1815 he travelled again to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to collect fresh materials, but he was seized with malaria at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and died there. Before death he bitterly lamented the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> tendency of certain passages in his writings. His works were: "A Political Catechism adapted to the present Moment" (1810); "An Answer to the Charge delivered by the Bishop of Lincoln to the Clergy of that Diocese at the Triennial Visitation in 1812"; "A Tour through Italy" (London, 1813, 2n ed., 1814); "A Classical Tour through Italy", 3d edition of the previous work, revised and enlarged (1815). A seventh edition of it appeared in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1841. It was also reprinted at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1837 in a series "Collections of Ancient and Modern English Authors", and "The Proofs of Christianity" (1814). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of his course of rhetoric, never published, is at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a>.
