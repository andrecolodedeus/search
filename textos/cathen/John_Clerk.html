<h1>John Clerk</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 3 January, 1541. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> (<a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B. A.</a>, 1499; M.A., 1502) and Bologna, where he became Doctor of Laws. When he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he attached himself to <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, and much preferment followed. He became Rector of Hothfield, Kent, 1508; Master of the Maison Dieu at Dover, 1509; Rector of Portishead (Somerset) 1513; Ivychurch (Kent), West Tarring (Sussex), and Charlton, all in 1514; South Molton (Devonshire) and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Colohester, 1519; Dean of <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a> and judge in the Court of Star Chamber, 1519. He was also Dean of the King's Chapel. He was useful in diplomatic commissions both to <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> and the king. In 1521 he was appointed ambassador to the Papal Court, in which capacity he presented King Henry's book against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in full consistory. He acted as <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> agent in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> on the death of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to be appointed Master of the Rolls in October, 1522, which office he held till 9 October, 1523. When <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> resigned the See of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>, in 1523, Clerk was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his stead. As bishop-elect he went on another political embassy to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, 6 December, 1523. He remained in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for two years and once more unsuccessfully represented <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> interests at the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> in which <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in November, 1525, but was so useful as a diplomatic agent that he was never long in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by his two suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. When the question of the royal <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> was raised Clerk was appointed as one of the queen's counsellors, but <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> persuaded him to agree on her behalf that she should withdraw from proceedings at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Afterwards he joined in pronouncing sentence of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, and is believed to have assisted Cranmer in works on the supremacy and the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. His last embassy was in 1540, to the Duke of Cleves, to explain the king's <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of Anne of Cleves. On his return he was taken ill at Dunkirk, not without suspicion of poison, but he managed to reach <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, though only to die. He lies buried at St. Botolph's, Aldgate, not at Dunkirk, as sometimes stated.

<p>Clerk wrote "Oratio pro Henrico VIII apud Leonem pontif. Max. in exhibitione operis regii contra Lutherum in consistonio habitam" (London, 1541), translated into English by T.W. (<a href="../cathen/15552a.htm">Thomas Warde</a>?), 1687.
