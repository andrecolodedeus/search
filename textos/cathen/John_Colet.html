<h1>John Colet</h1>  

<p>Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral and founder of St. Paul's School, London; b. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1467; d. there 18 Sept., 1519. He was the eldest son of Sir Henry Colet, twice Lord Mayor of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Having finished his schooling in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, but no particulars of his life there have been preserved, not even the name of his college. While at Oxford he determined to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and even before <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> obtained through <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> influence much preferment, including the livings of St. Mary Dennington, Suffolk, <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, Stepney, and the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the counties of Huntingdon, Northamptos, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and Norfolk. In 1493 he began a tour through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, studying as he went and acquiring that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the new learning which marked his after-life. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1496, he prepared for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and became <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on 17 Dec., 1497, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 25 March, 1497-8. He lectured at Oxford on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>, introducing a new treatment by abandoning the purely textual commentary then usual, in favour of a study of the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and of the text as a whole. In 1498 he met <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, with whom he immediately became intimate, arousing in him especially a distrust of the later <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a>. Colet's lectures on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> continued for five years, until in 1504 he was made Dean of St. Paul's proceeding D.D before he left Oxford. In <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> he became the intimate friend and <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a> of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>. At the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in 1505 he inherited a fortune, which he devoted to public purposes. His administration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was vigorous, and in 1509 he began the foundation of the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with which his name will ever be associated. The cost of the buildings and endowments is estimated at forty thousand pounds in present value. The object was to provide a sound <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Greek was to be at least of equal importance with Latin. William Lilly was the first head master, but Colet exercised a close personal supervision over the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, even composing some of the textbooks. In 1512 he was accused of advanced views and was in difficulties with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but on the trial <a href="../cathen/15554a.htm">Archbishop Warham</a> dismissed the charges as frivolous. It may well be that Colet, irritated by obvious abuses and not seeing how far the reaction would go, used language on certain points which in the light of after-events is regrettable, but there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to his own <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and devotion. In 1518 he completed the revised <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. At his death the following year he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Paul's Cathedral. His <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> remained on its original site until 1884, when it was removed to Hammersmith.

<p>Colet's works are: "Convocation Sermon of 1512"; "A righte fruitfull admonition concerning the order of a good Christian man's life" (1534); "Joannis Coleti Theologi olim Decani Divi Pauli Aeditio" (1527 and often reprinted), the original of almost all Latin Grammars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; "Opus de Sacramentis Ecclesiae" (1867), which with the following treatises, long preserved in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, was finally edited by the Rev. J. H.  Lupton, sur-master of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; two treatises on the "Hierarchies" of Dionysius (1869); "An Exposition of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans" (1873); "An Exposition of St. Paul's first Epistle to the Corinthians" (1874); "Letters to Radulphus" on the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> account of the Creation, and some minor works (1876); "Statutes of St. Paul's School" (often reprinted). <a href="../cathen/12120a.htm">Pitts</a> (de Ang. Scriptoribus, Paris, 1619) gives several additional works by Colet, none of which are extant. Many of his letters are in the works of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The account of Colet by Erasmus in "Epistolae" (Leyden, III, cccxxxv, tr. LUPTON (London, 1883), was the foundation of most of his biographies published before the end of the seventeenth century. Since then there have been several lives published, none by a Catholic writer.-KNIGHT, "Life of John Colet" (London, 1724; republished Oxford, 1823; written with strong Protestant bias); SEEBOHM, "Oxford Reformers: Colet, Erasmus and More" (London, 1867); LUPTON, "Life of John Colet" (London, 1887). For a bibliography see LUPTON, "Introduction to Colet's Letters to Radulphus"; GARDINER, "Register of St. Paul's School" (London, 1884); LEE in "Dict. Nat. Biog." (London, 1887), XI, 321-328, with account of various Colet MSS. Still existing.</p></div>
