<h1>John Colgan</h1>  

<p>Hagiographer and historian, b. in County Donegal, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, about the beginning of the seventeenth century; d. probably in 1657. Having joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> he was sent to study in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> College of St. Anthony of Padua in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Here he is said to have acted as professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for some time, but he soon forsook the professorial chair in order to devote himself to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> studies for which that college is justly famous. <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Father Hugh Ward</a> (d. 1635) had projected a complete history of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and for this purpose had sent some of his brethren, notably Michael O'Clery, to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to collect materials. <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Ward</a> died before he could make any progress in his work, but the materials that had been gathered remained. Colgan, being a competent master of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> language, had thus ready at hand a collection of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> unequalled in the department of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiology</a>. He undertook a great work, to be published in six volumes, dealing with the whole range of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> and antiquities. In 1645 he published at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> the third volume of this series (Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae, etc.), containing the lives of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose feasts occur in the calendar for the months of January, February, and March. The lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose feasts occur in the succeeding months were to have been published in the last three volumes of the series. <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, in his "Annales Minorum", informs us that the volume dealing with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> for April, May, and June was in the press at Colgan's death; this seems incorrect, since, if the work had been so far advanced, it would have been published by some one of the many competent colleagues who assisted Colgan.

<p>The second volume of the series, entitled "Trias Thaumaturga", etc., appeared at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1647. It deals with the three great national <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, Brigid, and Columbcille. In it are contained seven of the ancient lives of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, five of St. Columba, and six of St. Brigid. For a long time the "Trias Thaumaturga" was nearly the only source of information on <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, and even since the Whitley Stokes edition of the "Vita Tripartita" (Rolls Series), Colgan's work cannot be dispensed with. It should be noted that Colgan gives a Latin version of the "Vita Tripartita" which represents a different text from that edited by Stokes; Colgan's <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> seems to have entirely disappeared. Besides the "Lives" in the "Trias Thaumaturga", there are also contained in this volume many valuable "Appendices", dealing with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antiquities of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and critical and topographical notes, which, though not always correct, are of invaluable assistance to the student. In 1655 he published at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> a life of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, in which he undertook to prove that this great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> doctor was born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and not in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, as was then frequently asserted. In the "Bibliotheca Franciscana" Colgan is said to have died in 1647, but this is evidently a mistake, as a note in his work on <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> proves clearly that he was alive in 1655.

<p>Colgan's work on <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiology</a> is of undoubted value. Though unfortunately of very weak constitution, he was a man of great ability and industry, and with a sound critical sense. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> language enabled him to turn to good account the vast collection of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (now unfortunately for the greater part lost) which had been collected at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Ward</a>, while his acquaintance with the traditions existing among the native <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> of his time, about the various names of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and places, gave him an advantage over writers of the present day. It must be remembered, however, that Colgan, though a fluent <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> speaker, had not, and from the nature of things could not have, a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the grammatical forms of Old and Middle <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. Hence his judgments about the dating of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and about the meaning of certain difficult expressions ought not to be put forward as irreversible. In other words, Colgan should be judged by the criteria of his time; from this point of view his work on the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is unequalled. But his opinions are not decisive evidences of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at the present day, especially when pitted against the view of the most skilled students of Old and Middle <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> grammar and texts. His principal works are: "Acta Sanctorum veteris et majoris Scotix seu Hibernix, Sanctorum Insulx, partim ex variis per Europam manuscript Codicibus exscripta, partim ex antiquis monumentis et probatis Auctoribus eruta et congesta; omnia Notis et Appendicibus illustrata. Tomus primus qui de Sacris Hibernix Antiquitatibus est tertius, Januarium, Februarium et Martium complectens" (Louvain, 1645); "Triadis Thaumaturgx, seu Divorum Patricci Columbx et Brigidx, trium Veteris et Majoris Scotix, seu Hibernix, Sanctorum Insulx, communium Patronorum Acta, Tomus Secundus Sacrarum ejusdem Insulx Antiquitatum" (Louvain, 1647); "Tractatus de Vita, Patria, Scriptis Johannis Scoti, Doctoris Subtilis" (Antwerp, 1655). Besides these he left in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> "De Apostolatu Hibernorum inter exteras Gentes cum Dice Alphabetico de exteris santis" (852 pages); "De Sanctis in Anglia, Britannia, Aremorica, in reliqua Gallia, in Belgio" (1068 pages); "De Sanctis in Lotharingia et Burgundia, in Germania ad senestram et dexteram Rheni, in Italia" (920 pages). Some of these invaluable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, though eagerly sought for, have not yet been traced (see Gilbert, National <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, London, 1884; or Doherty, op. cit. below, 81-82).
