<h1>John Dobree Dalgairns</h1>  

<p>(In religion F<font size=-2>ATHER</font> B<font size=-2>ERNARD</font>).

<p>Born in the island of Guernsey, 21 Oct., 1818; d. 6 April, 1876, at St. George's Retreat, Burgess Hill, near Brighton, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He matriculated at <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> college, Oxford, 1836, and took a second class in <em>literis humanioribus,</em> 1839. Already an ardent follower of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, he had written (1838) to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> "Univers" a letter signed "jeune membre de l'Universit&eacute;", on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement then spreading in the English Church, which elicited a correspondence with <a href="../cathen/05113a.htm">Father Dominic the Passionist</a>. In 1842 he joined <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> at Littlemore; whigthere he contributed several articles to the "British Critic" and wrote the Lives of <a href="../cathen/14290d.htm">St. Stephen Harding</a>, St. Gilbert, St. Helier, <a href="../cathen/01172b.htm">St. &AElig;lred</a>, and others for the series of early English <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> then being edited by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. The grasp of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> history displayed in these lives, and their picturesque setting evoked high praise even from such a strong <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as Dean Milman. Dalgairns's life, work, and studies had drawn him ever closer to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in September, 1845, he was received into it by his former correspondent, Father Dominic. He then repaired to the Abb&eacute; Jovain, canon of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, whose acquaintance he had made in 1841 when the abb&eacute; was on a visit to Oxford; in December, 1846, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>. A worthless French translation of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> "Essay on Development" was described by Dalgairns in the "Univers", 10 Jan., 1847, as "un amas inintelligible de paroles sans id&eacute;es, et dans lequel en plusieurs endroits le traducteur avait donn&eacute; une apparence d'h&eacute;r&eacute;sie aux phrases de l'auteur", words strangely prophetic of the use made by certain <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">"Modernist"</a> writers of the same work.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1847, he joined <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and entered the new English Oratorian <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Santa Croce. As an Oratorian he was successively at Maryvale, St. Wilfrid's, Staffordshire, King William Street, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1849), Birmingham (1853), and South Kensington, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1856), where he was elected superior on Father Faber's death, September, 1863. As a preacher he was second only to Faber and as a confessor his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of languages attracted a large circle of penitents, among whom was Queen Marie-Am&eacute;lie, wife of Louis Philippe. In 1869 he became a member of the Metaphysical Society which was then being formed. With <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> and <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, Dalgairns had to defend <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> against scientific <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostics</a> like Huxley and Tyndall, literary <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostics</a> such as Morley and Leslie Stephen, Thompson the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> James Martineau, and others of every shade of creed or of no creed. Speaking of these debates Thompson says, "he was more struck by the metaphysical ability of Father Dalgairns and Mr. James Martineau than any of the other debaters". Hutton, then editor of "The Spectator," says of Dalgairns and his coreligionists, "there was in their countenance a blending of genuine <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and genuine thankfulness for the authority on which they had anchored themselves and a sense of the redundance of their provisions for the spiritual life, of which almost all the other members seemed to feel they had but a bare and scanty pasturage". His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy, and his acquaintance with the writings of German scientists enabled him to meet Huxley successfully on his own grounds. But the attendance at the meetings of the Society broke down Dalgairns's health. He was struck with paralysis, and he died after a year's lingering <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> illness. Hutton describes him as "a man of singular sweetness and openness of character with something of a French type of playfulness of expression". His best known works are "The Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus" (London, 1853); "The Holy Communion" (Dublin, 1861); "The German Mystics of the Fourteenth Century" (London, 1858).
