<h1>John Dubois</h1>  

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York, educator and missionary, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 August, 1764; d. in New York, 20 December, 1842. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at home until he was prepared to enter the Coll&eacute;ge Louis-le-Grand, where he had for fellow-students Robespierre and Desmoulins. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the Oratorian Seminary of St-Magloire, 22 Sept., 1787, by Archbishop de Juign&eacute;, of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he was appointed an assistant to the <em>cur&eacute;</em> of St-Sulpice, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Sisters of Charity (Hospice des Petites Maisons). Forced in May, 1791, by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he escaped in disguise to America, and landed at Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, Aug., 1791, bearing commendatory letters from the Marquis de Lafayette to James Monroe, the Randolphs, Lees, Beverlys, and Patrick Henry. He was cordially received, resided for some time in the house of Mr. Monroe, received instruction in English from Patrick Henry, and even celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the State House at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>. In 1794 he became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Frederick where he built the first church and ministered to Western <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Virginia. His career as an educator began in 1808, when, joining the Society of St-Sulpice, he withdrew from the Frederick mission and opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> on the mountain, at Emmitsburg, as a <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>. This he soon discovered impracticable, and, in its place, founded there the present Mt. St. Mary's College. Father Dubois was also of invaluable assistance, material and spiritual, to Mother Seton, foundress of the American Sisters of Charity, when she established (1809) a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of her community a short distance from the college.

<p>On the death of the <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Rt. Rev. John Connolly</a>, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York, 6 Feb., 1825, Father Dubois was chosen his successor and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York by Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 29 Oct., 1826. Three days later he took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which covered the whole <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, and half the <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">State of New Jersey</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 150,000, eighteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and some twelve churches. A visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> revealing the pressing need of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for aid in 1829, and obtained substantial help from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>. He made three unsuccessful attempts to establish a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Fire destroyed one when just completed at Nyack; another projected on a site chosen in Brooklyn was never begun; and a third in Lafargeville, in the northern part of the State, was closed because too remote and inaccessible. Another serious problem confronted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the lay trustee System controlling the churches. On one occasion, when the trustees of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> threatened to withhold his salary, he made this memorable reply "I am an old man, and do not need much. I can live in a basement or in a garret. But whether I come up from the basement or down from the garret, I shall still be your Bishop" (see <a href="../cathen/15071b.htm">TRUSTEEISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK</a>). Enfeebled by age and hard work, he asked for a coadjutor, the diocese having grown to include 38 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 12 stations, and 40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the Rev. John Hughes of Philadelphia was appointed <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02329b.htm">Basilinopolis</a> and coadjutor of New York in 1837. Bishop Dubois's infirmities increasing, Bishop Hughes was made administrator in 1839, and the old <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> passed the last days of a life of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> in retirement. His body rests in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Patrick's old Cathedral, New York.
