<h1>John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, Baron Acton</h1>  

<p>Baron Acton, Professor of Modern History at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, 1895-1902, born at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 10 January, 1834, Where his father, Sir Richard Acton, held an important diplomatic appointment; died at <a href="../cathen/14471b.htm">Tegernsee</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 19 June, 1902.

<p>His mother was the heiress of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the Dalbergs. The Actons, though of an old English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> stock, had long been naturalized in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where Lord Acton's grandfather had been prime minister. The future historian was thus in an extraordinary degree cosmopolitan, and much of his exceptional mastery of historical literature may be ascribed to the fact that the principal languages of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were as familiar to him as his native tongue. In 1843 the boy was sent to Oscott College, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, where Doctor, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Nicholas Wiseman</a> was then president. After five years spent at Oscott, Acton complete his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, as the pupil of the celebrated historian <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. With <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> he visited <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and both there and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> lived on terms of intimacy with the most eminent historical scholars of the day. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, however, in 1859, to settle upon the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estate of Aldenham in Shropshire, he entered parliament as member for an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> constituency, and retained his seat for six years, voting with the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, but taking little part in the debates. In the meantime he devoted himself to literary work, and upon <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> retirement, in 1859, succeeded him in the editorship of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical called "The Rambler", which, after 1862, was transformed into a quarterly under the title of "The Home and Foreign Review". The ultra liberal tone of this journal gave offence to <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and Acton eventually judged it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to discontinue its publication, in April, 1864, when he wrote, concerning certain tenets of his which had been disapproved of, that "the principles had not ceased to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nor the authority which censured them to be legitimate, because the two were in contradiction." The publication of the "Syllabus" by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1864 tended to alienate Acton still further from Ultramontane counsels. He had in the meantime become very intimate with Mr. Gladstone, by whom he was recommended for a peerage in 1869, and at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> Lord Acton went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the express object of organizing a party of resistance to the proposed definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, when it came, seems to have had the effect of permanently embittering Acton's feelings towards Roman authority, but he did not, like his friend <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, formally sever his connection with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Indeed in his later years at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> he regularly attended Mass, and he received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, at <a href="../cathen/14471b.htm">Tegernsee</a>, on his death-bed. The Cambridge Professorship of Modern History was offered to him by Lord Roseberry in 1895, and, besides the lectures which he delivered there, he conceived and partly organized the "Cambridge Modern History", the first volume of which was only to see the light after his death. Lord Acton never produced anything which deserves to be called a book, but he wrote a good many reviews and occasionally an article or a lecture. As an historian he was probably more remarkable for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of detail than for judgment or <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>. The "Letters of Quirinus," published in the Allgemeine Zeitung", at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and attributed to Lord Acton, as well as other letters addressed to the "Times", in November, 1874, show a mind much warped against the Roman system. The "Letters to Mrs. Drew" (Mr. Gladstone's daughter), which were printed by Mr. Herbert Paul in 1903, are brilliant but often bitter. A pleasanter impression is given by another collection of Lord Acton's private letters (published 1906) under the editorship of Abbot Gasquet. Some of Acton's best work was contributed to the "English Historical Review". His article on "German Schools of History", in the first volume, and on "D&ouml;llinger's Historical Work", in the fifth, deserve particular mention.
