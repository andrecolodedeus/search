<h1>John Floyd</h1>  

<p>English missionary, wrote under the names Flud, Daniel &agrave; Jesu, Hermannus Loemelius, George White, Annosus Fidelis Verimentanus, and under the initials J. R. Some of his works have been <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed to Robert Jennison, S.J. He was b. in Cambridgeshire in 1572; d. at St.-Omer, 16 Sept. 1649. he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Jesuit College at Eu, then at the English College at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (17 March, 1588) and finally the English College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1590), where he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 1 Nov., 1592. Nothing is known about his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but in 1606 he was a missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. On 6 April in that year he was arrested at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> while attempting to visit <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Ven. Edward Oldcorne</a> who was to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> next day. Having been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for twelve months he, with forty-six other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, was banished for life. He then spent four years teaching at St.-Omer, though <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a> (Records, IV, 238), is mistaken in supposing he published any controversial works at that time. On 31 July, 1609, he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> of the four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and soon after returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he laboured on the mission for many years, being often captured, but effecting his escape by buying off the pursuivants. In 1612 he published his first work, "The Overthrow of the Protestant Pulpit Babels", in which he replied to Crawshaw's "Jesuit Gospel". He was in return answered by Sir Edward Hoby in his "A Counter-Snarl for Ishmael Rabshakeh a Cycropedian Lycaonite, being an answer to a Roman Catholic who writes himself J. R." Father Floyd countered in 1614 with "Purgatorie's Triumph over Hell, maugre the barking of Cerberus in Syr Edward Hobyes Counter Snarle". This controversy closed with Hoby's rejoinder, "A Curry-comb for a Cox-combe", published in 1615. Father Floyd next turned his attention to Marc' Antonio de Dominis, formerly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Spilatro, who had apostasized and become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> dean of <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a>. Against him Father Floyd wrote four works: "Synopsis Apostasi&aelig; Marci Antonii de Dominis, olim Archepiscopi Spalatensis, nunc Apostat&aelig;, ex ipsiusmet libro delineata" (Antwerp 1617). It was translated into English by Father Henry Hawkins, S.J., in 1617, and again by <a href="../cathen/06101c.htm">Dr. John Fletcher</a> in 1828. "Hypocrisis Marci Antonii de Dominis detecta sui censura in ejus libros de Republic&acirc; Ecclesiastic&acirc;" (Antwerp, 1620); "Censura ex Librorum X de Republic&acirc; Ecclesiastic&acirc; Marci Antonii de Dominis" (Antwerp 1620, Cologne, 1621); "Monarchi&aelig; Ecclesiastic&aelig; ex scriptus M. Antonii de Dominis Archepiscopi Spalatensis Demonstratio, duobus libri comprehensa" (Cologne, 1622). All four works appeared under the signature <em>Fidelis Annosus Verimentanus</em>.

<p>In 1620, Floyd published "God and the King", a translation of a work on loyalty, and in the following year a translation of Augustine's "Meditations". In 1623 he was living in Fleet Street (Gee's "Foot out of the Snare") and in the same year he wrote "A word of comfort or a discourse concerning the late lamentable accident of a fall of a room at a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Sermon in the Blackfriars of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, wherewith about four-score <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were oppressed"; also a translation of Molina "On the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>". In 1625 he published "An Answer to Francis White's reply to Mr. Fischer's answer to the Nine Articles offered by King James to Father John Fischer". In 1629 Fr. Floyd played a leading part in the controversy between <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and seculars on the desirability of having a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resident in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Bishop Richard Smith, whose presence was regarded by some as a source of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, had in fact left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was never able to return, but the situation gave rise to acrimonious discussion. Father Floyd's works were "An Apology for the Holy See Apostolick's Proceedings for the Government of the Catholicks of England during the time of persecution" (Rouen, 1630; enlarged Lat. ed., Cologne, 1631): and "Hermanni Loemelii Antverpiensis Spongia qua diluuntur Calumni&aelig; nomine Facultatis Parisiensis imposit&aelig; libro qui inscribitur Apologia" etc. (St-Omer, 1631). Both of these works were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and in 1633 <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> stopped the controversy and suppressed all writings on the subject. His other works are "A Paire of Spectacles for Sir Humphrey Linde to see his way withal" (1631); "The Church Conquerant over Human Wit" (1638); "The Totall Sum" (1638); "The Imposture of Puritan Piety" (1638). He left two unpublished works: "Vita Brunehildis Francorum Regin&aelig;" and a "Treatise on Holy Pictures". Father Floyd spent the last years of his life teaching philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at St-Omer's.
