<h1>John Francis Bentley</h1>  

<p>English architect, b. at Doncaster, Yorkshire, in 1839; d. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, February, 1902. From early days he exhibited a strong inclination towards the profession in which he was to make so great a mark. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were not in sympathy with him, so, at the age of sixteen, he placed himself <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> with the Clerk of the Works at Loversall Church. In 1855 he began his probation with Sharpe, Stewart &amp; Co., of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, going to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, in 1858, where he was associated with <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> &amp; Hannan and then with Henry Clutton. He started for himself in 1868. He was a firm believer in the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> principles and methods of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, giving to every detail in his work, from foundation to furniture, his personal attention. He was an apt modeller and had tried his hand with success at stone carving. As a draughtsman, and especially as a colourist, he was very successful, his designs for marble and metal work, jewellery, <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">heraldic</a> decorations being of great beauty.

<p>His first important commission was from <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Hammersmith, and amongst his buildings should be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Rood, at Watford; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, at Braintree; the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Beaumont College, Old Windsor; St. Anne's Cathedral, Leeds; and St. Mary's, Cadogan Place, Chelsea. He was also responsible for the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, font, and <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a> at St. Francis, Notting Hill; the reredos and altar at St. Charles, Ogle Street, Marylebone, sedilia and Sacred Heart <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the church of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> at Farm Street; and the decoration at Carlton Towers. In 1894, he received his commission to build the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and at once started for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to make a careful study of the various great <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> work at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. He devoted himself with great concentration to this, his life memorial, producing the most remarkable <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> building erected in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and receiving high praise all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> on his extraordinary success.

<p>He was a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of brusque, reserved manner, but kind and friendly to those who really <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him. He had the strongest dislike to the preparation of show drawings and to the system of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> competition and, being a man wholly lacking in self-assertion, and reticent in conversation, was never as well known in general circles as he deserved to be. His great characteristics as an architect were his careful attention to detail, his solicitude that all the fittings should be in perfect harmony with the building, and the sparing use he made of iron. He was awarded the gold medal of the Institute of Architects in February, 1902, but never received it, as on the 1st of March he was seized with paralysis and died the following morning. He was present at the trial of acoustic qualities made in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but was not spared to see its formal opening. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at Mortlake.
