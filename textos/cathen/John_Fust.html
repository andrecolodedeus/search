<h1>John Fust</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> FAUST.)

<p>A partner of <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a> in promoting the art of printing, d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> about 1466. He belonged to a wealthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, but very little is known of his early life. In 1450 he became a partner of <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a> in the establishment of a printing plant at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Fust furnishing the capital and taking a mortgage on the tools and materials as security. The partners carried on the business on several years, but the partnership was dissolved in 1455, when Fust brought suit against <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a> for the money that he had advanced and obtained possession of the printing apparatus. The business was then continued by Fust with his son-in-law, Peter Sch&ouml;ffer, of Gernsheim, as partner. In 1462, when <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> was sacked Fust's workmen were scattered, and they carried with them to various countries the printing process which had been guarded as a secret in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Fust continued the business, however, until 1466, when he is thought to have gone to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and to have died there of the plague. Among the books that were issued from the press of Fust and <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a> the best known is the magnificent Latin "Bible of forty-two lines" (see Illustration s.v. <a href="../cathen/05286a.htm">EDITIONS OF THE BIBLE</a>), so called because it was printed forty-two lines to the page. It is known also as the Mazarin Bible, because the first known copy of it was discovered in <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin's</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It is a fine specimen of the early printer's art. They also printed an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> granted by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> to the King of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (1454-5). In partnership with Sch&ouml;ffer Fust Published a <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> (1457), the first printed book with a complete date; the "Rationale Divinorum Officiorum" of Durandus (1459); and Cicero's "De Officiis" (1465), the first printed edition of a classical author. Several other books that were printed by Fust and his partners are still extant, some of them very beautiful in their execution.
