<h1>John Gropper</h1>  

<p>An eminent jurist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 24 Feb., 1503, at Soest, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 March, 1559. On the completion of his classical studies in his native place, he entered at the age of fourteen the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a> to take up the study of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, and there on 7 Nov., 1525, received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law. The following year he received the office of official sealer in the electoral municipality of Cologne. The religious questions of the day, consequent upon the doctrines of the reformers, now led him to apply himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and in a short time he had acquired, "privately and without a master", such an extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> that he became known as the "os cleri Coloniensis". In 1522, he was made canon at Xanten, and then successively dean, canon, and finally <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and dean of Soest. His learning, eloquence, and charity towards the poor elicited admiration from friends and enemies. He supported Archbishop Hermann V of Wied in the reorganization and adjustment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in the electoral province, and was the first to determine the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopate</a> (Jurisdictionis ecclesiasticae archiepiscopalis Curiae Coloniensis reformatio, Cologne, 1529). In 1530 he accompanied the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as assistant counsellor to the Diet of Augsbug, where, with Arnold of Wesel and Bernard of Hagen, he came into closer relationship with <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>. To combat more effectually the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> decided upon a Provincial synod to be held in Cologne in 1536, and, to insure the best possible results, entrusted the preparation of the decrees to Gropper. The latter performed the task with great credit to himself, and formulated the old canonical regulations regarding the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> with such clearness and precision that the synod approved his proposals with but slight changes and requested him to compose an enchiridion which would contain at once the canons ard a commentary on them (Institutio compendiaria doctrinae christianae, Cologne, 1538). Other editions appeared simply under the title "Enchiridion" (Paris, 1541, 1550). In it the author gives an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, the Seven Sacraments, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. Notwithstanding the fact however that the work was placed on the index of prohibited books by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, because of the author's adoption of a twofold formal cause of justification, namely the "justitia inhaerens" and the "justitia imputata", it was nevertheless received by many with enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. It was sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Cologne, and Cardinals <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, and Morone looked upon it as particularly adapted to bring about a reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the Congress of Hagenau, in 1540, Gropper, at the instance of Philip, Landgrave of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, entered into conciliatory negotiations with <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, which were continued at Worms and at the religious discussions in <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>; but, while an apparent union was effected on the questions of grace and justification, in regard to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Eucharist no reconciliation was attempted. While Gropper no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> accomplished much good by his opposition to the innovations of the reformers, it is but too evident that his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for union sometimes led him to sacrifice <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles.

<p>When, however, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> defined the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of justification, he at once submitted to its decision. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> himself gradually abandoned the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and allowed the new doctrines to be preached in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He engaged <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> and, later, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> to draw up plans for a complete reformation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> principles. In this critical moment Gropper published his "Antididagma seu christianae et catholicae religionis propuguatio" (Cologne, 1544), in which he vigorously defends the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and refutes the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the reformers, at the same time requesting the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. With this <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> complied on 16 April, 1546, and his successor in the electorate of Cologne appointed the coadjutor <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Adolph III of Schauenburg, who, with the assistance of Gropper, succeeded in expelling from the diocese the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers and restoring the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. In recompense for his services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Gropper Provost of Bonn. In 1561 he accompanied his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to the Council of Brent, where he assisted at numerous sessions and delivered the discourse, "De appellationum abusu" (Cologne, 1552). On 20 Jan., 1556, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of Santa Lucia in Silice. This <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he accepted with great reluctance; neither did he proceed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> till the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>-minded John Gebhard of Mansfeld was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1558. His death occurred at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself preached the funeral oration. Among Gropper's other publications may be mentioned: "Formula examinandi designatos seu praesentatos ad ecclesias parochiales" (Cologne, 1552); "Manuale pro administratione sacramentorum" etc. (Cologne, 1550); "Vonn Warer, Wesenlicher vnd Pleibender Gegenwertigkeit des Leybs vnd Bluts Christi nach beschener Consecration" (Cologne, 1548).
