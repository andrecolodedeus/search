<h1>John Holmes</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educator and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; born at Windsor, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, in 1799; died at <a href="../cathen/09360a.htm">Lorette</a>, near <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Quebec, Canada</a>, in 1852.

<p>After a few years' schooling at Dartmouth College, he left home for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, bent on prosecuting his studies and converting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. His own eyes were opened to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, which he embraced at Yamachiche, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, in 1817, where the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, Abb&eacute; Lecuyer, had housed and instructed him. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Montreal Seminary, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11069a.htm">Nicolet</a> College. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in 1823 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Drummondville, the centre during the four years of his ministry of a field of labour extending over a district now comprising fifteen or twenty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>He then went as professor to Quebec Seminary, which was to reap such benefit from his talents and devotedness. Abb&eacute; Holmes, a born pedagogue, infused new life into the antiquated curriculum, introducing Greek, English, and all the branches of experimental <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. His inventive genius and winning style lent a charm to all his teaching, especially that of geography. His "Trait&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie", first published in 1832, many times re-edited and even translated into English and German, is a model text-book. He first conceived the plan of a Catholic University, since realized in <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval</a>, the charter of which was signed shortly after his death.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was not limited to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In 1836, when the Legislature of Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> voted grants for the first normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the task of organizing and equipping these institutions was entrusted to Abb&eacute; Holmes.

<p>No patriot was more devoted to the country of his adoption. His experience in the eastern townships inspired him to promote colonization in that direction, so as to stem the tide of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> emigration beyond the border-line. He also foresaw the possibility of a commercial union of all the British provinces in North America, a plan afterwards more completely realized by the confederation in 1867.

<p>Abb&eacute; Holmes was an orator in the full sense of the word. His deep and varied <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, expressive mien and gesture, sonorous voice, and perfect mastery of the French tongue all combined to charm and convince the audiences that crowded the vast <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to overflowing, and produced on his hearers a life-long impression. His "Conf&eacute;rences de Notre-Dame" were first published in 1850. His friendly relations with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> soon reconciled them to his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. A brother and all his six sisters followed him into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
