<h1>John Hughes</h1>  

<p>Fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, born at Annaloghan, Co. Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 June, 1797 of Patrick Hughes and Margaret McKenna: died in New York, 3 January, 1864. His father, a farmer of limited means, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1816, and settled in Chambersberg, Pa. Johns's early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at Aligher, and later at Auchnacloy, near his native village. Though he felt called to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, circumstances did not permit him to continue his studies: being disinclined to farm life, he was placed with a friend of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to study horticulture. He followed his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to America in 1817, landed at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and soon after went to Chambersburg where he aided his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> for a year or more. His ardent desire to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> brought him in 1819 to Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg. Md., which he entered as an employee, being received a year later as a student. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> 15 October, 1826, by Bishop Conwell, in St. Joseph's Church, Philadelphia, he laboured first at St. Augustine's, Philadelphia, later at Bedford, Pa., finally returning to Philadelphia to become <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph's, and afterwards of St. Mary's whose trustees were in open revolt against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and were subdued by Father Hughes only when he built St. Joseph's church, 1832, then considered one of the finest in the country. Previous to this, in 1829, he founded St. John's Orphan Asylum. About this period he was engaged in a religious controversy with Rev. John A. Brekenridge, a distinguished <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, with the result that Father Hughes's remarkable ability attracted widespread attention and admiration. His name was mentioned for the vacant see of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and for the Coadjutorship of Philadelphia. On 7 Jan, 1838, however, Father Hughes was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basileopolis and Coadjutor of New York, by Bishop Dubois, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Mott Street, New York. In 1839 he became administrator-Apostolic of New York, and on the death of Bishop Dubois succeeded to the vacant see, 20 Dec. 1842. He was raised to the dignity of first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, 19 July, 1850, receiving the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> personally from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 April 1851.

<p>The abolition of trusteeism in New York marked the beginning of his episcopate. He confronted a critical <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> condition arising from differences between <a href="../cathen/05178b.htm">Bishop Dubois</a> and the lay trustees whose control of the church revenues was working injury to religion, and had encumbered the 10 churches then in the city with a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of $300,000, a crushing burden in those days. Bishop Hughes's in Philadelphia with trusteeism served him well in taking up the defense of Bishop Dubois. He appealed directly to the people, before whom he forcefully defended the Divine authority to govern granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and clearly exposed the viciousness of lay domination in administration of church matters. The people readily passed a resolution condemning the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> trustees who gave way to a new board well disposed to obey <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> convoked in 1841 the first Diocesan Synod of New York, which enacted timely legislation affecting spiritual matters, and advised for tenure and administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> wise regulations which placed the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the church in control of temporals as well as spirituals. His triumph over the trustee System would have been complete and final at the very outset had the trustees of St. Louis's church, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, been as prompt to submit as all others. Their attitude brought the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, as late as 1855, into a controversy with <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> Brooks, editor and state senator, who assailed in the Legislature the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> plan of holding <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Unfavorable legislation followed, but was soon repealed, and prepared the way for the present satisfactory religious corporation law of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>

<p>Returning from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, whither he had gone in 1839 to seek aid for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Bishop Hughes found his flock involved in a movement to modify the existing common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system, which, professing to be non-sectarian, was undermining, in fact, the religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> immediately placed himself at the head of the movement, and deemed it incumbent on him to oppose the Public School Society, a private corporation controlling the management of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the distribution of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> fund provided by the municipality. He based his objection to this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> on the ground that it violated a fundamental American principle, namely freedom of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could not accept any system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which ignored, undermined, or opposed the religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> dictated to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. After two years' unceasing contest, he finally brought about the overthrow of the Public School Society. He had hoped, and Governor Seward was kindly disposed, that the Legislature might be so truly American as to sanction and support <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Religious animosity <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> too bitter. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hopes were not realized. The establishment of the present public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system followed, which likewise, failing to satisfy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, led the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to lay the foundation, on a firm basis, of the existing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system in New York. An anti-Catholic outbreak of the "Native American" political party occurred in 1844, in Philadelphia, where churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were destroyed. A meeting of this party was announced to take place in New York City. Apprehensive that the result would be riot and bloodshed, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> called personally on the mayor of the city to prevent the meeting. Warning him of the consequences if any anti-Catholic outrage were attempted. He at the same time solemnly cautioned his flock against <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, but took measures to resist any attack against <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. His fearless determined attitude prevented the holding of the meeting and averted disturbance of the peace. Ten years later the <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">"Know-nothing"</a> faction became active. He again advised his people to keep aloof from the centres of trouble. He was deeply convinced that all such movements, being as anti-American as they were anti-Catholic, could not possible thrive in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.



<p>Few public men of his day possessed a more statesmanlike grasp of the genius of the American Republic. He had unbounded confidence in its institutions, when their very existence was precarious. He looked upon America as a land of promise opened by a beneficent Providence to the oppressed of the nations. No one would question his own abiding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his native soil; but he would not permit this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to make him lament as an exile of Erin when he might rejoice as an American citizen. Thus he taught his people. So far-seeing was he in this respect that he looked with disfavor upon national churches, lest they might perpetrate racial differences and foreign customs. All must be formed into a common people; and no influence could do this better for the American people, he contended, than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sent by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to teach all nations. Archbishop Hughes will ever rank among America's foremost citizens. His towering character, genius for government, and intense patriotism won for him the respect and often the admiration of his opponents, the esteem and even the lifelong friendship of distinguished statesmen. President Polk, through Secretary Buchanan, in 1846, proffered him a diplomatic mission to Mexico, which he was unable to accept. On invitation of John Quincy Adams, Stephen A. Douglas, and John C. Calhoun, he lectured before Congress in the Capitol, Washington, his topic being "Christianity, the Only Source of Moral Social and Political Regeneration". At the outbreak of the Civil War, although not an abolitionist, he boldly sustained the Union cause, and was in frequent communication with William H. Seward, Secretary of State, to whom he offered useful suggestions on the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. President Lincoln, in an autograph letter, expressed his appreciation of the counsel given. Secretary Seward, desiring to hold <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in a friendly attitude towards the Federal Government, entrusted the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> with an important mission to the court of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, who received him most graciously, and was dissuaded by him from recognizing the Confederacy. On this visit to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, wherever he went, he left nothing undone to create sympathy for the Union side. During the Draft Riots of 1863 in New York City, Governor Seymour invoked the aid of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to suppress disorder, to which invitation, though he was fatally broken in health, he willingly responded, addressing a large assemblage from the balcony of his residence.

<p>His loyalty to his adopted country was well balanced and finely adjusted to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and responsibilities of his sacred office. He exercised the strictest vigilance lest American liberty might engender liberal influence tending to minimize the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He unsparingly condemned those who, through fear of anti-Catholic feeling, were disposed to conciliate their opponents by seemingly harmless concessions. He was intolerant of the slightest modification or innovation in religion unless sanctioned by the Supreme Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He believed that the adherence to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be bold, fearless, outspoken and uncompromising in the extreme, and especially so in the face of opposition. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, exiled in 1848, and again threatened in 1860, found the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> one of his staunchest defenders of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Strong agencies of power and influence were conspiring against the temporal sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and this condition intimidated not a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> into a policy of silent and ineffective sympathy; others somewhat less timid favored action, but of a conservative character. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> approved of no such methods, and boldly proclaimed himself an uncompromising supporter of the Vicar of Christ and his lawful patrimony. By appeal, sermon, lecture, and pastoral letter he aroused his flock at home to unbounded enthusiasm, and stirred <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> abroad in a masterly vindication of the temporal independence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. He raised in 1860 the princely sum of $53,000, as an offering from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to the Holy Father; and his pastoral letter, circulated throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and translated in Italian, afforded solace to the afflicted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>.

<p>Conjointly with all this prominence and activity demanded by public and vital interests of Church and nation, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> followed faithfully and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> the exacting life of a hardworking missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the upbuilding of a rapidly growing diocese. In 1842 there were some forty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, fifty churches and 200,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered over his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, which embraced the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> and eastern part of <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>. Bishop McClosky, later the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, was Coadjutor of New York from 1844 to 1847. Albany and Buffalo were erected into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in 1847; Brooklyn and Newark in 1853. Besides these four separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> made up within the original territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of New York, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> before his death in 1864 ruled 150 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 85 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 3 colleges, 50 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and academies and over 400,000 people. He stated in 1858 that he had dedicated his 99th church. As <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, created in 1850, he presided over New York, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a> and all New England, with suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a> and <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>. The First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of New York was convened in September, 1854, after which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and he was present at the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a>.

<p>During his administration institutions of charity and higher learning grew apace with churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was moved in 1840 from Largerville to <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, where a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened a year later. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> assumed charge of it in 1846, but in 1855 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> withdrew the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> from <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, and in 1862 secured <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at Troy, New York, for the establishment of St. Joseph's Provincial Seminary. He also proved to be one of the warmest supporters of the North American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, projected by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1855, and successfully opened in 1859. To meet <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> needs he introduced into New York the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, the Sisters of Notre Dame, and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. Finding the Sisters of Charity of Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, who were labouring in New York, restricted by their rule to a limited field and refrained from undertaking certain <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> desired, he organized an independent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> community of Sisters of Charity, who today, are managing a variety of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, charitable, protective and industrial institutions, and form one of the most flourishing and successful sisterhoods in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Foreseeing the future greatness of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city, he planned the erection of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which would be commensurate with the importance of the city and See of New York, and would express in enduring stone the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his flock. He laid the cornerstone of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fifth Avenue, 15 August 1858; this lofty and inspiring pile stands as a monument to his genius and prevision.

<p>He lived and passed away amid stirring times; it was providential for church and country that he lived when he did. His natural gifts of mind and heart, independent of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, were of a high order and made him pre-eminent in leadership; not only was he a great ruler of an important diocese in a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> remarkable for distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but also a master-builder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and one of the most helpful and sagacious of the makers of America. Church and nation are indebted forever to the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and citizen whose strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, and indomitable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and invaluable service constituted him the man needed in his day to meet critical conditions. He was resolute, fearless, far-sighted and full of practical wisdom based on the sanest and soundest principles. To bring out the innate powers within him required but the opportunity presented by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> struggling for a footing in a rather hostile community, and by the nation endeavoring to cope with harassing questions at home and impending trouble abroad. His failures were few; his achievements many and lasting. He was feared and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>; misunderstood and idolized; misrepresented even to his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whose confidence in him, however, remained unshaken. Severe of manner, kindly of heart, he was not aggressive until assailed.

<p>He was a forceful, impressive and convincing speaker; an able, resourceful and talented controversialist, a clear, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and direct writer. His writing were usually hastily done, as occasion required, but commanded general attention from friend and opponent His works are published in two volumes, which contain lectures, sermons, and pamphlets on historical and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> subjects; open letters to men like Horace Greeley, General Cass, Mayor Harper, Senator Brooks and "Kirwin Unmasked", a series of six letters to a <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> minister, writing under the assumed name of Kirwin; these letters are considered models of good English and are among the best written by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. His mortal remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the old St. Patrick's but were transferred 30 January, 1883 to their final resting place under the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Fifth Avenue. His death elicited a general expression of sympathy and respect, and his memory was honored by tributes from President Lincoln and Secretary Seward, Governor Seymour and the Common Council of New York.
