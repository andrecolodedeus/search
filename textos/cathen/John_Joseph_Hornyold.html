<h1>John Joseph Hornyold</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Phiomelia, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Midland District, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; born 19 February, 1706; died at Longbirch, Staffordshire, 26 December, 1778. He was descended from two ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> being John Hornyold, of Blackmore Park and Hanley Castle, Worcestershire; his mother, Mary, daughter of Sir Pyers Mostyn, Baronet, of Talacre, Flintshire. At the age of twenty-two, on 7 August, 1758, he entered the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and served the mission at Grantham for some time, meeting with much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and more than once narrowly escaping arrest as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1739 he went as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Longbirch near Wolverhampton, the seat of "the good Madam Giffard", a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> remarkable for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity. While there he published his first work, "The Decalogue Explained", published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1744, and afterwards running through many editions. <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a>, in a Memoir of him in the "Laity's Directory" (1818), says: "This was so generally approved of, that he received something like official thanks from Oxford for the publication. It was not to be expected, however, that he should be thanked from that quarter for his other works, which appeared in succession, on the Sacraments and on the Creed." In the former of these, "The Sacraments Explained" (London, 1747), he included several discourses written by his predecessor at Longbirch, the Rev. John Johnson. The book on the Creed was called "The Real Principles of Catholicks or a Catechism for the Adult" (London, 1749), One of the later editions appeared as "Grounds of the Christian Belief or the (Apostles') Creed Explained" (Birmingham, 1771). In this book, according to Charles Butler, he made large use of <a href="../cathen/04372a.htm">Corker's</a> "Roman Catholic Principles in Reference to God and the King", but this was denied by <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner</a>.

<p>In 1751 the aged <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Midland District, Bishop Stonor, applied for a coadjutor and Hornyold was selected. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 Feb., 1752, but continued to act as Mrs. Giffard's <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> until her death, 13 Feb., 1753. Her house was then rented for the use of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and Dr. Hornyold resided there for the rest of his life. On Bishop Stonor's death, 29 March, 1756, he succeeded as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Midland District and ruled <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for twenty-two years. In 1766, as his health was failing, he obtained the <a href="../cathen/14434a.htm">Hon. and Rev. Thomas Talbot</a> as his coadjutor, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him in 1767 (not in 1776 as has been <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> asserted, in consequence of a misprint in <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner's</a> "Memoir"). In 1768 he undertook the responsibility of carrying on Sedgley Park School, which had been founded, on the initiative of his intimate friend Bishop Challoner, six years previously, and thus preserved it for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He lived just long enough to see the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Act of 1778, and on his death was buried in Brewood Churchyard, Staffordshire. There is an oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> seat, Blackmore Park, Worcestershire.
