<h1>John Kemp</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; b. at Wye, Kent, about 1380; d. at Lambeth, 22 March, 1454. He was the son of Thomas Kemp of Ollantigh, near Ashford, and Beatrice Lewknor, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Merton College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. Having become doctor of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> he practised as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lawyer with such success that in 1415 he was made dean of the <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">Court of Arches</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. King Henry V also utilized his diplomatic talents in several embassies. Appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> provision, 26 June, 1419, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the following December. In 1421 he was translated to <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, and eight months later to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, by provision of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. On the death of King Henry V, whom he had served as Chancellor of Normandy, he was made a member of the new council, in which capacity he supported Cardinal Beaufort against Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. In 1426 he was made first Chancellor and then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>.

<p>His political differences with Gloucester led to his resigning the chancellorship in 1432, but he continued to be active in public life as a supporter of the peace party, who wished to end the long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1433 he was the head of the important but fruitless embassy to the congress of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, when a settlement was vainly attempted under the auspices of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. In 1439 he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, his title being Sancta Balbina. After the deaths of his opponent Gloucester and his friend Beaufort, he set himself to resist the power of the Duke of Suffolk, and in 1450 he was again chancellor. In this capacity he put down the Kentish rebellion, and amid the growing likelihood of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> remained the mainstay of the king's party against the Yorkists. In 1452 <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> transferred him from York to <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, giving him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on 24 Sept. The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> made him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal bishop</a> by dividing the See of Porto from that of Santa Rufina and making Kemp <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the last-named diocese. His last days were agitated by the tumultuous proceedings of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> citizens, who, supported by the Yorkists, were threatening him with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, when the end came. He lies buried in Canterbury <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. More statesman than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he was accused with reason of neglecting his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but his private life was distinguished by wisdom, learning and uprightness.
