<p>J<font size=-2>OHN A</font> L<font size=-2>ASCO</font>.

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, b. at Lask, 1456; d. at <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, 19 May, 1531. In 1482 he entered the service of the royal arch-chancellor Kurzowcki, who made him <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Skalmirez and of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> in Posen, and canon of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Krakow</a>. In 1502 he became royal arch-secretary, in 1505 arch-chancellor, in 1509 coadjutor of Archbishop Boryszewski of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, and, after the death of the latter in 1510, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, whereupon he resigned as arch-chancellor in 1511. In 1513 he took part in the Fifth General Council of the Lateran, when he delivered an oration in which he urged upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to take measures against the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, who had been openly and secretly intriguing against <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> ever since 1466, when it had taken West <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and Ermland from them and begun to exercise its suzerainty over East Prussia. During the progress of the Lateran Council, <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> conferred upon Laski and his successors in the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> the title of <em>legatus natus</em>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> conferring the title is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 July, 1515, and is still preserved in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (no. 625). It was reprinted in Korytowski's "Arcybiscupi Gnieznienscy", II (Posen, 1888), 662. Laski's elevation to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> is aid to have been prevented by King Sigismund. Archbishop Laski was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> upholder of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> within his archdiocese, and a strenuous opponent of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. To put a stop to various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses, he held two <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> at Piotrkow (1510, 12) and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (1513). The seven other <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> which he held were intended chiefly to stem the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Four of these were convened at Lencicz in the years 1522, 1523, 1525, and 1527, and three at Piotrkow in 1526, 1532, and 1533.

<p>Many of the legislative measure passed at these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> are printed in the "Constitutiones synodorum metropolitanae ecclesiae gnesnesis" (Krakow, 1630). Most of the canons and decrees of the earlier <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> Laski edited in his "Sanctiones ecclesiasticae tam ex pontificum decretis quam ex constitutionibus synodorum provinciae excerptae, in primis autem statuta in diversis provincialibus synodis a se sancita" (Krakow, 1525), in his "Statuta provincialia" (1512), and "Statuta provinciae Gnesnensis" (1527). After the marriage of King Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> with Barbara Zapolya, in 1512, Archbishop Laski entered into friendly relations with John Zaploya, a brother of Barbara and an aspirant to the crown of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He sent his nephew Jerome Laki to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to assist Zapolya, with money and troops in his opposition against the rightful King Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. If we make believe his enemies (especially Cardinal Gattinara), he continued to support his nephew even after the latter allied himself with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Sultan Soliman with the purpose of marching upon <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In 1530 he was cited to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> to give an account of his actions. His departure was, however delayed by King Sigismund, and he died the following year after expressing his desire to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Besides collecting the synodal legislations mentioned above, he made a compilation of the most important <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> while he was arch-chancellor. The work is entitled "Commune inclyti Poloniae regni privilegiorum, constitutionum et indultuum", etc., and was published at Cracow in 1506. His "Liber beneficiorum archidioces Gnesnesis" was by Korytowski (Gnesen, 1880-1).
