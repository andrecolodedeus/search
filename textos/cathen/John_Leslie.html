<h1>John Leslie</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13201a.htm">Ross</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, born 29 September, 1527, died at Guirtenburg, near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> 30 May, 1596. He was of the ancient House of Leslie of Balquhain, but apparently <a href="../cathen/02579b.htm">illegitimate</a>, as in July, 1538, a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was granted to him to take orders, notwithstanding this defect. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> first at Aberdeen University, and afterwards in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, studying at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and graduating as doctor of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Returning home, he became professor of canon law at <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1558, presented to the parsonage of Oyne, and appointed official of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. We find him in 1560 named by the Lords of the Congregation to discuss points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> against <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a> and Willock. In the following year he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to bring to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> the young <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, with whom he was associated during the years which followed. In 1565 she made him a member of her privy council, and in the same year, on the death of Henry Sinclair, he was nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13201a.htm">Ross</a>. He also held the office of judge or lord of session, and was co-editor of the "Actis and Constitutiounis of the Realme of Scotland from the Reigne of James I", the work of a commission appointed by the queen, at his suggestion, to revise and publish the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the kingdom. On Mary's escape from Lochleven in 1568, she was joined by Leslie, who never wavered in his fidelity to her cause; and he was her principal commissioner at the abortive conference with Queen Elizabeth's commissioners at York.

<p>For favouring the project of Mary's marriage with the Duke of Norfolk, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Elizabeth, first at <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, and then in the Tower of London. During his absence from <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> he was deprived of the revenues of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and was reduced to great poverty. <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a> prints an interesting letter addressed by him to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1580 showing the efforts he made, though absent from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to confirm those wavering in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and recover those who had fallen away. Liberated in 1573, but banished from the country, he visited various <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> courts to plead the cause of his queen, and finally went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> appointed him his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1579. James VI restored the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, his mother's lifelong friend and champion, to his former dignities, but he never returned to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>.

<p>In letters he is principally remembered as the author of a Latin amount of the history of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> "De origine, moribus, ac rebus gestis Scotiae libri decem" (Rome, 1578), a Scottish version by Dom E.B. Cody, O.S.B. It comes down to 1571, and in its latter part presents a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> account of contemporary events.
