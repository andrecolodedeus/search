<h1>John Lynch</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Historian</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1599; d. in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1673; was the son of Alexander Lynch, who kept a classical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>. In such repute was this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> held that there were no less than 1200 students, nor were they confined to Connaught alone but came from every province in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to keep a public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in those days was a serious offense, and when Ussher visited <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> in 1615, calling Lynch before him he severely reprimanded him, compelled him to close his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at once, and bound him under heavy bail not to reopen it. Young Lynch received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and from him imbibed his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of classical learning. Feeling a call to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he left <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, pursued his studies under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> there, in due time was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and returned to his native town in 1622. He established a classical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which like his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> was attended by many students. Penal legislation compelled him to exercise his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministry</a> by stealth, and to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in secret places and private houses. But after 1642 the churches were open and he was free to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in public, and exercise his ministry in the light of day. More of a scholar and of a student than of a politician, Lynch took no prominent part in the stirring events of the next ten years. His opinions however were well known. Like so many others of the Anglo-Irish, though he abhorred the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> against his <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> and had suffered from them, he was loyal to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He therefore condemned the rebellion of 1641, viewed with no enthusiasm the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Confederation, approved of the cessation of 1643 and of the peace of 1646 and 1648, and entirely disapproved of the policy of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> and of the conduct of <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> at which he became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> is uncertain. Driven from <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a> after the capture of the city by the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> in 1652, he lived the remainder of his life in exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. During these years he wrote a biography of his uncle Dr. Kirwan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08640a.htm">Killala</a>, and a work called "Alithonologia", giving an account of the Anglo-Irish under Elizabeth. But his greatest work is "Cambrensis Eversus", published in 1662. Written in vigorous Latin and characterized by great learning and research, its declared object was to expose the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Gerald Barry</a> about <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> Lynch completely vindicates his country "against the aspersions of her <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderer</a>."
