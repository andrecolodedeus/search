<h1>John Martiall</h1>  

<p>(Or MARSHALL)

<p>Born in Worcestershire 1534, died at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, 3 April, 1597. He was one of the six companions associated with Dr. Allen in the foundation of the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1568. He received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> (1545-49) and New College, Oxford (1549-56), at which latter place, after a residence of seven years, he graduated as <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">bachelor</a> of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in 1556. He next accepted a post as assistant master at his old <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> under Thomas Hyde; but soon after the <a href="../cathen/01095a.htm">accession</a> of Elizabeth, both of them found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to quit the country. Marshall retired to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where a number of English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> exiles were residing. Thence he removed to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, when he joined the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> recently founded there, and graduated B.D. in 1567. Thus it came about that when Allen arrived to found his new college, Marshall was already in residence, and willingly attached himself to the new foundation, which was destined to play so important a part in English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs in the future. He did not, however, remain long, chiefly because of the smallness of the allowance which it was possible to give; later on, he obtained a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter at the neighbouring city of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>. Owing to the disturbed state of the country, he was not installed until 1579. He lived to enjoy his dignity for eighteen years. It was during his residence at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> that he brought out the two chief literary works for which he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The first of these, "Treatise of the Cross" (Antwerp, 1564), was a defence of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the Cross, and he dedicated it to Queen Elizabeth, being "emboldened upon her keeping the image of a crucifix in her <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>". He was attacked by James Calfhill, the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, which brought forth his "Reply" (Louvain, 1566). He also wrote a treatise on the "Tonsure of Clerks", which is still in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
