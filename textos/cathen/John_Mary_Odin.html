<h1>John Mary Odin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missionary, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a> and second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, b. 25 Feb., 1801, at Hauteville, Ambierle, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. there 25 May, 1870. The seventh of ten children, like most country boys he worked on his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> farm. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the poor being looked on as a sign of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vocation, he was sent when nine years of age to study Latin under his uncle, cure of Nosilly, whose death soon ended this desultory teaching. After two years at home, he studied the classics at Roanne and Verriere and was a brilliant student of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at L'Argentiere and Alix. He was prompt to answer Bishop Dubourg's appeal for volunteers for the Louisiana mission. Reaching <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in June, 1822, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, The Barrens, 80 miles from St. Louis, Mo., to complete his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. There he joined the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. (Clarke in his lives of deceased <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the U.S. <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> states that he entered at an early age in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.) He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 4 May, 1824, and to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were added those of teaching. In vacation he preached to the Indians on the Arkansas River, for whose conversion he was most eager. In 1825 he was at times in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, college, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. He also gave missions to non-Catholics and to the Indians, until, his health failing, it was decided to send him abroad, where he could also gather recruits and funds for the missions. Accompanying Bishop Rosati to the second Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, he was commissioned by the council to bring its decrees to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for approval. Two years were spent abroad in the interest of "his poor America". Pastoral work, chiefly at Cape Girardeau, where he opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (1838), and missions occupied the next five years. Sent to <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> in 1840 as vice-prefect by his provincial visitor, Father Timon, whom the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had made <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> of the new republic, he began the hardest kind of labor among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, many of whom had fallen away amid the disorders accompanying the change of government, and among non-Catholics and the fierce Comanche Indians. His gentleness and self-sacrifice wrought wonders. His great work was early recognized and he was nominated to the coadjutorship of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> but declined. A year later he was named <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04008a.htm">Claudiopolis</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 6 March, 1842. He had already succeeded with Father Timon's help in having the Republic recognize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to the possessions that were hers under the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> government. In 1845 he went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and secured many recruits for his mission. In 1847 <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and Bishop Odin's see was fixed at <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>. On the death of Archbishop Blanc of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, he was promoted to that see 15 February, 1861. Neither his age nor infirmities kept him from a vigilant care of his flock. War had wrought havoc during his time in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> scourged his archdiocese now. His influence was extraordinary among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> wrote to him in the South, as to Archbishop Hughes in the North, to use their influence for peace. His Apostolic labours were interrupted only by journeys to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the interest of his archdiocese. Despite greatly impaired health he went to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he grew so ill that he was granted leave to return to Heauteville where he died.
