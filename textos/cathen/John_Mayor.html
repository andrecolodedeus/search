<h1>John Mayor</h1>  

<p>(MAJOR, MAIR; also called JOANNES MAJORIS and HADDINGTONUS SCOTUS)

<p>A Scotch <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and historian, b. at Gleghornie near Haddington, 1496; d. at St. Andrew's, 1550. He studied at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Cambridge, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was graduated as <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master of arts</a> in the College of St. Barbe in 1494 and as doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the College of Montaigu in 1505. He spent the greater part of his remaining life as professor of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; from 1505-18 at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, from 1518-23 at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, from 1523-5 at the University of St. Andrew's, and from 1525-1530 again at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1530 he returned to St. Andrew's and was made <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Salvator's College, a position which he occupied until his death. One of the greatest scholastic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of his times, he had among his pupils the future Scotch reformers <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a>, Patrick Hamilton, and George Buchanan. In philosophy he was the chief exponent of the nominalistic or terministic tendency which was then prevalent at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, while, as a canonist, he held that the chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority does not reside in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> but in the whole Church. In like manner he held that the source of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> lies with the people who transfer it to the ruler and can wrest it from him, even by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. He remained a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> until his death, though in 1549 he advocated a national Church for <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. His numerous literary productions were all written in Latin. His chief work, "Historia majoris Britannae, tam Angliae quam Scotiae" (Paris, 1521 and Edinburgh, 1740), translated into English for the first time by Archibald Constable, "History of the Greater Britain, both England and Scotland" (Edinburgh, 1892), is written in barbarous Latin, but truthfully and faithfully portrays the author's vigour and spirit of independence. His other works are mostly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, viz: a commentary on <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard's</a> Books of Sentences (Paris, 1508), "Introductorium" or a commentary on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> dialectics (Paris, 1508), the lectures which he delivered on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> in the College of Montaigu (Lyons, 1516), commentaries on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> physical and <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> writings (Paris, 1526), "Quaestiones logicales" (Paris, 1528), a commentary on the four Gospels (Paris, 1529). He was also the first to edit the so-called "Reportia Parisiensia" of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> (Paris, 1517-8).
