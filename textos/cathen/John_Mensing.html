<h1>John Mensing</h1>  

<p>(MENSINGK)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and celebrated opponent of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, born according to some at Z&uuml;tphen, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, but more probably at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; died about 1541. In 1495 he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> and made part of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in the <em>studium</em> of his province. Matriculating at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> in 1515, he received there in 1517 the licentiate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and the following year received in Frankfort-on-the-Oder the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> from the hands of the general of his order. According to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> historian, Qu&eacute;tif, he taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in 1514 in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Ulm, but it is highly improbable that Mensing, belonging to the province of Saxony, should act as professor in another province which had no <em>studium generale</em> of its own. He lived at a time when controversy was rife, when men, abandoning beaten paths, began to set up systems of their own. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teachings of the reformers spread rapidly throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. No province seemed exempt from the invasions of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> emissaries. To prevent these <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> innovations from gaining a foothold in his province, Mensing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> entered into all the controversies with the sectaries. From 1522 to 1524 he occupied the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, where he also composed his first <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetic</a> works on the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. Notwithstanding his efforts, the boldness of the enemy forced him to leave and seek other fields of labour. Upon the invitation of the Princess Margaretha von Anhalt, who ruled during the minority of her sons, he proceeded to Dessau to support her in her efforts against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in her territory. In 1529 he was professor in the University of Frankfort-on-the-Oder and preacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The following year he attended, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to the Elector Joachim von Anhalt, the Diet of Augsburg, and secured from <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> a renewal of the letter of protection for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> which Charles IV had granted them in 1355 and 1359. In 1534 he was elected <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his own province, but before the termination of his office <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> made him suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt. In 1540 and 1541 he attended the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences of Worms and <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, where with <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a>, the vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11608a.htm">Pelargus</a>, he took a leading part in the deliberations. His vast <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and remarkable command of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> made him one of the foremost controversialists of the first half of the sixteenth century. A complete list of his works, all of which bear a polemical tinge, is given by <a href="../cathen/14315d.htm">Streber</a> in the "Kirchenlexikon".
