<h1>John Milner</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 14 October, 1752: died at Wolverhampton, 19 April, 1826.

<p>At the age of twelve he went to Sedgley Park School, but the following year he was sent by the venerable Bishop Challoner to the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai, France</a>, to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He remained twelve years, but he does not seem to have distinguished himself in any special manner there.

<p>On his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in 1777 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Two years later he was sent to Winchester to assist the French <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in that city, among whom a fever had broken out; and when the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, Rev. Mr. Nolan, fell a victim to the fever, Milner was permanently appointed in his place. Winchester was then one of the few towns in the south of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was openly supported. Its existence was indeed illegal, for the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> were still in full force; but practically there was not much prospect of its being interfered with. Milner remained there twenty-three years, during which time he devoted himself to missionary work, rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was at the time going through a double crisis, partly by the action of its own members, and partly by the influence from without, due to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Some thousands of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and were supported by the Government. Some 700 were lodged in the old unfinished king's house outside Winchester, where they formed themselves into a large <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community. Milner, who was brought into daily contact with them, spoke in high terms of the extraordinary edification of their daily lives. The same events on the Continent led to the breaking up of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Low Countries, and the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> fled for refuge to their own country, where they arrived penniless and helpless. A great effort was made to assist them. Milner took his share in the movement by establishing in his mission the Benedectine <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, formerly of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, with whom he ever afterwards maintained cordial relations. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> likewise settled at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>.

<p>During succeeding years, Milner began to make his name as a writer and controversialist. His "History of Winchester" appeared in 1798, and showed remarkable power and learning. It led to a controversy with Dr. Sturges, a <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which brought forth two of Milner's best-known works, "Letters to a Prebendary" and "The End of Religious Controversy". In deference to the wishes of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, the last-named work was withheld for the sake of peace, and it did not see the light until nearly twenty years later. It was during his residence at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> that Milner was first brought into contact with the public affairs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which formed the other aspect of the crisis in that body. The Cisalpine or antipapal movement among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> was beginning, the moving spirit being Charles Butler, nephew of Alban Butler, a lawyer of eminence and reputation, and the lifelong opponent of Milner. The movement also affected some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the well-known writer, <a href="../cathen/02491a.htm">Rev. Joseph Berington</a>, being the most notable example. Milner, who had a keen sense of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, directed all his endeavors to combating this movement. His writings were numerous and powerful, but they had the defect of unceasing asperity of language, so that he continued to embitter the strife. The committee of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, elected first in 1782, and reelected five years later, were the centre of such opinions, and towards the end three <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were added, two of whom (<a href="../cathen/14432a.htm">James Talbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/02490b.htm">Charles Berington</a>) were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The object of the committee was to help to bring about <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> emancipation. With this end in view, in 1789 they issued a "Protestation", disclaiming some of the more objectionable doctrines with which they were popularly credited, including the deposing power and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>. Despite the Cisalpine tone of the document, it was signed by nearly 1500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> including all the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, though the signatures of two were afterwards withdrawn. Pitt who was then Prime Minister promised to introduce a bill of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> relief; but when it was drafted, it was found to contain an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were to be called upon to take, based on the "protestation", but in stronger language, and containing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to which no good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could set his name; while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> throughout were called by the absurd title of "Protesting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Dissenters". The four <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> met at Hammersmith, in October, 1789, Milner attending as <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> adviser. They unanimously condemned the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and the new appellation. During the following year the Bishops of the Northern and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Districts died. A great effort was made by the committee to secure the transference of <a href="../cathen/02490b.htm">Bishop Charles Berington</a> to the London District. This would have been a triumph for the Cisalpines; but fortunately it did not succeed. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being warned, appointed Dr. Douglass, a Yorkshireman, who had been outside the late disputes.

<p>The committee now suggested some modification of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; but it was not sufficient to free it from objection, and three out of the four <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> joined in condemning it a second time. When the Relief Bill was brought forward in February, 1791, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> called Milner to their assistance. By means of his vigorous action an impression was made on the Government and the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was further modified; but the situation was really saved after his return to <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, when the House of Lords, at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. David's, substituted a totally different <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> for the one objected to; and in this form the Bill was passed. It abolished the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> properly so-called and legalized the celebration of Mass; but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> continued liable to numerous disabilities for many years afterwards. After this the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee dissolved; but the chief members re-formed themselves into an association to which they gave the name of the Cisalpine Club and which lasted for many years. Milner continued to write and speak in opposition to them. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who were supporters of the Cisalpine spirit were chiefly in the Midland District, one group who had acted together being known as the Staffordshire Clergy. By a strange fate it was this very district over which Milner was called to rule in 1803, when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03407c.htm">Castabala</a>, and appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Midland District. It is creditable both to them and to Milner himself that the resulting state of tension was of short duration. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> learned to value the great qualities of their new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and conceived an admiration of him, the tradition of which has lasted to the present day.



<p>Milner, however, was not satisfied with his position in the Midlands. He had formed an alliance with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and with their co-operation, a determined attempt was made to have him transferred to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> as coadjutor with right of succession. This scheme was opposed by Bishop Douglass, and ultimately defeated, though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> consented that Milner should become parliamentary agent to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in their struggle to procure <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> emancipation, and that for this purpose he should be permitted to go to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> as often as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. This unfortunate disagreement with his colleagues led to regrettable results. Milner found fault with the manner in which the London District was governed, and was not afraid to say so publicly, in numerous pamphlets and other publications, and even in his pastorals. The subjects of contention were several; but two especially may be mentioned. One was the well-known "Veto" question, which first came into prominence in the year 1808. By this it was intended to concede to the Crown a negative voice in the election of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by conferring a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to veto any candidate whose loyalty was open to question. The chief <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had agreed to the measure in 1799; but since then, owing to the postponement of emancipation, the scheme had dropped. Milner revived it, and was for a time the warm advocate of the veto. He found himself in opposition to most of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and afterwards wrote his "Letter to a Parish Priest" (who was really an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) in defence of his position. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, however, condemned the Veto in 1808. A year later Milner was converted to their way of thinking, and became as vigorous in opposition to it as he had been before in its favour. About this time the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in presenting a petition to Parliament, embodied what was known as their "Fifth Resolution", offering a "grateful concurrence" to a Bill which would give them emancipation, accompanied by any "arrangements" for the safe-guarding of the Established Church which should not be inconsistent with their religion. Milner declared &mdash; contrary to the assertions of the framers of the Resolution &mdash; that the "arrangements" intended, included the Veto, and he denounced those who signed the petition, including all the other <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In this he received the support of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Another source of criticism was the want of vigour which he alleged against the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Vicar in combating the Blanchardist <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> among the French emigrant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially the restoration of one of them, Abb&eacute; de Travaux, to spiritual faculties without a public retraction. In this matter also he was supported by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>A crisis occurred in 1813, Dr. Poynter being then <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the London District. A Bill for the full emancipation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was introduced into the House of Commons by Grattan; but Lord Castlereagh and Mr. Canning introduced amending clauses giving the Crown a veto on the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to be exercised only on the recommendation of a committee consisting chiefly of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Peers. Milner and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> maintained that no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could assent to this without incurring <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> did not go so far as this, though they opposed the clauses. The leading members of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Board, consisting chiefly of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, were in favour of accepting them as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> price to pay for emancipation. Milner, however, used all his influence to procure the rejection of the Bill. He printed a "Brief Memorial" in this sense, and distributed it among members of Parliament. The Bill passed its second reading, but in committee the clause admitting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to Parliament was defeated by a small majority of four votes, and the Bill was abandoned. Milner took to himself the credit of having been the cause of its defeat, and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were so angry with him that, to their permanent disgrace, they publicly expelled him from the committee of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Board. In the meantime Dr. Poynter appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for guidance in the expected event of the re-introduction of the Bill. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was at that time a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> were dispersed. In their absence Mgr. Quarantotti, Secretary of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, using the powers with which he had been provisionally invested, issued a Rescript, dated February, 1814, approving of the Bill as it stood. Milner did not fail to see the serious results which would follow from this and decided immediately to appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who having been liberated from captivity, was on his way back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His journey was so far successful that the Quarantotti Rescript was recalled, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered the whole matter to be examined afresh. In the end a decision was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the shape of a letter from <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a>, Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, to Dr. Poynter, who had also come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The provisions of the late Bill were condemned; but on the general question of the veto, apart from the Lay Committees, the decision was against Milner; subject to certain safeguards, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were empowered to concede a veto to the Crown, provided this negative power was so limited as not to be allowed to grow into a positive <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>. This led to further agitation in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and another deputation was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, including Milner himself, accepted the decision without question. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> were, however, naturally opposed to the veto, and in the event it never became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to utilize the permission granted.

<p>On his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Milner continued to write controversially, the new "Orthodox Journal" being a frequent medium for his communications. His language was as harsh as ever, and unbecoming in a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, until at length an appeal was made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Cardinal Fontana, who was then Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, forbade him to write in it anymore. During the last years of his life Milner withdrew to a great extent from public politics. He ceased to act on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and though he did not hold any intercourse with the other <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, he ceased to write against them. He devoted himself to literary work. In 1818 his "End of Controversy", perhaps the best known of all his books, at length appeared, and it was followed by a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of pamphlets and replies which went on for several years. Feeling his health failing, he applied for a coadjutor, and Rev. Thomas Walsh, President of Oscott College, was appointed. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1825 when all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> met, and a reconciliation was effected. Milner survived less than a year, his death taking place at his house at Wolverhampton on 19 April, 1826. He left behind him a record of a life marked by whole-hearted devotion to religion, and of eminent services rendered to a cause, both as a writer and a man of action. In both capacities his work was marred by the asperity of his language, and his intolerance of any views different from his own. This made him many enemies through life, and cut him off from his brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the greater part of his episcopate. But his lot was cast at a difficult time, and he succeeded in combating difficulties which few other men would have faced. He had the advantage of a strong constitution; his vigour and activity were phenomenal, and, added to his devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, earned for him the title of the English <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>.

<p>There are many portraits of Milner: (1) sketch, age about 25; (2) miniature, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 1803; (3) miniature by Kernan (1808 &mdash; considered the best likeness); (4) <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by Barber, drawing master at Oscott, 1817; (5) <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by Herbert, R.A. &mdash; said to be the most like, but it is in Gothic vestments and <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, having been <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> long after Milner's death. (These are all at Oscott.) (6) Painting of Milner as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, age about 45, at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, east Bergholt. (7) Painting at the presbytery, <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, very similar to (5). (8) Engraving in "Laity's Directory", 1827, from a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by Radcliffe (Orth. Jour., I, 173). (9) Bust, by Clark, sen. of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>: many copies to be met with. (1), (2), and (6) reproduced in the "Dawn of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Revival"; (8) in Miss Harting's "Catholic <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Mission"; (4) in "Catholic London a Century ago"; (5) in the penny "Life of Milner," by Rev.
