<h1>John Morris</h1>  

<p>Canon, afterwards <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, F.S.A., b. in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 4 July, 1826; d. at Wimbledon, 22 Oct., 1893, son of John Carnac Morris, F.R.S. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> partly in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, partly at Harrow, partly in reading for Cambridge with Dean Alford, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> scholar. Under him a great change passed over Morris's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Giving up the thought of taking the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as his profession, he became enthusiastic for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antiquities, took a deep interest in the Tractarian movement, and resolved to become an <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican clergyman</a>. Going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October, 1845, he became the friend, and then the pupil of F.A. Paley, grandson of the well-known divine, and already one of the leading Greek scholars of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The conversion of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, followed by the receptions of so many others, deeply impressed him, and he was reconciled by Bishop Wareing, 20 May, 1846. A storm followed, beginning in the "Times", which made itself felt even in Parliament. Paley had to leave Cambridge (which led to his subsequently joining the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), while Morris was practically cast off by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He then went to the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, under <a href="../cathen/06726b.htm">Dr. Grant</a>, and was there during the revolution of 1848. Soon after the restoration of the English Hierarchy in 1850, he was made Canon of <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, and then returned as vice-rector to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1853-1856). He now became <em>postulator</em> for the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English Martyrs</a>, whose cause owes perhaps more to him than to any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he took part in the third Synod of Westminster, became secretary to <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, whom he affectionately nursed on his death-bed, and served under <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a>, until he became a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> in 1867. He taught Church History from 1873-1874; he was Rector of St. Ignatius' College, <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, from 1877-78; master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in 1879; and director of the writers of the English Province in 1888. Always remarkable for his ardent affectionate nature, his untiring energy and earnest <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, he was also an excellent scholar, an eloquent speaker, and a high-principled leader of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. His death befitted his life; for he expired in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, uttering the words, "Render to God the things that are God's." His principal works are: "The Life and Martyrdom of St. Thomas Becket" (London, 1859 and 1885); "The Life of Father John Gerard" (London, 1881), translated into French, German, Spanish, and Polish; "Troubles of our Catholic Forefathers" (3 vols., London, 1872-1877); "Letter-books of Sir Amias Poulet" (London, 1874); and many contributions to "The Month", "The Dublin Review", "Arch&aelig;ologia", and other periodicals.
