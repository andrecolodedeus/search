<h1>John Mush</h1>  

<p>(Alias RATCLIFFE)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, b. in Yorkshire, 1551 or 1552; d. at Wenge, Co. Bucks, 1612 or 1613, not as Bishop Challoner thought, in 1617. Having spent six months in the English College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1576) where he studied for seven years. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1583) and laboured at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, being confessor, to <a href="../cathen/04059b.htm">Venerable Margaret Clitherow</a> who suffered for harbouring him, and <a href="../cathen/08007c.htm">Venerable Francis Ingleby</a>. Arrested 28 Oct., 1586, and condemned to die, he escaped with two other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For many years he laboured in the North becoming a recognized leader among his brother <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. When the dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Wisbech broke out in 1595, he with Dr. Dudley went there to arbitrate. Failing in this, together with John Colleton he set himself to devise some organization of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> character among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> which might supply the want of episcopal government much felt after the death of <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a> in 1594. Opposed by <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a>, it was rendered superfluous by the appointment of an <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> (1599). In the ensuing controversy Mush was one of the appellant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>. In connection with this he wrote "Declaratio Motuum" and in 1602, with <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a>, Bluet and Cecil, went as a deputation to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where for eight months they fought for their petition. Their petition, first for six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and then for six archpriests, was refused; but though the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> succeeded in maintaining his position, the appellants were acquited of the charges of rebellion and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Mush was one of the thirteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who signed the protestation of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth (1603). In his later years he acted as assistant to two successive archpriests, Hiackwell and Birkhead, in Yorkshire, but he seems to have been acting as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Lady Dormer in Buckinghamshire at the time of his death. His works are "The Life and Death of Mistress Margaret Clitherow" (written 1586, first printed 1849); "An account of the sufferings of Catholics in the Northern Parts or England" (probably the same as the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> account printed by Father Morris, S.J. in "Troubles of our Catholic Forefathers", series iii); "Declaratio Motuum" (Rouen, 1601). His diary of the deputation to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1602 is preserved in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, in the Inner Temple, London. <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a> also says he wrote against the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Thomas Bell, and <a href="../cathen/12120a.htm">Pitts</a> quotes his English translation of "Lectiones Panagorali Turini", but these latter works are not now known to exist.
