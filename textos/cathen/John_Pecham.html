<h1>John Pecham</h1>  

<p>(PECCHAM)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, born about 1240; died 6 December, 1292. His birthplace was Patcham in Sussex, called in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Pecham (Peccham), in common with Peckham in Surrey and Kent. He received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Lewes, but it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether he was a student at Merton College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. He also studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was tutor to the nephew of H. de Andegavia, and later entered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>. He succeeded Thomas de Bungay, O.F.M., and taught divinity, being the first to dispute de Quolibet at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; Pecham became ninth Provincial of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (<a href="../cathen/11504a.htm">Parkinson</a> says twelfth), and was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1276 and appointed <em><a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> sacri palatii</em>. When <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert Kilwardby</a> resigned the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Edward I requested Pecham to take up the cause of Robert Burnell, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>, and Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but in January, 1279, Pecham himself was elected to that see, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>. He held a <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> at <a href="../cathen/12673a.htm">Reading</a>, 31 July, 1279, in which he carried out the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> verbal instructions and published fresh enactments against pluralities. In October, 1281, he summoned another <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> to Lambeth, where among other matters his solicitude for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> is noteworthy. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> prompted him to visit every part of his province, uprooting abuses wherever he found them. He compelled the royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> which claimed exemption to submit to the visitation. On this occasion he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he had inherited the fearless <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of his predecessors, yet retained the royal favour. He intervened with success in behalf of Almeric de Montfort, and had Llewellyn listened to him, he might have averted his own fate and that of his country. His suffragans complained that his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> had led him beyond the limits of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and deputed <a href="../cathen/14694c.htm">St. Thomas of Hereford</a> to carry their joint appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where apparently it was upheld. At Oxford he renewed the condemnation of certain <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> already censured by <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert Kilwardby</a>, many of them containing <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, but several of them enunciated by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, and afterwards commonly accepted in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. ("Nineteenth Century and after", January, 1911, p. 74.) In forming an estimate of his character a complete absence of subserviency and an unswerving adherence to principle come into view, but his frequent exertions in favour of the poor and against anything like oppression must not be overlooked. His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, sincerity, and constancy in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office, and strict observance of his rule, won for him the admiration of his contemporaries. As the Apostolic protector of his order he defended it and other Mendicant Orders against their enemies. His remains rest in Canterbury Cathedral, but his heart was buried in the church of the Grey Friars, London. A complete list of his writings is published in "British Society of Franciscan Studies" (vol. II, 1909), his letters (720) are found in Martin's "Registrum Epistolarum Fr. Joannis Peckham". He was an excellent poet, some of his poems being attributed to <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, as was also his "Life of St. Antony of Padua" written as Glasberger states, at the bidding of Jerome of <a href="../cathen/01774a.htm">Ascoli</a>, and recently identified by F. Hilary, O.S.F.C., in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>.
