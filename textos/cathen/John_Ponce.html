<h1>John Ponce</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 1603, died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1670. At an early age he went to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in St. Antony's College, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, began the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, under <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Hugh Ward</a> and <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">John Colgan</a>, was called by <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and admitted 7 Sept., 1625, into the College of St. Isidore which had just been founded for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. After receiving his degrees he was appointed to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and later, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in St. Isidore's. He lectured afterwards at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was held in great repute for his learning. In 1643 he published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> his "Cursus philosophi&aelig;". Some of his opinions were opposed by <a href="../cathen/10040a.htm">Mastrius</a>, and Ponce replied in "Appendix apologeticus" (Rome, 1645), in which he says that although he accepts all the conclusions of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, he does not feel called upon to adopt all <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus's</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. <a href="../cathen/10040a.htm">Mastrius</a> acknowledged the force of Ponce's reasoning and admitted that he had shed light on many <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> problems. In 1652, Ponce published "Integer cursus theologi&aelig;" (Paris). These two works explain with great clearness and precision the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In 1661, he published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> his great work, "Commentarii theologici in quatuor libros sententiarum", called by <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a> <em>opus rarissimum</em>. Ponce also assisted <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a> in editing the works of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> says that he was endowed with a powerful and subtle <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, a great facility of communicating <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, a graceful style, and that though immersed in the severer studies of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> he was an ardent student of the classics. Ponce succeeded Father Martin Walsh in the government of the Ludovisian College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; and for some time he filled the position of superior of St. Isidore's. He had a passionate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his country and was an active agent in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. When dissensions arose among the Confederates, and when <a href="../cathen/02416a.htm">Richard Bellings</a>, secretary to the Supreme Council, published his "Vindici&aelig;" (Paris, 1652), attacking the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, Father Ponce promptly answered with his "Vindiciae Eversae" (Paris, 1652). He had already warned the Confederates not to trust the Royalists. In a letter (2nd July, 1644) to the agent of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Hugo de Burgo, he says: "the English report that the king will not give satisfaction to our commissioners (from the Confederates) though he keep them in expectation and to delay them for his own interest". His works besides those mentioned are "Judicium doctrin&aelig; SS. Augustini et Thom&aelig;", Paris, 1657; "Scotus Hiberniae restitutus" [in answer to <a href="../cathen/09770a.htm">Father Angelus a S. Francisco (Mason)</a>, who claimed <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> as an Englishman]; "Deplorabilis populi Hibernici pro religione, rege et libertate status" (Paris, 1651).
