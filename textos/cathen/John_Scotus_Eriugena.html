<div id="springfield2">
<h1>John Scotus Eriugena</h1>  

<p>An Irish teacher, theologian, philosopher, and poet, who lived in the ninth century.
<h2>Name</h2>

<p>Eriugena's contemporaries invariably refer to him as <em>Joannes Scottus or Joannes Scottigena. </em>In the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the tenth and subsequent centuries the forms <em>Eriugena, Ierugena</em>, and <em>Erigena</em> occur. Of these, the oldest and most acceptable, philologically, is <em>Eriugena,</em> which, as it was perhaps sometimes written<em> Eriygena,</em> was changed into <em>Erigena</em>. It means "a native of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>". The form<em> Ierugena</em> is evidently an attempt to connect the first part of the name with the Greek word <em>hieros</em>, and means "a native of the Island of Saints"; the combination <em>Joannes <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena</em> cannot be traced beyond the sixteenth century.
<h2>Birthplace</h2>

<p>At one time the birthplace of Eriugena was a matter of dispute. Eriuven in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and Ayre in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> claimed the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and each found advocates. Nowadays, however, the claim of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to be considered the birthplace of John is universally admitted. All the evidence points that way, and leads us to conclude that when his contemporaries tauntingly referred to his having come to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> they meant not only that he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the Isle of Saints but also that <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was his birthplace. Whatever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there may have been about the meaning of <em>Scotus, </em>there can be none as to the signification of the surname <em>Eriugena.</em>
<h2>Life</h2>

<p>What is known of the life of Eriugena is very soon told. About 847 he appeared in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the court of Charles the Bald, was received with special favour by that prince, appointed head of the palace <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which seems to have had some kind of permanent location at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was commissioned by his royal patron to translate the works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> into Latin. This translation brought him into prominence in the world of letters and was the occasion of his entering into the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies of the day, especially into those concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and the Eucharist. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek is evident from his translations, and is also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the poems which he wrote. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, on the other hand, whether he possessed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew and other Oriental languages which is sometimes ascribed to him. In any case there is no evidence of his having travelled extensively in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. After leaving <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he spent the rest of his days in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, probably at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Laon. There was, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, an important colony of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholars at the latter place. The tradition that after the death of Charles the Bald he went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the invitation of <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">Alfred the Great</a>, that he taught a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/09572c.htm">Malmesbury</a>, and was there <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by his pupils, has no support in contemporary documents and may well have arisen from some confusion of names on the part of later historians. It is probable that he died in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but the date is unknown. From the evidence available it is impossible to determine whether he was a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, although it is difficult to deny that the general conditions of the time make it more than probable that he was a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> and perhaps a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>.
<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>I. Translations of the works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>: "De Coelesti Hierarchia"; "De Ecclesiastica Hierarchia"; "De Divinis Nominibus"; "De Mystica Theologia"; "Epistolae"; translations of the "Ambigua" of St. Maximus. &mdash; 2. Commentaries: "Homolia in prologum S. Evangelii sec. Joannem", and a commentary on the Gospel of St. John, of which few fragments only have come down to us; commentaries on the "Celestial Hierarchy"and the "Ecclesiastical Hierarchy" of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>; glosses on the work of Martianus Capella (still in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>), and on the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opuscula of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (Rand ed., Munich, 1906), with which is connected a brief "Life" of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> (Pieper ed., "Consolatio Philos.", Leipzig, 1871). &mdash; 3. Theological works: "Liberde Praedestinatione", and very probably a work on the Eucharist, though it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the tract "De Corpore et Sanguine Domini", at one time believed to be Eriugena's, is the work od <a href="../cathen/11518a.htm">Paschasius Radbertus</a>. &mdash; 4. Philosophical works: "De Divisione Naturae", his principal work, and a treatise, "De Egressu et Regressu Animae ad Deum", of which we possess only a few fragments. &mdash; 5. Poems: These are written partly in Latin and partly in Greek. Many of them are dedicated to Charles the Bald. The most complete edition of Eriugena's works is that of Dr. Floss, which is printed as Vol. CXXII of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> P.L. A new edition embodying the results of recent discoveries of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> is often spoken of, and will doubtless be forthcoming before long.
<h2>Doctrines</h2>

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which Eriugena fell both in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> were many and serious, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he himself abhorred <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, was disposed to treat the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> with no small degree of harshness (as is evident from his strictures on Gotteschalk), and all through his life believed himself an unswervingly loyal son of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Taking for granted the authenticity of the works ascribed to <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, he considered that the doctrines he discovered in them were not only philosophically <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but also theologically acceptable, since they carried with them the authority of the distinguished Athenian convert of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. He did not for a moment suspect that in those writings he had to deal with a loosely articulated system of thought in which <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teachings</a> were mingled with the tenets of a subtle but profoundly anti-Christian <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>. To this remark should be added another in order that we may fully understand Eriugena's attitude towards <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. He was accused by his contemporaries of leaning too much towards the Greeks. And, in fact, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> were his favourite authors, especially <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory the Theologian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil the Great</a>. Of the Latins he prized Augustine most highly. The influence of these on the temperament of the venturesome Celt was towards freedom and not towards restraint in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculation. This freedom he reconciled with his respect for the teaching authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as he understood it. However, in the actual exercise of the freedom of speculation which he allowed himself, he fell into many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which are incompatible with <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.



<p>The "<em>De Pradestinatione</em>" seems to have been written after the translation of the works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>. Nevertheless there is in it only one allusion to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and very little of the obtrusion of Greek words and phrases which so abound in the later works. It deals with the problem raised by Gotteschalk regarding the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and, more specifically, undertakes to prove that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is single, not double &mdash; in other words, that there is no <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and punishment but only to grace and eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. The authority of Augustine is used very extensively. In the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> setting of the problem, however &mdash; namely, the discussion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> &mdash; Eriugena appears to go back farther than St. Augustine and to hold the radical <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> view that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is non-existent. He is thus compelled to go even farther than St. Augustine in rejecting the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a double <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. That he exceeded the bounds of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> is the contention of Prudentius of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> and Florus of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> who answered the "Liberde Predestination" in works full of bitter personal attacks on Eriugena. Their views prevailed in the Councils of Valencia (855) and Langres (859), in which Eriugena's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was condemned.

<p>While the "<em>De Corpore et Sanguine Domini</em>" is not Eriugena's, though ascribed to him, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in some work, now lost, on that subject he maintained doctrines at variance with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. From the fragment which has come down to us of his commentary on St. John we infer that he held the Eucharist to be merely a type or figure. At least he insists on the spiritual, to the exclusion, apparently, of the physical, "eating of the Flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>".

<p>In the "<em>De Divisione Naturae"</em>, his most important and systematic work, Eriugena treats in the form of a dialogue the principal problems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The meaning of the title is evident from the opening sentences in which he outlines the plan of the work. "Nature", he says, "is divided into four species": (1) "Nature which creates and is not created" &mdash; this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Source and Principle of all things; (2) "Nature which is created and creates" &mdash; this is the world of primordial causes or (<a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>) <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; (3) "Nature which is created and does not create" &mdash; this is the world of phenomena, the world of contingent, sense-perceived things; (4) "Nature which neither creates nor is created" &mdash; this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Term to which all things are returning.

<p>(1) "Nature", then, is synonymous with reality, and also with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, whatever reality the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the world of phenomena possess, is, in the truest and most literal sense, the reality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. "The being of all things is the over-being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<em>esse omnium est superesse Divinitatis</em>) is a saying which he never tires of quoting from the works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>. So supremely perfect is the essence of the Divinity that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is incomprehensible not only to us but also to Himself. For if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Himself in any adequate sense He should place Himself in some category of thought, which would be to limit Himself. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is above all categories. When, therefore, we speak about Him we are safer in using the negative (<em>apophatike</em>) than the positive (<em>kataphatike</em>) mode of predication. That is, we are safer in predicating what He is not than in venturing to predicate what He is. If we have recourse to positive predication, we must use the prefix <em>hyper </em>and say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <em>hypersubstantia,</em> i.e. more-than-substance, etc. Similarly, when we say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the "Creator" of all things we should understand that predicate in a sense altogether distinct from the meaning which we attach to the predicate "maker" or "producer" when applied to finite agents or causes. The "creation" of the world is in reality a <em>theophania,</em> or showing forth of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">Essence of God</a> in the things created. Just as He reveals Himself to the mind and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and spiritual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so He reveals Himself to the senses in the created world around us. Creation is, therefore, a process of unfolding of the Divine Nature, and if we retain the word <em>Creator</em> in the sense of "one who makes things out of nothing", we must understand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "makes" the world out of His own Essence, which, because of its incomprehensibility, may be said to be "nothing".

<p>(2) Nature in the second sense, "Nature which creates and is created", is the world of primordial causes, or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which the Father "created" in the Son, and which in turn "create", that is determine the generic and specific natures of concrete visible things. These, says Eriugena, were called "prototypes", <em>theia thelemata</em>, and "ideas", by the Greeks. Their function is that of exemplar and efficient causes. For since they are, though created, identical with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since their <em>locus</em> is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the Second Person of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, they are operative causes and not merely static types. They are coeternal with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. From this, however, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to infer, as some critics have done, that according to Eriugena the primordial causes are identical with the Word. As examples of primordial causes Eriugena enumerates <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> (insight), understanding, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, greatness, power, etc. These are united in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, partly separate or scattered in the Word, and fully separate or scattered in the world of phenomena. For there is underlying all Eriugena's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the origin of things the image to which he often referred, namely, that of a circle, the radii of which are united at the centre. The centre is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the radii at a point near the centre are the primordial causes, the radii at the circumference are phenomena.

<p>(3) These phenomena are "Nature" in the third sense, "which is created and does not create". The stream of reality, setting out from the centre, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, passing through the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in the Word, passes next through all the <em>genera suprema, media, and infima</em> of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, then enters the region of number and the realm of space and time, where the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> become subject to multiplicity, change, imperfection, and decay. In this last stage they are no longer pure <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> but only the appearances of reality, that is phenomena. In the region of number the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> become <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, pure incorporeal spirits. In the realm of space and time the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> take on the burden of matter, which is the source of suffering, sickness, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The material world, therefore, of our experience is composed of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> clothed in matter &mdash; here Eriugena attempts a reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> with <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> notions. Man, too, is composed of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and matter, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. He is the culmination of the process of things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with him, as we shall see, begins the process of return of all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is the image of the Trinity in so far as he unites in one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being, wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. In the state of innocence in which he was created, he was perfect in body as well as in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, independent of bodily needs, and without differentiation of sex. The dependence of man's mind on the body and the subjection of the body to the world of sense, as well as the distinction of male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> in the human kind, are all the results of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. This downward tendency of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards the conditions of animal existence has only one remedy, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. By means of this heavenly gift man is enabled to rise superior to the needs of the sensuous body, to place the demands of reason above those of bodily <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>, and from reason to ascend through contemplation to <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and thence by <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. The three faculties here alluded to as reason, contemplation, and <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> are designated by Eriugena as internal sense (<em>dianoia</em>), ratiocination (<em>logos</em>), and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>nous</em>). These are the three degrees of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> perfection which man must attain if he is to free himself from the bondage into which he was cast by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and attain that union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in which <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consists.

<p>(4) Not only man, however, but everything else in nature is destined to return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This universal resurrection of nature is the subject of the last portion of Eriugena's work, in which he treats of "Nature which neither creates nor is created". This is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the final Term, or Goal, of all existence. When Christ became man, He took on Himself body, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, senses, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and when, <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into Heaven</a>, He took these with Him, not only the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man but his senses, his body, the animal and the vegetative natures, and even the elements were redeemed, and the final return of all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was begun. Now, as Heraclitus taught, the upward and the downward ways are the same. The return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> proceeds in the inverse order through all the steps which marked the downward course, or process of things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The elements become light, light becomes life, life becomes sense, sense becomes reason, reason becomes <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> becomes <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in Christ, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and through Christ returns to the oneness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from which all the processes of nature began. This "incorporation" in Christ takes place by means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which Christ is the invisible head. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the final return of all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shows very clearly the influence of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. In general, the system of thought just outlined is a combination of <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, emanationism, and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> which Eriugena strove in vain to reconcile with <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> empiricism, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> creationism, and theism. The result is a body of doctrines loosely articulated, in which the mystic and idealistic elements predominate, and in which there is much that is irreconcilable with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>.
<h2>Influence</h2>

<p>Eriugena's influence on the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> thought of his own and immediately subsequent generations was doubtless checked by the condemnations to which his doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and of the Eucharist were subjected in the Councils of Valencia (855), Langres (859), and <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> (1050). The general trend of his thought, so far as it was discernible at the time of his translations of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, was referred to with suspicion in a letter addressed by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> to Charles the Bald in 859. It was not, however, until the beginning of the thirteenth century that the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> of the "De Divisione Naturae" was formally condemned. The Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1225) coupled the condemnation of Eriugena's work with the previous condemnations (1210) of the <a href="../cathen/01379b.htm">doctrines of Amalric of Chartres</a> and <a href="../cathen/04645a.htm">David of Dinant</a>, and there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the pantheists of that time were using Eriugena's treatise. While the great <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> teachers, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, apparently, of Eriugena and his <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, certain groups of mystical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, even as early as the thirteenth century, were interested in his work and drew their doctrines from it. The <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, too, sought inspiration from him. Later, the Mystics, especially <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckhart</a>, were influenced by him. And in recent times the great <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">transcendental</a> idealists, especially the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, recognize in him a kindred spirit and speak of him in the highest terms.
