<h1>John Sergeant</h1>  

<p>Born at Barrow-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, in 1623; died in 1710, not, as <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a> asserts, in 1707 (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> "Obituary of the Old Chapter"). He was son of William Sergeant, a yeoman, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1642-3. Being appointed secretary to Bishop Morton of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, he was employed in patristic and historical researches which resulted in his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He then went to the English College, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (24 February, 1650). He taught humanities till 1652, when he became <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> and prefect of studies. In 1653 he was recalled to the English mission, where he made many converts; but the year following he returned to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> to resume his former offices and to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In 1655 the chapter, recognizing his unusual ability, elected him a canon and appointed him secretary. For the next twenty years he was actively engaged in controversy with Stillingfleet, Tillotson, and other <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> divines, also with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who opposed the views of <a href="../cathen/15613c.htm">Thomas Blacklow</a>. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">Oates Plot</a> he entered into communication with the Privy Council, which greatly <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but some of the incidents which happened suggest that his mind was unbalanced at the time. He avoided arrest by passing as a physician under the names of <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and Smith. His peculiar temperament, which always made him difficult to work with, increased in his later years, and he fell into a state of nervous irritation, saying and writing things which caused great offence and pain, even to his friends. He was a voluminous writer, leaving over fifty works, either published or in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> His chief writings are: "Schism Disarm'd" (Paris, 1655); "Schism Dispatcht" (1657); "Vindication of Benedict XII.'s Bull" (Paris, 1659); "Reflections upon the Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance" (1661); "Statera Appensa" (London, 1661); "Tradidi Vobis" (London, 1662); "Sure-Footing in Christianity" (London, 1665); a system of controversy, for which he was attacked by <a href="../cathen/14432c.htm">Peter Talbot</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and in defence of which Sergeant wrote several pamphlets; "Solid Grounds of the Roman Catholic Faith" (1666); "Faith Vindicated" (Louvain, 1667); "Reason against Raillery" (1672); "Error Non-plust" (1673); "Methodus Compendiosa" (Paris, 1674); "Clypeus Septemplex" (Paris, 1677), a defence of his own teaching; a series of "Catholic Letters" in reply to Stillingfleet (London, 1687-8); "Method to Science" (London, 1696); a series of works against <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> philosophy, "Ide&aelig; Cartesian&aelig;" (London, 1698); "Non Ultra" (London, 1698); "raillery by Calm Reason" (London, 1699); "Abstract of the Transactions relating to the English Secular Clergy" (London, 1706); other pamphlets relating to the chapter, some of which, with replies thereto, were suppressed by the orders of the chapter. There is an original <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at the English College, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>.
