<h1>John Sobieski</h1>  

<p>Born at Olesko in 1629; died at Wilanow, 1696; son of James, Castellan of Cracow and descended by his mother from the heroic <a href="../cathen/15763b.htm">Zolkiewski</a>, who died in battle at Cecora. His elder brother Mark was his companion in arms from the time of the great Cossack rebellion (1648), and fought at Zbaraz, Beresteczko, and lastly at Batoh where, after being taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Tatars. John, the last of all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, accompanied Czarniecki in the expedition to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>; then, under George Lubomirski, he fought the Muscovites at Cudnow. Lubomirski revolting, he remained faithful to the king (John Casimir), became successively Field Hetman, Grand Marshal, and &#151; after Revera Potocki's death &#151; Grand Hetman or Commander-in-chief. His first exploit as Hetman was in Podhajce, where, besieged by an army of Cossacks and Tatars, he at his own expense raised 8000 men and stored the place with wheat, baffling the foe so completely that they retired with great loss. When, in 1672, under Michael Wisniowiecki's reign, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> seized Kamieniec, Sobieski beat them again and again, till at the crowning victory of Chocim they lost 20,000 men and a great many guns. This gave <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> breathing space, and Sobieski became a national hero, so that, King Michael dying at that time, he was unanimously elected king in 1674. Before his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> he was forced to drive back the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> hordes, that had once more invaded the country; he beat them at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> in 1675, arriving in time to raise siege of Trembowla, and to save Chrzanowski and his heroic wife, its defenders. Scarcely <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, he hastened to fight in the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> provinces. Having too few soldiers (20,000) to attack the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who were ten to one, he wore them out, entrenching himself at Zurawno, letting the enemy hem him in for a fortnight, extricating himself with marvellous skill and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and finally regaining by treaty a good part of the Ukraine.

<p>For some time there was peace: the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> had learned to dread the "Unvanquished Northern Lion", and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, too was exhausted. But soon the Sultan turned his arms against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Passing through <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, a great part which had for one hundred and fifty years been in <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> hands, and enormous army, reckoned at from 210,000 to 300,000 men (the latter figures are Sobieski's) marched forward. The Emperor Leopold fled from <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and begged Sobieski's aid, which the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> also implored. Though dissuaded by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, whose policy was always hostile to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Sobieski hesitated not a instant. Meanwhile (July, 1683) the Grand Vizier Kara Mustapha, had arrived before <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and laid siege to the city, defended by the valiant Imperial General Count Stahremberg, with a garrison of only 15,000 men, exposed to the horrors of disease and fire, as well as to hostile attacks. Sobieski started to the rescue in August, taking his son James with him; passing by <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady's</a> sanctuary at Czefistochowa, the troops <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for a blessing on their arms; and in the beginning of September, having crossed the Danube and joined forces with the German armies under John George, Elector of Saxony, and Prince Charles of Lorraine, they approached <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. On 11 Sept., Sobieski was on the heights of Kahlenberg, near the city, and the next day he gave battle in the plain below, with an army of not more than 76,000 men, the German forming the left wing and the Poles under Hetmans Jahonowski and Sieniawski, with General Katski in command of the artillery, forming the right. The hussars charged with their usual impetuosity, but the dense masses of the foe were impenetrable. Their retreat was taken for flight by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who rushed forward in pursuit; the hussars turned upon them with reinforcements and charged again, when their shouts made known that the "Northern Lion" was on the field and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> fled, panic-stricken, with Sobieski's horsemen still in pursuit. Still the battle raged for a time along all the line; both sides fought <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a>, and the king was everywhere commanding, fighting, encouraging his men and urging them forward. He was the first to storm the camp: Kara Mustapha had escaped with his life, but he received the bow-string in Belgrade some months later. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were routed, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> saved, and the news sent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and along with the Standard of the Prophet, taken by Sobieski, who himself had heard Mass in the morning.

<p>Prostrate with outstretched arms, he declared that it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> cause he was fighting for, and ascribed the victory (Veni, vidi, Deus vicit &#151; his letter to <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>) to Him alone. Next day he entered <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, acclaimed by the people as their saviour. Leopold, displeased that the Polish king should have all the glory, condescended to visit and thank him, but treated his son James and the Polish hetmans with extreme and haughty coldness. Sobieski, though deeply offended, pursued the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> into <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, attacked and took Ostrzyhom after the a second battle, and returned to winter in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, with immense spoils taken in the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> camp. These and the glory shed upon the nation were all the immediate advantages of the great victory. The Ottoman danger had vanished forever. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> still went on: step by step the foe was driven back, and sixteen years later Kamieniec and the whole of Podolia were restored to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. But Sobieski did not live to see this triumph. In vain had he again and again attempted to retake Kamieniec, and even had built a stronghold to destroy its strategic value; this fortress enabled the Tatars to raid the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> provinces upon several occasions, even to the gates of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. He was also forced by treaty to give up Kieff to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1686; nor did he succeed in securing the crown for his son James. His last days were spent in the bosom of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at his castle of Wilanow, where he died in 1696, broken down by political strife as much as by illness. His wife, a Frenchwoman, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of John Zamoyski, Marie-Casimire, though not worthy of so great a hero, was tenderly beloved by him, as his letters show: she influenced him greatly and not always wisely. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is now extinct. Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, was his great-grandson &#151; his son James' daughter, Clementine, having married James Stuart in 1719.
