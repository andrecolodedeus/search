<h1>John T. Mullock</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. John's, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, born in 1807 at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; died at St. John's, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, 26 March, 1869. He became a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at St. Bonaventure's College, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, and at St. Isidore's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where in 1830 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After long service in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, particularly at Ennis, he was appointed in 1847 coadjutor to Bishop Fleming of St. John's, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, with the right of succession, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Cardinal Fransoni on 27 December, 1847, at St. Isidore's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In July, 1850, he succeeded Bishop Fleming. The church made great progress in Newfoundland during the episcopate of Dr. Mullock, a new diocese &mdash; Harbour Grace &mdash; being erected. The splendid <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. John's, begun in 1841, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 9 September, 1855. Dr. Mullock always took a keen interest in the commercial development of <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, and was most enthusiastic about its natural resources. He was frequently consulted by the governor on matters relating to the welfare of the colony, and many of his suggestions relating to the fisheries and other matters were adopted. Before leaving <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he was a frequent contributor to the periodical literature of the day, and took an active part in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> literary movement of the forties. Long before the first attempts to lay a submarine cable across the Atlantic was made (1857), Dr. Mullock had on several occasions publicly propounded the feasibility of connecting <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with America by means of submarine telegraph. He was the first to bring before the English-speaking world the life and works of the great <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">Saint Alphonsus Maria Liguori</a>, publishing his "Life" at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1846, and in the following year a translation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> "History of Heresies and their Refutation". In 1847 appeared at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> his "Short History of the Irish Franciscan Province" translated from the Latin work of Francis Ward; he also wrote "The Cathedral of St. John's, Newfoundland and its consecration" (Dublin, 1856).
