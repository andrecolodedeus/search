<h1>John Talaia</h1>  

<p>Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (481-482) at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> troubles. He had been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the Canopis and administrator (<em>megas oikonomos</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under the Patriarch Timothy Salofaciolus, who had sent him with Gennadius of Hermopolis as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the Emperor Zeno (474-491). Zeno was on very good terms with John Talaia, in whom every one foresaw the future <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (<a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, "H.E., " III, xii; <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix III</a>, Ep. i, 10, ii, 4, in Thiel, "Epist. Rom. Pont.," Braunsberg, 1867). It was said by his enemies that he was vain and ambitious, that he spent large sums of money in bribing courtiers and behaved as if he were already patriarch. He quarrelled with <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacius of Constantinople</a> (471-489) however, who became his implacable enemy. Acacius afterwards said that Talaia had sworn that he would not accept the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Just before his death, Timothy Salofaciolus again sent John Talaia to Constantinople with the petition that when he, Timothy, died he might have a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (Chalcedonian) successor. This time, too, Talaia enjoyed the Emperor's favour. Zeno promised all he asked and spoke with great admiration of Timothy's <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. But Talaia ignored Acacius, who shut himself up and awaited his chance of revenge. Talaia made friends among the courtiers, ingratiating himself especially with a certain Illus, administrator of the palace. As soon as Timothy died (481) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> chose John Talaia to succeed him. Unfortunately the new patriarch then offended the emperor and gave Acacius his chance. He announced his succession at once to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Antioch, according to custom. But he sent no announcement to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, only writing to Illus begging him to tell the emperor. Illus was away at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; so people at Constantinople heard the news before the official announcement arrived. This Zeno took as a personal affront. Acacius stepped in to take advantage of the situation. He persuaded Zeno that Talaia had broken his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in accepting election and had advised his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to restore the name of the great <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> champion, <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, to their <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. This accusation was sheer <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. Talaia was always unimpeachably <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. Zeno then refused to acknowledge Talaia and supported his rival <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> (<em>Moggos</em>, hoarse) was a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> who had already been set up as patriarch by his party when Timothy Ailuros died (477). During the life of Salofaciolus he had not made much headway; but now he was again brought forward by the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> as rival patriarch to Talaia. Acacius had formerly been an enemy of <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a>; now he and the emperor supported him. The situation was further complicated by the publication of the famous <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">"Henoticon"</a> (482), by which Zeno and Acacius hoped to conciliate the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">HENOTICON</a>). <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> accepted it at once, whereas Talaia rejected it. Zeno then wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Simplicius, 463-483), saying that Talaia was unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a>, being a <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurer</a> and friend of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, that <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> was the right man to be patriarch. A result of this letter was that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not at once acknowledge Talaia. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> answered the emperor, refusing to admit <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> as patriarch in any case. Zeno, however, ordered the governor (<em>dux</em>) of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to expel Talaia and establish <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> in his place. <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> then sent notice of his succession to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Constantinople. Acacius acknowledged him and inserted his name in the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. Talaia, expelled from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 483. He there explained the whole situation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and persuaded him to write two letters to Acacius denouncing <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a>. So also he was the adviser of the next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix II</a> (or III, 483-492), in the great controversy about <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">"Henoticon"</a> that led to the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> from this time became the great subject of dispute. Communion with him meant <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. John Talaia practically disappeared from the field. He stayed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> protection (always of course opposed to <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">"Henoticon"</a>) helping the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court with his advice and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Eastern affairs. Liberatus thinks he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nolana in the Campagna, <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> thinks this unlikely (Oriens Christ., IL 419). Under Gelasius 1 (492-496) Talaia's name still occurs as that of a counsellor whose advice the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> willingly followed. He was never able to go back to his own see and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at a <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown.

<p>It may be of interest to note that Paul Drews ("Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Kanons in der r&otilde;m. Messe," T&uuml;bingen, 1902) attributes the present arrangement of the Canon of the Mass in some measure to John Talaia of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. His thesis is this: Originally the order of the Canon corresponded to the Antiochene <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>. It was re-arranged in the fifth century to make it conform more or less to the Alexandrine Liturgy, most probably by Gelasius I by the advice of his influential guest (op. cit., p. 38).
