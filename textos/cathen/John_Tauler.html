<h1>John Tauler</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, one of the greatest mystics and preachers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> about 1300; died at the same place, 16 June, 1361. He was the son of a prosperous citizen of that city. Apparently while still a youth he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, because according to his own confession the ascetic life of the order attracted him. It is possible that while taking the customary eight-years' course of study at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> he heard <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart</a> preach. When a student at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of the order at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, he became more closely acquainted with <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart</a>. In the same way he probably came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Henry Suso</a> at Cologne. Whether he also studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> is uncertain; more probably he returned from Cologne to Strasburg. From about 1339 to 1347 or 1348 he lived at Basle where he and <a href="../cathen/07237a.htm">Henry of N&ouml;rdlingen</a> were the centre of the large <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> called the <a href="../cathen/06306a.htm">Friends of God of Basle</a>; these were <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who favoured the mystical life and who gave themselves this name from <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs15">John 15:15</a>. Tauler then returned to Strasburg where he laboured as a preacher. Christina Ebner praises his fiery tongue that kindled the entire world; Rulman Merswin chose him as confessor. Later he lived for some time at Cologne. During the last period of his life he was again at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>.

<p>The "Meisterbuch" of the "Friend of God of the Upland" gives an account of a master of the Scriptures who attracted great attention in 1346 by his preaching. One day a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> accused the master of seemingly seeking his own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> rather than that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying also that probably he had not himself borne the burdens he had laid upon others. Without making any stipulations the master allowed himself to be guided by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and learned from him to forget the world and himself, to turn all his thoughts upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to lead a life of the Spirit. For two years he lived in seclusion. When after this he preached again for the first time the effect was so great that forty of his hearers went into convulsions and twelve could hardly be revived. After the master had lived and laboured for nine years more he fell dangerously ill, and calling for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> gave him a written account of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. To this account the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> added five sermons of the master that he had copied. It was customary at an earlier date to regard Tauler as this master; and the "Meisterbuch" was from the year 1498 included in the editions of Tauler's sermons. In more recent times Preger has also supported this opinion. But in the treatise "Taulers Bekehrung" <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> has produced strong <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> against attributing to Tauler the r&ocirc;le of this master; this view is now generally maintained, The story told by the later Strasburg chronicler, Speckle (died 1589) is a tissue of falsehoods; it relates that Tauler opposed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had laid upon Strasburg in the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the Emperor Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>.

<p>Tauler's writings have not yet been subjected to a thorough critical investigation. Much that is attributed to him is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, much not genuine. He certainly did not write the book of the "Nachahmung des armen Lebens Christi" or "Von der geistlichen Armut". The "Exercitia super vita et passione Jesu Christi" and the spiritual songs attributed to him are also spurious. At the most he only wrote a small part of the "Medulla anim&aelig;" or of "Institutiones divin&aelig;". Only the sermons, therefore, remain as the actual works of Tauler. The first edition appeared in 1498 at Leipzig and includes 84 sermons; the second edition (Basle, 1521-22) added 42 more some of which, however, even in the opinion of the editor of the edition, were not Tauler's; in the third edition (Cologne, 1543) 25 new sermons were added, part of which are also spurious. The Cologne edition was translated into or rather paraphrased in, Latin by <a href="../cathen/14343c.htm">Laurentius Surius</a> (Cologne, 1548). This Latin edition was the copy used for translations into various foreign languages and for both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> retranslations into German. The modern editions (Frankfort, 1826, 1864, 1872; Berlin, 1841) are based on the old German editions. Lately, Ferdinand Vetter has prepared an edition (Berlin, 1910) based on the Engelberg <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (the only one made at Cologne and the oldest one that may perhaps represent the collection revised by Tauler himself) also on the Freiburg <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, and on copies of the three <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> burned at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in 1870. This edition contains 81 sermons. The sermons are among the finest monuments of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>, of German fervour of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and of profound spiritual feeling. The language is quiet and measured, yet warm, animated, and full of imagery. Tauler is not so speculative as his teacher <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart</a> but he is clearer, more practical, and more adapted to the common people; with all this he united <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso's</a> fervour. The expression used by Christina Ebner, that he had set the whole world aflame by his fiery tongue, does not mean that he was a preacher of fiery, entrancing eloquence, but a preacher who warmed and inflamed the hearts of his hearers by the quiet flame of the pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that burned in his own breast.

<p>The centre of Tauler's <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>visio essenti&oelig; Dei</em>, the blessed contemplation or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine nature. He takes this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, but goes further than the latter in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is attainable in this world also by a perfect man, and should be sought by every means. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwells within each human being. In order, however, that the transcendent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may appear in man as a second subject, the human, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> activities must cease. Aid is given in this effort by the light of grace which raises nature far above itself. The way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> replies to its highest development by His presence. Tauler gives advice of the most varied character for attaining that height of religion in which the Divine enters into the human subject. Something needs to be said as regards Tauler's position towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> praised him greatly and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have always had a very high opinion of him, and have included him among the "reformers before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>". However it is now conceded by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that he was "in reality entirely medi&aelig;val and not <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>". He was in fact a dutiful son of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and never thought of withdrawing his allegiance. He expresses his opinion very plainly in his sermon on St. Matthew. He set his face against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, especially that of the Brethren of the Free Spirit. What attracted <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was probably not Tauler's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself, but only here and there some subordinate thought. Perhaps it pleased him that the word <em><a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a></em> appears only once in Tauler's sermons, or it aroused his sympathy that Tauler laid less stress upon works, or again he was attracted by the tremendous earnestness of this seeker after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
