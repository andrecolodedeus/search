<h1>John Thayer</h1>  

<p>Missionary, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a>, first native of New England <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, b. <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Mass.</a>, 1755; d. in <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 5 February, 1815. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were among the early <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> settlers of New England and all during his career he manifested much of their stern unbending character. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at Yale, he became a Congregationalist minister and as such served during the Revolutionary War as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of a company organized for the defence of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> and of which John Hancock was commander. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he wandered over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the beggar-saint Benedict Joseph Labre died. An attempt he made to dispute some of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought through Blessed Labre's [<em>Editor's note</em>: <a href="../cathen/02442a.htm">St. Benedict Joseph Labre</a> was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in 1883] intercession resulted in Thayer's conversion to the Faith, 25 May, 1783. His own account of this conversion, one of the first of prominent New England <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, was printed in 1787 and reissued in several editions in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. It was also translated into French and Spanish, and created a great controversial sensation at the time. Ambitious to convert his non-Catholic fellow- countrymen, he then took a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course under the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1789. He returned to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the following year and was put in charge of the newly organized <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> but soon failed as a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> because of his erratic and contentious temper. He left <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1799, and ministered for a very short time at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, whence he went to Kentucky as a missionary. Here he remained for four years, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, however, not compensating for his lack of policy and his infirmity of temperament. His wandering inclinations carried him across the ocean again in 1803 and he finally settled down in <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he died, locally esteemed as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of edifying <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and ascetic life. The remainder of his small private fortune, with some gifts he had collected, he left by will to found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. Inspired by this wish the three daughters of a merchant named James Ryan, with whom he lived in <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1819) and there founded the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Community, whose <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, Mount Benedict, near Bunker Hill, Charlestown, was burned and sacked by an anti-Catholic mob on the night of 11 August, 1834.
