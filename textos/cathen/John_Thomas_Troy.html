<h1>John Thomas Troy</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>; b. in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Blanchardstown, near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 10 May, 1739; d. at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 11 May, 1823. He belonged to an Anglo-Norman stock, and received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Liffey Street, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, after which, in 1777 [This is probably a typo for 1757 or 1767 &mdash; <em>Ed.</em>], he joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> and proceeded to their house of <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Amenable to discipline, diligent in his studies, and gifted with much ability, he made rapid progress, and while yet a student was selected to give lectures in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Subsequently he professed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and canon law, and finally became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in 1772. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a> died, in 1776, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> recommended one of their number, Father Molloy, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the vacant see, and the recommendation was endorsed by many of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But Dr. Troy, who was held in high esteem at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had already been appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>. He arrived at Kilkenny in August, and for the next nine years he laboured hard for the spiritual interests of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. They were troubled times. Maddened by excessive rents and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and harried by grinding tithe-proctors, the farmers had banded themselves together in a <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret society</a> called the "Whiteboys". Going forth at night, they attacked landlords, bailiffs, agents, and tithe-proctors, and often committed fearful outrages. Bishop Troy grappled with them and frequently and sternly denounced them. It was not that he had any sympathy with oppression, but he had lived so long in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and had left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at such an early age, that he did not quite understand the condition of things at home, and did not fully appreciate the extent of misery and oppression in which the poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> masses lived.

<p>The bent of his mind was to support authority, and he was therefore ready to condemn all violent efforts for reform, and had no hesitation in denouncing not only all <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but also "our American fellow-subjects, seduced by specious notions of liberty". This made him unpopular with the masses, but there could be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in correcting abuses in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and in promoting <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. So well was this recognized at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that in 1781, in consequence of some serious troubles which had arisen between the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Dr. Troy was appointed Administrator of Armagh. This office he held till 1782. In 1786 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. At Dublin, as at <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, he showed his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion, his sympathy with authority, and his distrust of popular movements, especially when violent means were employed; in 1798 he issued a sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against all those of his flock who would join the rebellion. He was also one of the most determined supporters of the Union. In 1799 he agreed to accept the veto of government on the appointment of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and even when the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, finding that they had been tricked by Pitt and Castlereagh, repudiated the veto, Dr. Troy continued to favour it. The last years of his life were uneventful.
