<h1>John Wessel Goesport</h1>  

<p>(GANSFORT).

<p>A fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at Gr&ouml;ningen in 1420; died there on 4 Oct., 1489. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Zwolle and lived in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brothers of the Common Life</a>. From 1449 he studied at the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a>, and graduated <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master of arts</a> there. In 1456-7 he was temporary professor of arts at the <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">University of Heidelberg</a>. About the beginning of 1458 he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, intending to induce two celebrated teachers from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, then lecturing at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to change from Formalism to Realism, which he advocated <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a>. He himself, however, was converted to Formalism, and then adopted <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, to which he afterwards adhered. His stay at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> lasted probably until 1473; He left very likely because of the edict issued in that year by Louis XI against <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>. He then spent some time in 1474 at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and apparently at Basle, after which he returned home and devoted himself in quiet to learning. He spent the greater part of his last years alternately in several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Though he remained a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, he was interested mainly in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions. A selection from his writings, "Farrago rerum theologicarum", was issued at Zwolle, probably in 1521 (reprint at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 1522, and Basle, 1522, this latter containing a commendatory preface by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>). The Basle edition included several letters to and from Wessel. Shortly after 1521 Wessel published at Zwolle: "De sacramento Eucharisti&aelig; et audienda missa"; "De oratione et modo orandi"; "De causis incarnationis". A complete edition of his works appeared at Gr&ouml;ningen in 1614, with a biographical sketch by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preacher Albert Hardenberg.

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> usually regard Wessel as a precursor of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. The first publication of the "Farrago rerum theologicarum" was the work of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who presented in it a collection of extracts which seemed to favour <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. This judgment, maintained in modern times by Ullmann, is one-sided and exaggerates Wessel's deviations from the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. True his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> contains dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, some of which were later taught by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He denies the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">office of teaching</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a> and the ecumenical councils. He disputes the right of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors to give commands that bind under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He emphasizes too strongly the subjective activity of the faithful in sharing the fruits of Communion and of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> (<em>opus operantis</em>), so that the objective working of the sacrament (<em>opus operatum</em>) seems to be impaired. In the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> he acknowledges the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, but denies its judicial character. He rejects satisfaction as a part of the sacrament, holding that with the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the temporal punishment is also remitted. He regards an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> as a merely external release from canonical punishments and censures; in his opinion, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> serves not to punish temporally <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remitted in this world, but only to purify <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from inordinate desires, and from venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Yet in those points which touch the fundamental doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, Wessel stands entirely on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ground. He teaches the freedom of the will, justification not by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone but by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> active in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the meritorious character of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> as formed by the Scriptures and Tradition; he acknowledges the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the efficacy of the Sacraments <em>ex opere operato</em>, <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the sacrificial character of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and holds firmly to the veneration of the Blessed Virgin. Such being the character of his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, he cannot be regarded as a precursor of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. He never thought of separating from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and he died a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. During his lifetime he was never taken to task by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. In the sixteenth century his writings, however, were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index of forbidden books</a> on account of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>.
