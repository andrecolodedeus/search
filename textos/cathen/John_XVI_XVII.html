<h1>John XVI (XVII)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">Antipope</a> 997-998; d. probably in 1013. After the death of <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a>, Bruno, a relative of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, was raised through the royal influence to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on 3 May, 996. On 21 May the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> placed the imperial crown on the young King <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After Otto's departure the <em>patricius</em> Crescentius and his followers rose against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and in September, 996, drove him out of the city. In the following May (997) Archbishop John Philagathus of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, who had returned shortly before from a mission to Constantinople whither he had been sent by <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> by Crescentius. John was a native of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a> in Calabria, at that time a part of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. He became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and was closely connected with Empress Theophano, through whose influence he received the Abbey of Nonantola from <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>. He was the godfather of the imperial Prince Otto, afterwards emperor. After the death of <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> he remained the trusted adviser of the empress dowager who, in 988, promoted him to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">See of Piacenza</a>, raised for him to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, though later restored to its original rank. At the court of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> he retained his influential position. The king sent him at the end of 995 to Constantinople to arrange a matrimonial alliance between the sovereign and a Byzantine princess. Notwithstanding this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of favour on the part of the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, John allowed himself on his return from Constantinople to be won over to the projects of Crescentius, who wished through him to bring about an alliance with Byzantium against the German Emperor. <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and a compatriot of John, sought to dissuade him from the usurpation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, but without avail.

<p>At the Synod of Pavia held by <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> at Pentecost, 997, Crescentius was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and in July the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> bringing <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> once more under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In the following winter <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the head of an army, and in February, 998, entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> fled, and Crescentius entrenched himself in the Castle of Sant' Angelo. John XVI was captured by the imperial soldiers, deprived of his sight, and, his nose and ears having been mutilated, was brought in this condition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the Lenten Synod of 998, held shortly after in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> formally deposed the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, who, at the intercession of <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a>, was removed from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. When, in spite of all this, John again appeared before <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory</a> in episcopal robes, these were torn from him, and he was led through the streets of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on an ass amid the popular derision. According to the unreliable "Vita" of <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a>, he was thrown back into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; while other sources relate that he was again confined in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where he died. The "Annales Fuldenses" record his death under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 2 April, 1013. At <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 998, <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> took the Castle of Sant' Angelo, and on 29 April Crescentius was beheaded.
