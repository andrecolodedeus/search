<h1>John de Feckenham</h1>  

<p>Last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Westminster, and confessor of the Faith; b. in Feckenham Forest, Worcestershire, in 1515(?), of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> named Howman; d. at Wisbech Castle, 16 Oct., 1585. He became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a>, and studied at Gloucester Hall, Oxford (B. D., 11 June, 1539), returned to <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a> to teach junior <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> till the dissolution, 27 Jan., 1540, when he received a pension of 15 marks. Rector of Solihull, Worcestershire (1544?-1554), he became known as an orator and controversialist. He was domestic <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Bishop Bell of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> till 1543, and then to <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bonner</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> till 1549. He was sent to the Tower by Cranmer for defending the Faith, but in 1551 was "borrowed out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>" to hold public disputations with the new men, e.g. with Jewel and Hooper. Again relegated to the Tower, he was released by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, 5 Sept., 1553, and was much employed as a preacher in London; he was advanced to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and in March, 1554, made dean of St. Paul's. He showed great mildness to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, many of whom he converted, and saved others from the stake. He prepared Lady Jane Grey for death, though he could not convince her of her <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, as he did Sir John Cheke, the king's tutor. Feckenham interceded for Elizabeth after Wyatt's rebellion, obtaining her life and subsequent release. He took the degree of D. D. at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, May, 1556, and on 7 Sept., 1556, was appointed <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the royal Abbey of Westminster, restored to the order by the queen. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> took possession on 21 November (since known as <em>dies memorabilis</em>), and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was installed on 29 November, beginning his rule over a community of about twenty- eight, gathered from the dissolved <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. He successfully defended in Parliament, 11 Feb., 1557, the threatened privileges of sanctuary, and restored the shrine of the Confessor in his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church.

<p>Elizabeth at her accession offered (November, 1558) to preserve the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> if he and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> would accept the new religion, but Feckenham steadily refused, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> and eloquently defending the old Faith in Parliament and denouncing the sacrilegious innovations of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. He gave sanctuary to <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bishop Bonner</a>, and quietly went on planting trees while awaiting the expulsion, which took place 12 July, 1559. He generously resigned a large part of the money due him to the dean who succeeded him. Nevertheless, in May, 1560, he was sent to the Tower "for railing against the changes that had been made". Three years later he was given into the custody of Horne, the intruded <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, but in 1564 he was sent back to the Tower, his episcopal jailer having failed to pervert him. Feckenham himself said that he preferred the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to the pseudo-bishop's palace. In 1571 he prepared his fellow-prisoner, <a href="../cathen/08485b.htm">Blessed John Storey</a>, for death, and a little later was sent to the Marshalsea. In the Tower he and his fellow-confessors had been "haled by the arms to Church in violent measure, against our wills, there to hear a sermon, not of persuading us but of railing upon us." He was released on bail, 17 July, 1574, after fourteen years' confinement, and lived in Holborn, where he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. He encouraged boys in manly sports on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, preferring that they should practise archery rather than attend the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> services. But falling ill, he was permitted to go to Bath, where in 1576 he built a hospice for poor patients and did much good. But his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Faith excited fresh rancour, and in 1577 he was committed to the custody of Cox, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, who was requested to bring him to conformity. Feckenham's so-called "Confession" (British Museum, Lansdowne <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, No. 30, fol. 199) shows how egregiously Cox failed, and in 1580 he petitioned the council to remove the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, who was accordingly sent to Wisbech Castle, a dismal <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> belonging to the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, which he shared with Watson, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, and other confessors. Here he died a holy death, fortified by the Sacred <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, and was buried in Wisbech Church. He was worn out by an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of twenty- three years for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience'</a> sake; a striking example of Elizabeth's ingratitude. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers unite in praising his virtues, especially his kindness of heart, gentleness, and charity to the poor. Even Burnet calls him "a charitable and generous man". His best-known work is against Herne, "The Declaration of such Scruples and Stays of Conscience touching the Oath of Supremacy", etc. He also wrote "Caveat Emptor", a caution against buying <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands, and a commentary on the Psalms, but these are lost.
