<h1>John de Lugo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, one of the most eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of modern times, b. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, November, 1583, though he used to call himself "Hispalensis", because his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> seat was at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 20 August, 1660. Both his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, John de Lugo, and his mother, Teresa de Quiroga, whose family name he bore for a time, as was custom for the second son, were of noble birth. Such was de Lugo's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> precocity that at the age of three years he could read printed or written books; at ten, he received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>; at fourteen he defended a public thesis in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, and at about the same time was appointed by Philip II to an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> which he retained until his solemn profession in 1618. Like his elder brother <a href="../cathen/09418a.htm">Francis</a>, he was sent be his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; but <a href="../cathen/09418a.htm">Francis</a> having entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> where he became a distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, John soon desired to imitate him and, having vainly asked his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> permission, in two letters, entered without it in 1603. After completing his studies he was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Medina del Campo, in 1611, and later of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where he taught for five years. His fame as a professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> attracted the attention of the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/15486d.htm">Mutius Vitelleschi</a>, and de Lugo was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he arrived early in June, 1621.

<p>The teaching of de Lugo at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was brilliant; his lectures even before being printed were spread by copyists in other countries. When the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> ordered him to print his works, he obeyed and without help had the material for the first three volumes prepared within five years (1633, 1636, 1638). When the fourth volume, "De justitia et jure", was about to be published, his superiors thought it proper that he should dedicate it to <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>; he had to present it himself to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was so much surprised and delighted by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian's</a> learning that he frequently consulted him, and in 1643, created him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. This put an end to de Lugo's teaching; but several of his works were published after 1643. As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, he took part in the congregations of the Holy Office, of the Council, etc., and often had occasion to place his learning at the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He died age seventy-seven, being assisted by Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini, one of his most devoted disciples, also a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. According to his wish, he was buried near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Ignatius that "his heart might rest where his treasure was", as is said in his epitaph. De Lugo was a man not only of great learning, but also of great virtue; obedience alone induced him to publish his works, and he always retained the simplicity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> which had led him to refuse, but for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> order, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> dignity; the fine carriage sent by Cardinal Barberini to bring him as a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> palace, he called his hearse. His generosity to the poor was very great, and although his income was small, he daily distributed among them bread, money, and even remedies, such as quinquina, then newly discovered, which the people at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> used for a time to call Lugo's powder.

<p>The works of John de Lugo, some of which have never been printed, cover nearly the whole field of moral and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. The first volume, "De Incarnatione Domini" (Lyons, 1633), of which the short preface is well worth reading to get an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of de Lugo's method, came out in 1633. It was followed by "De sacramentis in genere;" "De Venerabili Eucharisti&aelig; Sacramento et de sacrosancto Miss&aelig; sacrificio" (Lyons, 1636); "De Virtute et Sacramento poenitenti&aelig;, de Suffragiis et Indulgentiis" (Lyons, 1638); and "De justitia et jure" (Lyon, 1642), the work on which de Lugo's fame especially rests. In composition of this important treatise, he was greatly aided by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of law acquired in his younger days at Salamanca, and it was this work which he dedicated and presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in person and which may be said to have gained for him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. De Lugo wrote to other works: "De virtuto fidei divin&aelig;" (Lyon, 1646), and "Responsorum morialum libri sex" (Lyon, 1651), published by his former pupil and friend, Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini. In these six books de Lugo gives, after thorough discussion, the solution of many difficult cases in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>; this work has a very high value both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, as in the main it consists of questions proposed to him for solutions over long years. The seventh volume, "De Deo, de Angelis, de Actibus humanis et de Gratia" (Cologne, 1716), was published over fifty years after the author's death; the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, as we find it expressed on the title page, was to complete his printed course of lectures. Other works on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and especially on philosophy: "De Anima", "Philosophia", "Logica", "De Trinitate", "De Visione Dei", etc. are still preserved in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, Salamanca, Karlsruhe, <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, etc.

<p>Among the unprinted works, the analysis of Arnauld's book, "De frequenti Communione" and the "Memorie del conclave d'Innocenzo X: Riposta al discorso . . . che gcorone hanno jus d'eschiudere li cardinali del Pontificato" may be of special interest; they are the only controversial works of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>. What he intended in his writings was not to give a long treatise, exhaustive from every point of view; he wished only "to open up a small river, to the ocean", without relating what others had said before him and without giving a series of opinions of previous writers or furnishing authors or quotations in number; he aimed at adding what he had found from his own reflection and deep meditation on each subject. Other important features of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conceptions are the union he always maintains between moral and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, the latter being the support of the former, and the same treatment being applied to both, discussing thoroughly the principle on which the main points of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> rest. From this point of view the last lines of his preface "De justitia et jure", are instructive.

<p>All his writings, whether on dogmatic or <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, exhibit two main qualities: A penetrating, critical mind, sometimes indulging a little too much in subtleties, and a sound judgment. He may be ranked among the best representatives of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> revival of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The small river which he wished to open, is indeed among the most important which empties into the ocean of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, so that in many dogmatic or moral questions, the opinion of de Lugo is of preponderating value. In several problems he formed a system of his own, as for instance about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the Eucharist, the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, etc., and owing to the thorough discussion of the question at issue, his opinion is always to be taken into account. In <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> he put an end, as Ballerini remarks, to several disputed questions. <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus de Ligouri</a> does not hesitate to rank him immediately after <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, "post S. Thomam facile princeps", and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> calls him "a light of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". Two complete editions of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo's</a> work were published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1718 and 1751, each edition containing seven volumes. Another edition (Paris, 1768) was never completed. The last edition is that of Fournials (1868-69), in seven volumes, of which an eighth volume with the "Responsa moralia" and the "Indices" was added in 1891.
