<h1>John de Montmirail</h1>  

<p>(MONTE-MIRABILI)

<p>Son of Andrew, Lord of Montmirail and Fert&eacute;-Gaucher, and Hildiarde d'Oisy, born in 1165; died 29 Sept., 1217. He was trained in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by his mother, and well instructed in the secular <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Whilst young he embraced a military career, and was presented at the Royal Court, where he formed a lasting friendship with <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, later King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The dissipations of court life led him to neglect the training of his youth; even his marriage with a most estimable lady, Helvide de Dampierre, failed to effect a change for the better. However, in his thirtieth year he met Jobert, Prior of St-Etienne de Montmirail, whose words of counsel <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> sufficient to cause his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>; and he turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with generosity and fidelity. He built an <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for the sick of all kinds, but the objects of his predilection were the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and those hopelessly afflicted. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the poor as brothers, and provided for them. He was severe on himself, wearing a coarse hair-shirt, passing frequently entire nights in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Not satisfied with a life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the world, nor with that of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>, which he tried for a while, he entered the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Longpont, after having distributed amongst the poor all his possessions not needed by his wife and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; and he gave himself wholly to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, so much so that he had to be reprimanded for going to excess. He had to bear every kind of insult from his former friends; even members of his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> abused him for having abandoned <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and wealth for poverty and subjection. But none of these things could weaken the fervor with which he sought perfection. Innumerable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and attract <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> even to the present day. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> granted a special office in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a>.
