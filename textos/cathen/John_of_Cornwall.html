<h1>John of Cornwall</h1>  

<p>(JOHANNES CORNUBIENSIS, JOHANNES DE SANCTO GERMANO).

<p>John of Cornwall lived about 1176. He was the author of a treatise written against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, "Eulogium ad Alexandrum Papam III, quod Christus sit aliquis homo". Scarcely anything is known of his life except the few facts to which he alludes by chance in this work. Though he is claimed by some French writers as a Bas-Breton, it appears <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> from the varied forms of his name that he was a native of St. German's in Cornwall. He was a student under <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> and Robert of Melum at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and subsequently became a teacher himself. From <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> he seems to have derived the view which that scholar held for a time, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity was but the vesture or garment wherewith the Logos was clothed; but he abandoned this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which was condemned at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> held by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> in 1163, and advocated the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teaching. In support of this he wrote the "Eulogium", though not for many years after the council, since a reference in the preface to William, formerly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, as being then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, shows that it could not have been written before 1176, in which year the translation took place. It was first published by Mart&egrave;ne in the "Thesaurus novus anecdotum" (Paris, 1717), and is reprinted in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXCIX. This is the only work which was certainly written by him. The "Apologia de Christi Incarnatione", usually attributed to <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, has been assigned to John without sufficient grounds, as also a treatise "Summa qualiter fiat Sacramentum Altaris per virtutem sanctae crucis et de septem canonibus vel ordinibus Missae" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L. CLXXVII). There is at Magdalen College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, a "Commentarius in Aristotelis libros duo analyticorum posteriorum", which may be his, and the Latin hexameters "Merlini prophetia cum expositione", written at the request of Bishop Warelwast of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, have been ascribed to him by reason of the references to Cornwall it contains. Nothing is known of his death, nor can he be identified with the John of Cornwall who was <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> in 1197.
