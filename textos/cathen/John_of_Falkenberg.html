<h1>John of Falkenberg</h1>  

<p>Author, b. at Falkenberg, <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; d. about 1418 in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> &mdash; or, according to other accounts, in his native town. Of his early life little is known, save that he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> and spent his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Kammin, a town of the above-named province. The fact that he was a master in Sacred Theology indicates that for a number of years he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in his order. His prominence in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval history</a> is due partly to the share he took in the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> which wrought such confusion in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the first part of the fifteenth century, but chiefly to his involving himself in the long-standing troubles between the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> of Knights of Livonia and the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In opposition to the general of his order, Bernard de Datis, and to many of the brethren of his province who were firm adherents of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> and <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, he was a strong and ardent adherent of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and, being of a quick and passionate temperament, he carried his opposition so far as to refuse publicly in the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> to acknowledge Bernard as his superior. In the protracted and disastrous conflict between the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> of Knights and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> on the one side and King Wladislaw of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Duke Withold of Lithuania on the other, his sympathies for the former found expression in a book in which he undertook to show that the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and his adherents were <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolators</a> and unbelievers and that the opposition against them was noble and praiseworthy. In this violent work he maintained the principles of the licitness of <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a>, advocated by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Jean Petit: that it was lawful to kill the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and his associates (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Conc." XXVII, 765). A little later he wrote "Tres tractatuli" (given as appendix to the works of <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> in the edition of Dupin, V, 1013-32) in justification of his position and against <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, d'Ailly, and other <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, who had condemned the works of Jean Petit. In this work, moreover, he denied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to declare his book or any part of it <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, claiming that in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> alone are <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. By order of Nicolaus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, Falkenberg was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The committee appointed to examine the work recommended that it be burned. A similar verdict was given by a chapter of his order assembled at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> from 30 May to June, 1417 which besides condemned the author to life <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. The Poles earnestly demanded the condemnation of Falkenberg by the council, but in vain. When finally in the forty-fifth (last) session they attempted to force <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> to give a definitive sentence, he imposed silence on their representatives and declared that in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in this particular matter he would approve only what had been decided by the general council <em>conciliariter</em>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> took Falkenberg with him and kept him for several years in close confinement. Whether he eventually regained his liberty or died there is uncertain.
