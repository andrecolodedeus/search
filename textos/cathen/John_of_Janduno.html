<h1>John of Janduno</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and political writer of the fourteenth century. John of Janduno (Johannes de Genduno, de Ganduno, and de Gandavo) and John of Gand (or less correctly, of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>) are now generally said to have been two different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The former was born about the year 1300, graduated in arts at the College of Navarre (<a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>), wrote a work entitled "De Laudibus Parisiis," and, in collaboration with <a href="../cathen/09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a>, composed the celebrated "Defensor pacis," directed against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>, for which the authors were condemned in 1327. John of Gand was born about 1270 or 1280, studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and after having served as <em>cur&eacute;</em> at Kieldrecht was made a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. These facts seem to be clearly established. However, there are extant a number of works, mostly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, which are ascribed to Johannes de Genduno, Ganduno, or Gandavo, and it is difficult to say whether they were written by John of Janduno or by John of Gand.

<p>These works include commentaries on <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard's</a> "Books of Sentences," on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Physics," "Metaphysics," and "The Soul," also a treatise entitled "Quaestio in Averroem de substantia orbis." The author is strongly inclined towards the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>. He defends the principle of twofold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to which what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or vice versa. Thus, he says, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the world is demonstrated in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and yet in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> it is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>; according to this principle, we are to believe that the world was made, while we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was not made. Again, he holds the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there is only one <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which is common to all men, and is in no sense a part of the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently, he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to maintain that the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In his discussion of the nature and operations of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> he takes sides with the determinists, who deny that the will is free. Finally, the Averroist author of these commentaries is no friend of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He tries to belittle the reputation of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and to prove him inferior to <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>. Considering, therefore, the spirit and tendency of these works, one is inclined to assign them to the turbulent, anti-papal author of the "Defensor pacis," and not to the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and canon who, for all we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, troubled himself as little about the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> going on between <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroists</a> as he did about the political conflict between <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> and Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The commentaries mentioned above and the "Quaestio" were published in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1497, 1525, etc.
