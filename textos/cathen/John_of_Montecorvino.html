<h1>John of Montecorvino</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and founder of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, b. at Montecorvino in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in 1246; d. at Peking, in 1328. Being a member of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order which at that time was chiefly concerned with the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of unbelievers, and was commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to preach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> especially to the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> hordes then threatening the West, he devoted himself to the Eastern missions, first that of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In 1286 Argun, the khan or ruler of this kingdom, sent a request to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Bar Sauma, to send <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries to the Court of the great <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> emperor, K&uacute;bla&iacute; Khan (1260-94), who was well disposed towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. About that time John of Montecorvino came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with similar promising news, and <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> entrusted him with the important mission to Farther <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where about this time <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>, the celebrated traveller, still lingered. He started on his journey in 1289, provided with letters to the Khan Argun, to the great Emperor Kublai Khan, to Kaidu, Prince of the Tatars, to the King of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>. His companions were the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nicholas of Pistoia and the merchant Peter of Lucalongo. From <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> he went by sea to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, in 1291, where he preached for thirteen months and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> about one hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Here also his companion, Nicholas, died. Travelling by sea from Meliapur, he reached <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1294, only to find that K&uacute;bla&iacute; Khan had just died, and Timurleng (1294-1307) had succeeded to the throne. Though the latter did not embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, he threw no obstacles in the way of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary, who, in spite of the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> already settled there, soon won the confidence of the ruler. In 1299 he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Peking and in 1305 a second opposite the imperial palace, together with workshops and dwellings for two hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. He gradually bought from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> about one hundred and fifty boys, from seven to eleven years of age, instructed them in Latin and Greek, wrote psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> for them and then trained them to serve Mass and sing in the choir. At the same time he familiarized himself with the native language, preached in it, and translated into Chinese the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the Psalms. Among the six thousand converts of John of Montecorvino was a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> king named George, of the race of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> John, a vassal of the great khan, mentioned by <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>. After he had worked alone for eleven years, a German associate, Arnold of Cologne, was sent to him (1304). In 1307 <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, highly pleased with the missionary's success, sent seven <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who were commissioned to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> John of Montecorvino <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Peking and chief <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (<em>summus archiepiscopus</em>) of all those countries; they were themselves to be his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Only three of these envoys arrived safely: Gerardus, Peregrinus, and Andrew of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. They <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> John in 1308 and succeeded each other in the See of Zaiton, established by Montecorvino. In 1312 three more <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> arrived from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as suffragans. John of Montecorvino departed this life (1328) <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.
