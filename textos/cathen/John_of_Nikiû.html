<h1>John of Niki&ucirc;</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> chronicler who flourished in the latter part of the seventh century. The little we know of his life is gathered from the "History of the Patriarchs" by Severus of Ashmunein. He lived under John of Semnud, Isaac, and Simeon, respectively fortieth, forty-first, and forty-second <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and seems to have played an important part in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Church both as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Niki&ucirc; (Coptic, Pshati in the Delta) and as general administrator of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. But having disciplined a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> guilty of a grave offense against <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> so severely that he died ten days later, he was deposed from both offices by the patriarch Simeon, and reduced to the rank of a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. His "Chronicle", composed very likely before his deposition, is a work of no mean value, extending from Adam to the end of the Arabic conquest. In many respects it does not materially differ from the Byzantine chronicles, which the author often copies, especially those of <a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">John Malalas</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>. But it has preserved some local traditions, not to be found elsewhere, on the ancient history of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, also some details otherwise unknown, and apparently authentic, on certain periods of Eastern Empire, in particular on the revolution which brought about the fall of Phocas and the accession of Herclius I, and the condition of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> during the seventh century. The last chapters contain a relation of the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, but little posterior to the events.

<p>This chronicle was originally written in Greek, with the exception of some of the chapters concerning <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which were very probably written in Coptic. It has come down to us in an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> version made in 1602 by an <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> scholar, with the assistance of an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> on a much older Arabic text non lost like the original. The text, unfortunately, has suffered much at the hands of the translators and copyists, especially in passing into Arabic. Such as it is, it has been the subject of a careful study and analysis by H. Zotenberg, in the "Journal Asiatique", 7th series, vols. X, XII, XIII (Paris, 1877-79), "La Chronique de Jean de Nikio&ucirc;, notice et extraits" (also in book form, Paris, 1879); later it was published in its entirety, with a French version, by the same scholar; "La Chronique de Jean de Nikio&ucirc;" (Paris, 1883), in "Notices et Extraits des manuscrits de la Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale", t. XXIV, I, pp. 125-605) (also separately, Paris, 1883).
