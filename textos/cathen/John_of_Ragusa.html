<h1>John of Ragusa</h1>  

<p>(Sometimes confounded with <a href="../cathen/08479a.htm">John of Segovia</a>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, president of the <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Constantinople, b. at <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a> about 1380; d. at <a href="../cathen/01706a.htm">Argos</a>, in the Peloponnesus, probably 1443. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> and devoted himself to the observance of the rule of his order and the study of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. By reason of his great attainments in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, and the Oriental languages, he was considered an <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> in his native <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> he shone conspicuously and there received the doctor's cap about the beginning of the fifteenth century. In the year 1426 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and went to reside at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>. There he received marks of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and esteem from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, and the former eventually named him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> for the General Council of Basle. John was, moreover, chosen to open the council, in place of <a href="../cathen/03546a.htm">Cardinal Julian Cesarini</a>, who was detained by other business. Arriving at Basle on 19 May, 1431, he on the same day arranged with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle for the opening of the council on the 23rd of the same month. The opening did not take place, however, until 23 July, 1431, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, when John preached from the text: "Et angelus testamenti, quem vos vultis. Ecce venit" (<a href="../bible/mal003.htm#vrs1">Malachi 3:1</a>). In the council he exonerated the absent <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> from the charge of contempt (Feb., 1433). On eight mornings he spoke against the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> and crushed all that was reprehensible in that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>Having been sent as a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the council to Conatantinople to urge the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a>, John of Ragusa induced the Emperor John Paleologus and the Patriarch Joseph to send an embassy to the council through the treaty which they made with <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a> was broken by the Greeks. John afterwards sojourned at Constantinople to study the Greek language and to become better acquainted with the situation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Here he completed an etymological work bearing upon the Greek text of Scripture and destined to be of service to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists in treating of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Greek schismatics</a>. He returned to Bologna as a member of a deputation, to obtain from <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> an assurance that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would be present at the council. Having acceded to this request, Eugenius employed John once more to be the bearer of a document (dated 15 July, 1437) to the Greek emperor in which the emperor's assistance was invited at a meeting of the council to be held in some Italian city. John's subsequent course has been a subject of dispute: some authors assert that he remained in sympathy with the council, while others insist that he allied himself with <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, who made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01706a.htm">Argos</a>. It is probable that he took the side of Eugenius. His extant writings are: (1) Discourse against the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> delivered at the Council of Basle; (2) the Acts, or Reports, of his embassies to Constantinople, to be found among the Acts of the Council of Basle; (3) an account of his travels in the East, preserved by <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a>. His work on Greek indeclinable nouns and Scriptural Greek etymology seems to have been lost.
