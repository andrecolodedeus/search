<h1>John of Salisbury</h1>  

<p>(JOHANNES DE SARESBERIA, surnamed PARVUS).

<p>Born about 1115; died 1180; a distinguished <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, historian, churchman, and scholar. Born near <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, he went at an early age to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he studied arts and philosophy (1136-38) under <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Peter Abelard</a>, Alberic of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13097c.htm">Robert of Melun</a>; then under <a href="../cathen/15632b.htm">William of Conches</a>, Richard l'Ev&ecirc;que, and Theoderic of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> at the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at this latter town (1138-40); finally again at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, completing his studies in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> under Gilbert de La Porr&eacute;e, <a href="../cathen/12563a.htm">Robert Pullus</a>, and Simon of Poissy (1141-45). This solid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, under such brilliant masters, he perfected by some private teaching, perhaps with his lifelong friend <a href="../cathen/11762b.htm">Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Moutier La Celle, near <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, with whom he was living in 1148. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in this year, he was introduced to Theobald, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. After spending a few years at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he went from <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> with <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and acted as private secretary to Theobald for several years, during which period he was repeatedly sent on delicate and important diplomatic missions to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in 1159 he had "ten times crossed the Alps on his road from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>" (Metalogicus, iii, prol., p. 113).

<p>He was thus brought into intimate relations with princes and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially with Henry II and his chancellor, Thomas &agrave; Becket, and with <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a>, also an Englishman. In defending the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he incurred the kings displeasure in 1159 &mdash; when his forced seclusion enabled him to complete his two principal works the "Policraticus" and the "Metalogicus", both dedicated to Thomas &agrave; Becket &mdash; and again in 1163, when he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to quit <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The next six years he spent with his friend <a href="../cathen/11762b.htm">Peter of La Celle</a>, now <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Here he wrote "Historia Pontificalis". Thomas &agrave; Becket, who had succeeded Theobald as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 1162, was soon <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to follow John into exile. The latter steadily endeavoured to promote the cause of peace between the English king on the one hand and his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on the other. Apparent success <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> those efforts in 1170, when both exiles returned. In a few months (29 Dec.) John witnessed the tragic <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the saintly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. In 1174 John became treasurer of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1176 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>. He attended the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a> in 1179 and died the next year. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Josaphat, near Chartres.

<p>John of Salisbury was one of the most cultured scholars of his day. Notwithstanding the engrossing cares of his diplomatic career, his great learning and indefatigable industry enabled him to carry on an extensive and lifelong correspondence on literary, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> topics with the leading scholars of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. His collected letters (over 300 in number), no less than his other works, form an invaluable source of the history of thought and activity in the twelfth century. His fine taste and superior training made him the most elegant Latin writer of his time. He is equally distinguished as an historian and as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>: he was the first <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writer to emphasize the importance of historical studies in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and in all other branches of learning. Naturally of an eclectic turn, he displayed in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> a remarkably sound and judicious critical spirit. Familiar with all the phases of contemporary scholastic controversies, he was himself among the first to formulate clearly the solution known as "moderate realism" in answer to the fundamental <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> problem of the value and significance of universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.
<h2>Works</h2>

<p>The "Metalogicus" is a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatise in four books, in defence of the study of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and philosophy, against a group of obscurantists whom he nicknamed <em>Cornificians</em>. It is the first <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> treatise to show acquaintance with the whole of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "organon". The "Policraticus", in eight books, deals, as its sub-title (<em>De nugis curialium et vestigiis philosophorum</em>) indicates, partly with philosophy and learning and readable miscellaneous compilation. The "Entheticus" (<em>De dogmate philosophorum</em>) is a Latin elegiac poem of 1852 lines, apparently intended as an introduction to the "Policraticus", and covering practically the same ground in briefer form. The authenticity of the "De Septem Septenis", a brief on the seven liberal arts, is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by Haur&eacute;au (Nouvelle Biographie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, xxv, 539, 1858) and Schaarschmidt (pp. 278 sq.) The "Historia Pontificalis" was first published by Arndt (Monumenta Germaniae Historica, xx, 517-45, 1868), and identified as the work of John, by Giesebrecht (Bay. Akad. d. Wissensch., <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1873, 124). The actual <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> carries on the <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a> continuation of Sigebert from 1148 to 1152. It was written about 1164, and dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11762b.htm">Peter of La Celle</a>. John also wrote a "Vita Sti. Anselmi" (1163), a "Vita Sti. Thomae Cantuar." (1171), and the letters already referred to. All these works (except "Hist Pont.") were edited by Giles, 5 vols., London, 1848, reprinted in P.L. CXCIX; "Policraticus, also ed. C.C.J. Webb (2 vols., Oxford, 1909). The materials for John's biography are contained mainly in his own letters and other works, and on the letters of <a href="../cathen/11762b.htm">Peter of La Celle</a>.
