<h1>John the Faster</h1>  

<p>(<em>&lsquo;o nesteut&eacute;s, jejunator</em>)

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (John IV, 582-595), famous chiefly through his assumption of the title "&aelig;cumenical patriarch"; d. 2 September, 595. He was brought up (apparently also born) at Constantinople. Under the Patriarch John III (Scholasticus, 565-577) he was <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the Hagia Sophia church; then he became <em>sakellarios</em> (an official who acts as patriarchal vicar for <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>). He had little learning, but was so famous for his ascetical life that he was already called "the Faster". Under <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius I</a> (restored to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> when John III died, 577-582) he became an important <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the city. At <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius's</a> death he was made patriarch by the Emperor Tiberius II (578-582). Under the next emperor, Maurice (582-602), he was still a favourite at court. There is little to tell of his life besides the great question of the title. He is said to have been tolerant towards the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>; but he persuaded Maurice to have a certain wizard, Paulinus, burnt. He had always a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for asceticism and charity to the poor.

<p>The dispute about the title was this: it was not new in John IV's time; till then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople had commonly been called <em>&rsquo;archiep&#237;skopos da&#236; patri&aacute;rches,</em> but at various times he (and other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>) had been addressed as <em>o&lsquo;ikoumenik&#242;s patri&aacute;rches</em>. H. Gelzer (Der Streit um den Titel des &ouml;kumenischen Patriarchen) thinks that it became usual in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (484-519). The first known use of it applied to Constantinople is in a letter from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Antioch to John II (518-520) in 518. Before that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> had been so called by one of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Synod of Ephesus</a> (in the year 449; Gelzer, op. cit., p. 568). Since 518 the whole combination, <em>&rsquo;archiep&#237;skopos ka&#236; o&lsquo;ikoumenik&#242;s patri&aacute;rches,</em> is not uncommonly used in addresses to the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. But they had not called themselves so before John IV. There is a real difference between these two uses of a title. In addresses to other people, particularly superiors, one may always allow a margin for compliment&mdash;especially in Byzantine times. But when a man uses a title himself he sets up a formal claim to it. In 588 John the Faster held a synod at Constantinople to examine certain charges against Gregory, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (in this fact already one sees a sign of the growing <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Constantinople. By what right could Constantinople discuss the affairs of Antioch?). The Acts of this synod appear to have been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pope Pelagius II</a> (579-590) saw in them that John was described as "archbishop and &aelig;cumenical patriarch". It may be that this was the first time that the use of the title was noticed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it appears, in any case, to be the first time it was used officially as a title claimed&mdash;not merely a vague compliment. <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius</a> protested against the novelty and forbade his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at Constantinople to communicate with John. His letter is not extant. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of it from Gregory's letters later (Epp., V, xliii, in P.L., LXXVII, 771).

<p><a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> (599-604), who succeeded <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>, was at first on good terms with John IV. He had known him at Constantinople while he had been <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> (<em>apocrisiarius</em>) there (578-584), and had sent him notice of his succession as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a friendly letter (Epp., I, iv, in P.L., LXXVII, 447). It has been thought that the John to whom he dedicates his "Regula pastoralis" is John of Constantinople (others think it to be John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, Bardenhewer, "Patrology", tr Shahan, St. Louis, 1908, p. 652). But in 593 this affair of the new and arrogant title provoked a serious dispute. It should be noticed that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> was still old-fashioned enough to cling to the theory of three <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> only, although officially he accepted the five (Fortescue, "Orthodox Eastern Church", p. 44). He was therefore not well-disposed towards Constantinople as a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> at all. That it should claim to be the universal one seemed to him unheard-of insolence. John had cruelly scourged two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. They appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the correspondence that ensued John assumed this title of &aelig;cumenical patriarch "in almost every line" of his letter (Epp., V, xviii, in P.L., LXXVII, 738). <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> protested vehemently against it in a long correspondence addressed first to John, then to the Emperor Maurice, the Empress Constantina, and others. He argues that "if one patriarch is called universal the title is thereby taken from the others" (Epp., V, xviii, ibid., 740). It is a special effrontery for the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose existence as a patriarch at all is new and still uncertain (Rome had refused to accept the third canon of the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">First Council of Constantinople</a> and the twenty-eighth canon of Chalcedon), to assume such a title as this. It further argues independence of any superior; whereas, says <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, "who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople is subject to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>?" (Epp., IX, xii, ibid., 957); and again: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>" (ibid.).



<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expressly disclaims the name "universal" for any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, including himself. He says that the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> had wanted to give it to <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, but he had refused it (Epp., V, xviii, ibid., 740, xx, 747, etc.). This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> rests on a misconception (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Histoire des Conciles", II, Paris, 1908, pp. 834-5), but his reason for resenting the title in any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is obvious throughout his letters. "He understood it as an exclusion of all the others [<em>privative quoad omnes alios</em>] so that he who calls himself &aelig;cumenic, that is, universal, thinks all other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and himself the only <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the inhabited earth" (so Horace Giustiniani at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>; <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, "Photius", I, 184). For this reason <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> does not spare his language in denouncing it. It is "diabolical arrogance" (Epp., V, xx, in P.L., XXVII, 746, xxi, 750, etc.); he who so calls himself is <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">antichrist</a>. Opposed to it <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> assumed the title borne ever since by his successors. "He refuted the name 'universal' and first of all began to write himself <a href="../cathen/13737a.htm">'servant of the servants of God'</a> at the beginning of his letters, with sufficient <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, leaving to all his successors this hereditary evidence of his meekness" (Johannes Diaconus, "Vita S. Gregorii", II, i, in P.L., LXV, 87). Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople kept their "&aelig;cumenical" title till it became part of their official style. The Orthodox patriarch subscribes himself still "Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and &OElig;cumenical Patriarch". But it is noticeable that even Photius (d. 891) never dared use the word when writing to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never admitted it. It became a symbol of Byzantine arrogance and the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In 1024 the Emperor Basil II (963-1025) tried to persuade <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">Pope John XIX</a> (1024-1033) to acknowledge it. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> seems to have been ready to do so, but an outburst of indignation throughout the West and a stern letter from Abbot William of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> made him think better of it (Fortescue, "Orthodox Eastern Church", p. 167). Later again, at the time of the final <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> writes to <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> of Constantinople (in 1053): "How lamentable and detestable is the sacrilegious usurpation by which you everywhere boast yourself to be the Universal Patriarch" (op. cit., p. 182). No <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> since then has ever dared assume this title.

<p>With regard to the issue, one should note first that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no Greek. He saw the words only in a Latin version: <em>Patriarcha universalis,</em> in which they certainly sound more <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> than in Greek. How he understood them is plain from his letters. They seem to mean that all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> comes from one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that all other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are only his vicars and delegates. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> does not affirm this of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or anyone. Diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have <em>ordinary,</em> not <em>delegate,</em> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; they receive their authority immediately from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though they may use it only in the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. It is the whole difference between <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> ordinaries and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. All <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not Apostolic vicars of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Nor has any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ever assumed the title "universal bishop", though occasionally they have been so called in complimentary addresses from other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The accusation, then, that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> successors have usurped the title that he so resented is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>.

<p>Whether John IV or other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople really meant to advance so arrogant a claim is another question. <em>O&rsquo;ikoumenik&#242;s patri&aacute;rches</em> in Greek is susceptible of a milder interpretation. <em>&lsquo;E O&rsquo;ikoum&#232;nes ch&oacute;ra</em> was long a name for the civilized, cultivated land of the Greeks, as opposed to the wild country of the barbarians. It was then often used for the Roman Empire. It is at least probable that the clause <em>&lsquo;up&#232;r t&#234;s o&rsquo;ikoum&eacute;nes</em> in the Greek Intercession of the Byzantine Liturgy means the "empire" (Fortescue, "Liturgy of St. Chrysostom", London, 1908, p. 106). It may be, then that <em>o&rsquo;ikoumenik&#242;s patri&aacute;rches</em> meant no more than "imperial patriarch", as the Greeks of Constantinople told Anastasius Bibliothecarius of the time of Photius (see his statement in Gelzer, op. cit., p. 572). Kattenbusch (Konfessionskunde, I, 116) thinks it should be translated <em>Reichspatriarch</em>. Even so it is still <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople had no sort of claim over the whole empire. The most that can be allowed is that if "ecumenical" means only "imperial", and if "imperial" means only "of the imperial court", the title (in this case equal to "court patriarch") is no worse than a foolish example of vanity. But even in Greek this interpretation is by no means obvious. In Greek, too, an "&aelig;cumenical synod" is one that has authority for the whole Church; the "&aelig;cumenic <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>" (<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>) are those whose teaching must be followed by all. Pichler's comparison with the form "catholic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>" ("Geschichte der kirchlichen Trennung", II, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1865, pp. 647 sq.) is absurd. The humblest member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is (in any language) a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; in no language could he be called &aelig;cumenical.

<p>Another dispute between John and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> was about some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, especially the head of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, that the Court of Constantinople wanted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to send to them. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> would not part with them; eventually he sent part of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> chains. The works in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> attributed to John the Faster [a treatise on Confession (P.G., LXXXVIII, 1889-1918), a shorter work on the same subject (ibid., 1919-1932), "Of Penance, Temperance, and Virginity" (ibid., 1937-1978)] are not authentic. No authentic works of his are extant. He has often been confused with a certain Cappadocian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, John the Faster, who came to Constantinople about the year 1100. The patriarch, at his death, left no <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> but a cloak, a blanket, and a praying-stool, which the emperor kept as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> has <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him and keeps his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 2 September.
