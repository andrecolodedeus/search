<h1>John &OElig;colampadius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, organizer of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> at Basle, b. at Weinsberg, Swabia, in 1482; d. at Basle, 24 November, 1531. His family name was Heusegen or Husegen, not Husschyn (Hausschein), as the hellenized form &OElig;colampadius was later rendered. Having received a preliminary classical training at Weinsberg and Heilbronn, he began the study of law at Bologna, but left for Heidelberg in 1499 to take up <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and literature. He was specially interested in the works of the mystics, without obtaining, however, a thorough foundation in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he held a small <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at Weinsberg, where he delivered his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> on the Seven Last Words. At Stuttgart (1512) he extended his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek, and at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> became friendly with <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>; returning to Heidelberg, he studied Hebrew under a Jewish convert, and became acquainted with Brenz and Capito. A little later he was appointed preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Basle (1515), where he joined the circle of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>. In 1515 he was made a bachelor, in 1516 licentiate, and on 9 September, 1518, a doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He had already resigned as preacher at Basle and returned to Weinsberg. In December, 1518, he became preacher at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, where he joined the Humanists who sympathized with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He corresponded with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, and directed against <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> the anonymous pamphlet "Canonici indocti Lutherani" (Augsburg, 1519). &OElig;colampadius, however, far from having taken a definite stand, was engaged in translating the <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings of St. Gregory of Nazianzus from Greek into Latin.

<p>Suddenly he entered the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Altom&uuml;nster (23 April, 1520). He first thought of devoting himself to study in this retreat, but was soon again entangled in controversy, when, at the request of Bernhard Adelmann, he wrote his opinion of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, which was very favourable, and sent it in confidence to Adelmann at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. The latter, however, forwarded it to Capito at Basle and he, without asking the author's permission, published it (&OElig;colampadii iudicium de doctore Martino Luthero). This was followed by other uncatholic writings, e.g. one against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on confession (Augsburg, 1521) and a sermon on the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> (Augsburg, 1521) dealing with <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> as a question of no importance and repudiating the sacrificial character of the Eucharist; these publications finally rendered his position in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> untenable. He left in February, 1522, supplied by the community with money for his journey. Through the influence of Franz von Sickingen he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in the castle on the Ebernburg. In November of the same year he removed to Basle. He publicly defended <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone (30 August, 1523). The following February he advocated the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and used his <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> to disseminate the new teachings. The progress of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> became much more marked in Basle after the Council had appointed him <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Martin's (February, 1525), on condition that he should introduce no innovations into Divine service without special authorization of the council, which included <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and was still cautious; the spread of the new teachings was partially counteracted by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which, for the greater part, was still <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in its tendency.

<p>After Karlstadt's writings had been proscribed by the Basle Council, &OElig;colampadius, in August, 1525, issued his "De genuina verborum Domini: Hoc est corpus meum, iuxta vetustissimos auctores expositione liber", in which he declared openly for <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Last Supper, construing as metaphorical the words of institution. The distinction between his explanation and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli's</a> was merely formal, &OElig;colampadius, instead of <em>est</em> interpreted the word <em>corpus</em> figuratively (corpus&mdash;<em>figura corporis</em>). Accordingly the Last Supper was to him merely an external symbol, which the faithful should receive, less for their own sakes than for the sake of their neighbours, as a token of brotherhood and a means of edification. This monograph was confiscated at Basle, and attacked by Brenz on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Swabia in his "Syngramma Suevicum" (1525), which &OElig;colampadius answered with his "Antisyngramma ad ecclesiastes Suevos" (1526). Although &OElig;colampadius had continued to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> until 1525, in November of that year he conducted the first "reformed" celebration of the Lord's Supper with a liturgy compiled by himself. In 1526 he arranged an order of Divine services under the title "Form und Gestalt, wie der Kindertauf, des Herrn Nachtmahl und der Kranken Heinsuchung jezt zu Basel von etlichen Predikanten gehalten werden". In May, 1526, he took part in the disputation at <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli's</a> absence he was unable to cope successfully with <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a>. In May, 1527, the Council of Basle requested the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers of the city to give in writing their views concerning the Mass. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was presented by Augustin Marius, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> by &OElig;colampadius. The Council as yet placed no general proscription on the Mass, but allowed each of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to retain or set it aside. In consequence the Mass was abolished in the churches under <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers and the singing of psalms in German introduced. Monasteries were suppressed towards the end of 1527. The ancient Faith was, however, tolerated for a time in the churches under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> control.

<p>After the disputation at Bern in January, 1528, in which &OElig;colampadius and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> were chief speakers on the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> side, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Basle threw caution to the winds; at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1528, and later, several churches were despoiled of their <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and pictures. In December, 1528, at the instance of &OElig;colampadius, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> petitioned the Council to suppress <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, but, as the Council was too slow in deciding, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantizing</a> of Basle was completed by means of an insurrection. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> expelled the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of the Council. The churches previously in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, were seized and pillaged. &OElig;colampadius, who had married in 1528, became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <em>antistes</em> over all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Basle, and took the leading part in compiling the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> ordinance <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the Council (1 April, 1529). Against those who refused to participate in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> celebration of the Lord's Supper, compulsory measures were enacted which broke down the last remnant of opposition from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In contrast to <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, &OElig;colampadius strove, but with only partial success, to secure for the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a greater share in its management. In October, 1529, &OElig;colampadius joined in the vain attempt at Marburg to close the sacramental dispute between the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and the Reformed. In 1531, with <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> and Blarer, he introduced <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> by force into Ulm, Biberach, and Memmingen. He was also concerned in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, and was largely responsible for their having joined forces with the Reformed at this time.

<p>&OElig;colampadius was a man of splendid, though misdirected, natural gifts. Among the fathers and leaders of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> he had not, either as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> or man of action, the importance or forceful <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, but his name stands among the first of their supporters. As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, after the full development of his religious opinions, he belonged to the party of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, though remaining independent on some important points. The opinion that he was more tolerant than the other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> leaders does not accord with facts, though <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> on the whole as regards his relations to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of other <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. The profound differences which had already appeared among the adherents of the new religion, due particularly to variations in opinion concerning the Lord's Supper, were painful to &OElig;colampadius; but in contrast to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> uncompromising attitude, he strove without surrendering his own views to restore harmony through reciprocal toleration. Towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, however, he bore the same <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and intolerance as the other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> leaders. Likewise in justifying religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he shares <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli's</a> standpoint. If his first movements at Basle were more cautious than those of others elsewhere, it was not through greater mildness, but rather out of regard for conditions which he could not change at a single stroke. As soon, however, as he had won over the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, he did not rest until <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was suppressed, and those who at first resisted were either banished or forced to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>.
