<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> created by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 27 January, 1904 by division of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Archdiocese of Montreal</a>; comprises three counties, Joliette, Berthier, and Montcalm, with four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of L'Assomption County. It forms a rectangle 105 miles long by about 45 wide.
<h2 id="section1">Religious organization</h2>

<p>The total population is 63,500 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, of whom 1200 are non-Catholics. This population is divided into thirty-eight canonically erected <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and four with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. According to its need each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> has one or another of the following associations or confraternities: the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis; the League of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, for men and children; the Congregation of the Most Blessed Virgin, for men, youths and young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; the Confraternities of Mount Carmel; Of the Holy Rosary; of the <a href="../cathen/02648a.htm">Bona Mors</a>; of the Holy Angels; the Association for Daily Adoration of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; the Association of the Way of the Cross; the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>; and the Temperance Society.

Frequent communion is observed in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the faithful generally acquit themselves well of their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. There are four vicariates-forane. Ecclesiastical conferences are held twice yearly in each vicariate.

There are 115 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 104 of whom are secular and 11 religious.
