<h1>Jonathan</h1>  

<p>(Hebrew, "Yahweh hath given", cf. Theodore; Septuagint <em>'Ion&aacute;than</em>.)

<p>Name of several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.

<p>Among these may be mentioned the following:

<p>(1) J<font size=-2>ONATHAN,</font> the son of Gersam the son of Moses, mentioned by name in Judges, xviii, 30, and as a young <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a> in xvii, 7 sqq. Having left Bethlehem, his native town, he came to Mt. Ephraim, where he was induced by a certain Michas to remain as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of an idol. This idol was afterwards seized by the Danites and carried to Lais, whither Jonathan accompanied them, and he and his descendants acted as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the idol until the days of the Captivity.

<p>(2) J<font size=-2>ONATHAN</font> (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> J<font size=-2>ONATHAS</font>), eldest son of Saul by Achinoam (<a href="../bible/1sa014.htm#vrs49">1 Samuel 14:49, 50</a>). He first appears as taking part with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and such was his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> that Saul confided to him the command of a thousand soldiers in Gabaa. Jonathan's defeat of the garrison of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> in Gabaa, and his subsequent victory on the confines of the same town are narrated in <a href="../bible/1sa013.htm">1 Samuel 13</a> and <a href="../bible/1sa014.htm">14</a>. Through an intervention regarded as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa014.htm#vrs15">14:15</a>) the latter combat resulted in a general rout of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, and Saul in the excitement of the pursuit proclaimed a rash <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, saying: "Cursed be the man that shall eat food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies." The course of the flight led through a forest where wild honey appeared upon the ground, but the people tasted it not for they feared the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But Jonathan, not having heard his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> pronouncement, innocently tasted the honey, and, when a halt was called in the evening and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> consulted <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> as to a further pursuit of the enemy, no answer was given. Saul immediately assumed that some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had been committed against the Lord, and again he rashly <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> that, even should the guilt be found on his son Jonathan, he should surely die. The lots having indicated Jonathan as the guilty one, he confessed to having tasted the honey, and was saved only by the intervention of the people (<a href="../bible/1sa014.htm#vrs45">1 Samuel 14:45</a>). When, after his victory over Goliath, the youthful <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> appeared at the court of Saul, a most deep and loyal friendship sprang up between him and Jonathan, who more than once was instrumental in saving his friend from Saul's <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> wrath (<a href="../bible/1sa018.htm">1 Samuel 18 sqq.</a>). But Saul, though having several times relented, finally became implacable, and Jonathan, seeing his efforts useless, sent his friend away to Nobe after a renewal of the mutual covenant of friendship between themselves and their posterity (<a href="../bible/1sa020.htm">1 Samuel 20</a>). Jonathan cheerfully renounced in favour of his friend his right to the throne of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, counting himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> to be second to him in the kingdom. This covenant was renewed later when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> after the siege of Ceila withdrew into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Ziph (<a href="../bible/1sa023.htm#vrs15">1 Samuel 23:15-18</a>), but Jonathan was not destined to share in the ultimate triumph of his friend. In a battle against the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> in Mount Gelboe he was slain together with his two brothers Abinadab and Melchisus, and Saul his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Their bodies were piously buried by the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad (<a href="../bible/1sa031.htm">1 Samuel 31</a>).

<p>(3) J<font size=-2>ONATHAN,</font> son of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Abiathar and faithful servant of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a>. He was instrumental in saving the king's life by securing for <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> information concerning the plans of his enemies.

<p>(4) J<font size=-2>ONATHAN,</font> (surnamed A<font size=-2>PPHUS</font>), youngest son of Mathathias and brother of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas Machabeus</a>. The patriotic exploits of this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Jewish heroes are narrated in the First and Second <a href="../cathen/09495a.htm">Books of the Machabees</a> and also in the works of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiquities, XIII). After the defeat and death of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> (about 161 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) Jonathan was chosen leader of the patriotic band, at the time hard-pressed and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. But the death of the unworthy <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a> brought about a change in public sentiment, and the invading general Bacchides withdrew into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> giving the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a respite of two years. Encouraged by the party of the Hellenists or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, however, he made a new attempt to subjugate the country. This attempt was foiled by Jonathan, and the result of the short campaign was a treaty whereby the latter remained practically master of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. This state of things continued for six years with a continued increase of power and influence on the part of the Machabeans, so that an alliance with their party was solicited by Bales and Demetrius, the two competitors for the Syrian throne. Jonathan decided in favour of Bales who, having vanquished his rival, bestowed upon Jonathan not only the title of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a>, but also that of <em>Strategus</em> of his country and that of Ruler of a part of the Syrian empire (<a href="../bible/1ma010.htm#vrs1">1 Maccabees 10:1-66</a>). After many military exploits (<a href="../bible/1ma011.htm#vrs60">1 Maccabees 11:60-74</a>) Jonathan sent ambassadors to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to renew the treaty made by <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> with the Roman Senate, and he also entered into an alliance with the Spartans (<a href="../bible/1ma012.htm#vrs1">1 Maccabees 12:1-23</a>). For a time it seemed as if he were destined to restore his country to complete independence, but Tryphon, the aspirant to the throne of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, recognizing in Jonathan his chief obstacle, made him a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by foul treachery and put an end to his career by casting him into a dungeon (<a href="../bible/1ma012.htm#vrs24">1 Maccabees 12:24-54</a>). The rule of Jonathan extended from 161 to 143 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>
