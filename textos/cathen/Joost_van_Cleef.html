<h1>Joost van Cleef</h1>  

<p>(JOSSE VAN CLEVE).

<p>The "Madman", a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> born in Antwerp c. 1520, died c. 1556. He was one of twenty van Cleefs who <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, but whether the well-known Henry, <a href="../cathen/04011a.htm">Martin</a>, and William (the younger) were kin of his cannot be determined. Of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, William (the elder), we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only that he was a member of he Antwerp Academy, which body Joost joined. Joost was a brilliant and luminous colourist, rivalling, in this respect, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, whose methods he followed. Severity and hardness of outline somewhat marred his otherwise fine draughtsmanship. Portraiture in the sixteenth century was represented by Joost van Cleef; and Kugler places him, artistically, between <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a> and <a href="../cathen/10555b.htm">Antonio Moro</a>, his "Portrait of a Man" in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> (Pinakotheck) being long attributed to Holbin. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The celebrated portrait <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of Cologne, Bruyn, was a pupil. Imaging himself unappreciated, he went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and was presented to <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Phillip II</a> by <a href="../cathen/10555b.htm">Moro</a>, the court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>.

<p>Because <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, according to English authorities chose <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian's</a> pictures in preference to his, van Cleef became <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">infuriated</a>, and his frenzy later developed into permanent <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">insanity</a>. The French contend that it was Philip, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, who gave <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> the preference. The most distressing feature of Joost insanity was that he retouched and ruined his finished pictures whenever he could gain access to them, and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> finally had to place him under restraint. Beautiful altar-pieces by van Cleef are found in many <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> churches, notably "The Last Judgment" (Ghent). Perhaps the most celebrated of his works is the "Baccus" (Amsterdam), whose young face is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with prematurely grey hair. "A Virgin" (Middleburg) is noteworthy as having a charming landscape for the background, a combination rare in those days. Other works are: "Portrait of the Painter and his wife", at Windor Castle; "Portrait of a Young Man", at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>; and "Portrait of a Man", at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>.
